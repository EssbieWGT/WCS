(Courtesy of City of Omaha)OMAHA — A random sampling of about 5,000 Omaha households is receiving orange postcards in their mailboxes as part of an effort to guide future growth of Nebraska’s most populated city.
The postcards contain directions on how to tap into a roughly 12-minute survey designed to gauge what Omahans want their city to look like over the next two decades.
It’s part of the “We Make Omaha” initiative that’s been holding events and gathering information. The end goal: produce a 20-year master plan that will shape policies and land-use decisions influencing quality of life, housing, development and transportation. The existing plan has served Omaha for about three decades.
The orange postcards mark the latest outreach to solicit opinions. 











Decisions we make through the comprehensive plan will shape Omaha for decades. This survey gives residents a direct opportunity to influence those decisions and help ensure the plan reflects what matters most to the community.


– Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr.



Josie Schafer, who heads the Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, said her team is assisting the City of Omaha in the survey effort. She believes it is the first large-scale survey associated with Omaha’s planning operations.
Over the next few days, the 5,000 households should be receiving a second postcard urging participation. The first went out to them earlier this month.
As of mid-week, about 200 households had completed the survey, said Schafer, who is hoping for at least 1,000 responses to assure what she said is an acceptable margin of error for the findings. A third reminder postcard will hit mailboxes in February.
Coordinators are hoping to have all responses by the end of February and expect to report results in early May.
Recipients of the postcards, which provide a code to access an online survey, were randomly selected but include a cross-section of neighborhoods, said Schafer. Responses are confidential and will be anonymized before analysis.
Printed surveys can be requested. The surveys also are offered online in Spanish, and other translations are available, coordinators said. 
In addition to the postcards, an “open access survey” is offered online to people who aren’t in the sample group. As of mid-week, about 500 people had responded to that offering. Schafer said the open-access option will offer an opportunity for additional opinions and comparisons to the sample group.
Among the survey questions: What amenities help you enjoy a place? What type of homes would you prefer to live in? What types of development should the city prioritize? In two words, describe Omaha today.
“The decisions we make through the comprehensive plan will shape Omaha for decades,” said Mayor John Ewing Jr. “This survey gives residents a direct opportunity to influence those decisions and help ensure the plan reflects what matters most to the community.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A former Senate majority leader who opposed same-sex marriage is advancing toward a lifetime appointment as a member of the Rhode Island Judiciary, despite advocates’ objections.
The Senate Committee on Judiciary voted 13-1 Wednesday to advance Gov. Dan McKee’s nomination of Michael McCaffrey to fill a District Court vacancy to the full chamber for confirmation. The committee also gave its unanimous approval for McKee’s three other picks to fill judicial vacancies on the Superior and Family courts.
“Whether in this building or in my practice of law or in the community, I have worked with individuals navigating difficult situations and I have worked to help them overcome them,” McCaffrey, a Warwick Democrat, told the committee during his introductory remarks. “It’s the culmination of these experiences that I believe make me qualified as a justice of the District Court.” 
If confirmed, McCaffrey would fill the seat left vacant by Melissa R. DuBose, who now serves as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The annual base salary for a state District Court judge is $199,075.
Also moving toward a full Senate vote: Assistant Attorney General Shannon Signore, who McKee nominated to fill a vacancy on the Providence County Superior Court. Magistrates Andrea Iannazzi and Alberto Aponte Cardona Sr. were picked to fill two Family Court vacancies.
McCaffrey served in the Rhode Island Senate from 1995 through the end of the 2022 legislative session, including as majority leader from 2017 until his final term concluded.
Colleagues on the panel praised his work and fair demeanor, as did Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Erin Lynch Prata — herself a onetime senator who noted the two didn’t always agree on policy.
“There was always a tremendous amount of respect,” she said. “Our disagreements were confined to the policy, they never devolved to personal attacks.”
Lynch Prata also pointed to McCaffrey’s legislative record in helping shape today’s court network, including laws that created a drug court, a mental health treatment calendar, and mandates fora more diverse judiciary.
“The legislation that he is responsible for passing not only made Rhode Island safer and more responsive to Rhode Islanders’ needs, but also set Rhode Island courts on a path our neighboring New England states are striving to catch up to,” she said.
But McCaffrey’s Senate record has also drawn plenty of criticism from progressive groups like the Womxn Project, which took to social media last July to oppose his appointment before his initial interview before the Judicial Nomination Commission.
A conservative member of his party, McCaffrey was part of the leadership team that allowed a vote on codifying abortion-rights to go to the floor in 2019. He voted against the measure that ultimately passed.
He was also among 12 senators who voted no when the chamber passed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage in 2013.
“It’s a lifetime appointment that’s going to impact so many people’s lives,” Jocelyn Foye, the Womxn Project’s director and co-founder, said in an interview before the committee meeting. “And he’s not a good representative of all of the people.”
The Wakefield-based organization issued another call to action Monday, urging the public to contact McKee and Senate President Valarie Lawson to halt McCaffery’s nomination from going forward.
Lawson appeared on the panel in her ex-officio role, approving McCaffery’s advancement. She has previously stated that McCaffrey had the “highest integrity” and a deep knowledge of the law.

At his interview before the Judicial Nominating Commission last July, McCaffrey said his understanding of such social issues has “evolved.” He said he would be an impartial jurist if appointed — a message he reiterated before lawmakers Wednesday.
“I have always treated everyone with dignity and respect both in and out of public service,” he said. “If appointed, I will continue to ensure that every person who enters my courtroom remains seen, heard, and treated equally under the law.”
Foye remained skeptical. She pointed to an op-ed in the Boston Globe penned by former Sen. Gayle Goldin, a Providence Democrat, who claimed the former majority leader has gone back on his word before. 
“That’s a character picture,” Foye said. “He claims he’s changed, but that’s so hard to believe considering how long he had worked in the Senate against so many organizations during his period of time there.”
It’s a similar concern shared by Sen. Dawn Euer, a Newport Democrat who cast the lone vote against McCaffrey’s advancement. 
Euer was deputy director for the successful campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in 2013. With LGTBQ+ rights under the crosshairs of the Trump administration, she said it’s “critically important” that the District Court vacancy is filled by someone with a record of protecting civil liberties.
“I think it’s possible he evolved, but I don’t think based on words we should be awarding a lifetime appointment,” she said in an interview. “If someone evolves in one direction, can they evolve in another?”
Other committee members praised McCaffery’s character. Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, noted that while the governor’s judicial pick may have been against certain policy issues, he did allow them to go to the Senate floor for robust discussion.
“That’s very indicative of someone who understands that it’s not all about personal views,” McKenney said.
McCaffrey, along with McKee’s other judicial appointees, will be considered for confirmation by the full Senate some time next week, chamber spokesperson Greg Paré said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Legislation allowing Iowa community colleges to offer four-year degrees in some subjects — an idea strongly opposed by Iowa private colleges — was narrowed Wednesday before passing out of an Iowa House committee.
The Iowa House Higher Education Committee also passed a number of other bills Wednesday to change community college and public university operations, including bills that would tax university endowments and freeze tuition.
A majority of the bills discussed by the committee Wednesday came with amendments, including one attached to legislation that would allow community colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees.
Committee chair Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, said House Study Bill 533 would bring about the “most significant reform to the community college system as we know it since it was incepted about 60 years ago.” He said he hopes that those in rural areas without access to higher education can use community college bachelor’s degree programs to fill critical gaps in education, nursing and others.
“I believe we can close these workforce gaps, and this bill does exactly that,” Collins said.

While the original bill would have authorized all community colleges in Iowa to begin developing baccalaureate degrees, the amended legislation would create a pilot program in which only colleges that are 50 miles or more away from the main campus of a public university or the main campus of a private university already offering the same programs are allowed to start bachelor’s degree programs.
These degree programs must also meet certain requirements — they must lead to jobs in high-demand fields that have unmet workforce needs in the area, “as demonstrated by multiple workforce indicators” like job openings, wage data and more, the amendment stated. They also must fall under the areas of nursing, education, information technology, public safety, business, health care management, agriculture or dental hygiene.
Community colleges would not be allowed to offer more than three bachelor’s degree programs, the amendment stated, and participating schools would need to submit reports to the Iowa Department of Education and the General Assembly showing enrollment, completion, workforce outcomes, alignment with regional workforce needs, tuition, challenges and more.
Once the first students of community college baccalaureate programs start graduating, the General Assembly would examine the pilot program’s outcomes and decide if it needs to be changed or expanded.
Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo, called the amendment a “good starting point” in addressing the needs of people who are place-bound and those who don’t work well with online education. The amendment and the bill both passed and will head to the Iowa House floor for debate.
Collins also introduced an amendment to House Study Bill 538, which would make changes to presidential search committees at state universities and make candidate names confidential until they sign an agreement with the search committee. The amendment changed the bill to allow a “variety of stakeholders” to hold a spot on the search committee instead of just Iowa Board of Regents members, Collins said, including “one student member, one faculty senate member, one staff member, one alumni foundation or public member.”
Rep. Heather Matson, D-Ankeny, said while she appreciated the change to allow for “slightly more” shared governance in the presidential search process, she believes the legislation is still too prescriptive.
“I do still have concerns overall of the partnerships — they’re very critical partnerships within communities that are diminished, or could be diminished, and civic engagement possibly being diminished by having this level of micromanagement from the Legislature,” Matson said.
After last year’s search for the new president of Iowa State University, in which two candidates dropped out and one had positive views on lab-grown meat, Collins said he is “no longer willing to roll the dice” on the presidential search process. The legislation passed the committee as amended.
Passed legislation focused on university finances
House Study Bill 531, which would freeze tuition for all students from enactment until July 2031, was amended to strike references to mandatory fees, narrowing the legislation to just tuition.
Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, introduced multiple amendments to the legislation, which failed to pass, including calls to include private K-12 schools that receive vouchers from the state to also have their tuition frozen and to increase the percentage of state support that goes to university operating budgets to help support them through the freeze.
Jacoby said discussions of funding need to focus on investment in students, rather what is being given to universities. He added that other costs of college, including rent, food, transportation and course materials like books, are not included in the amended legislation.
“At a time when our economy is tanking, we need to invest in our students to keep them here and improve the economy upon their graduation,” Jacoby said.
The bill, with Collins’s amendment, passed the committee.
House Study Bill 540, to make public universities responsible for a portion of defaulted educational loans of their graduates, also passed with amendments, and Collins said during the committee he would be open to discussing further changes. The amendment changed the amount of liability from 25% of the amount owed to 10%.
Collins said this legislation is addressing the lack of responsibility from universities “for the consequences of providing degrees that do not lead to viable employment” and ensures they will provide a quality education focused on “student outcomes and achievement.”
Matson echoed concerns she shared during the subcommittee meeting on the bill, saying there are many high-demand jobs that don’t pay very well, such as direct care work for children and older adults, and universities could be on the hook for outcomes they can’t control, like varying pay rates. She added that guardrails should be placed in the legislation to address the different reasons someone may default on their loans.
“I would just say that making something less bad doesn’t still make it OK,” Matson said.
The thresholds included in House Study Bill 544, which would establish a tax on certain university endowments, were raised through amendment from $250 million to $500 million. Collins said during the meeting the amendment would also lower the tax rate from 15% to the current highest corporate tax rate and ensure it applies only to unrestricted funds within endowments.
Funds collected through the tax would go to scholarships for students studying to enter high-demand job fields, Collins said.
Brown-Powers repeated her point from the subcommittee that this bill would be “stealing from Peter to pay Paul” and set a precedent that could lead to fewer donations going to impacted universities. Instead of a tax, she suggested trying to work with universities to move endowment money “in a more proactive way.”
Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, said he’d like to see a study on how the tax would impact universities before it is implemented, as Iowa State University has at least 60 endowed faculty positions.
“I still think it’s kind of funny that you want to tax stuff when you are usually anti-taxing,” Brown-Powers said to Collins.
Collins said the funds in university endowments shouldn’t just sit there idly, “but actually be used for the benefit of Iowa students,” especially those hoping to enter high-demand fields.
House File 546, as amended, would require that continuing education requirements for licensed professionals, including those in Iowa Supreme Court and Iowa Board of Educational Examiners, relate directly to their work.
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, said amendments would add in language excepting continuing education courses required by state or federal law and stating that the Iowa Supreme Court must adopt rules “so that a person is not required to graduate from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association Council for their education prior to taking the bar exam.” The amendment was approved by the committee.
While he was initially “a little skeptical about the bill,” Holt said after reaching out to people to discuss the legislation he heard from people who feel like their time is wasted by a lot of required continuing education courses.
Wilburn expressed concern about potential subjective ways of taking the legislation, in which some people believe something isn’t necessary but professional boards maintain it is.
“I prefer us to lean towards the folks that we have in the professions on these boards to help determine what that criteria is,” Wilburn said.
Holt said Wilburn raised good questions during the committee meeting, and he is currently working to meet with people in the judicial branch and other areas to discuss the legislation and its potential impacts further. Professional boards would make the decisions about what continuing education courses are directly related to the job or not, he said.
He said during discussion of the amendment that he’s not sure if the legislation is a “finished product” at this point, and he wants to hear from people to make any changes for when the bill goes to the House floor. Both the amendment and legislation were approved by the committee.
Few bills with no amendments
One piece of legislation moved ahead without amendment was House Study Bill 541, which would have the board of regents study how it could implement a performance-based funding model for state universities and submit a report to the Legislature.
Both Matson and Jacoby pointed out situations where performance-based funding has not worked out, including in K-12 education, where Matson said it pits teachers against one another and reduces collaboration in addition to being very complicated. Jacoby said he’s experienced “creaming” before, where institutions focus only on their top people and ignore lower-performing groups.
When asked by Matson where the idea behind the bill came from, Collins said “many other states have moved in this direction” or have considered it, citing Texas as an example. He acknowledged Jacoby had a point in asking about the potential challenges and negative aspects of a performance-based funding model for universities, but said this bill would do nothing more than charge the board with creating a report on the topic.
“The establishment of a performance-based funding system for Iowa’s regents enterprise, I believe, represents a forward-thinking approach that we certainly have to consider as a committee,” Collins said.
House Study Bill 530, which would implement an 80% residency requirement for the University of Iowa’s nursing bachelor’s program, also passed without amendment.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina’s economy has seen explosive growth since 1970, rising to eleventh in gross domestic product in the nation. But according to a new study from the left-leaning think tank Urban Institute, the state’s income growth has lagged behind the rest of the country.
Released on Tuesday, the study found that the median household income in North Carolina rose from $56,952 in 1970 to $70,804 in 2023, adjusted for inflation, according to Census Bureau data. That represents a 24.3% increase, placing North Carolina 40th in the country in income growth — behind all of its neighbors.
“North Carolina kept running and made real gains, but other states sprinted ahead faster,” said researcher Brady Meixell, who co-led the study. “They’re still doing decent on attracting and growing and retaining talent, so it’s really about connecting that talent to higher-wage jobs.”

North Carolina led the region in household income in 1970, ahead of neighbors South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and Tennessee, and 25th in the country overall. As of 2023, it had fallen to 34th in the country, lagging behind the growth of all four states. It now has a lower median household income than Georgia and Virginia.
Nowhere is there a starker contrast than North Carolina’s northern neighbor, Virginia, where median household income has skyrocketed since 1970 — increasing by 60.1% from $56,161 to $89,931 — despite a lower GDP than North Carolina.
Meixell said North Carolina’s relatively lower growth is somewhat surprising, given that the state performed well in two important metrics correlated with income growth: college-educated and foreign-born population growth. North Carolina ranked 13th in the growth of the former and 14th in the growth of the latter.
“A state like North Carolina made strong gains in education and immigration, which are two of the biggest predictors of income growth that we saw, but only modest income gains compared to other states in the country,” Meixell said. “Population growth alone is not going to deliver that prosperity. It’s a need to really think through the economic mix of the state.”

The period spans more than 30 years of Democratic control of the governorship and General Assembly and more than a decade of Republican control of each. It encompasses both Democratic promises to grow income through investments in education and a GOP plan to grow income by slashing taxes.
The clearest impact in the data set is from the 2008 financial crisis. From 1970 to 2000, median household income in North Carolina grew by 22% to $69,356. But by 2010, most of those gains were wiped out, with the median household income falling to $59,790, only 5% above its 1970 median — making it 45th in the U.S. in income growth by that point. Only in the years since have incomes in the state rebounded.
“We keep hearing this Sun Belt story about warm weather and low taxes driving growth,” Meixell said. “Those advantages alone aren’t really enough to guarantee rising income.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P2260479-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-28 20:57:03.728852

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)“The ability of machines to make predictions, recommendations, or decisions normally done by people.”
That’s the definition of artificial intelligence (AI) used in the “action plan” issued Wednesday by a state task force charged with examining the now-omnipresent technology that continues to reshape the surface of all things digital — and many things physical.
“AI is one of the most transformative technologies that we will all experience in our lifetime, and Rhode Island is being proactive,” Chris Parisi, president of Trailblaze Marketing and the task force’s vice chair, said during a media briefing Wednesday at Rhode Island College (RIC).
“We need all Rhode Islanders, all business leaders, every elected official, to really take this seriously,” Parisi said. “Again, this is the most important thing that we’re doing right now. Believe me, the most transformative technology is going to affect how we work, how we live, how we learn.”
The Governor’s AI Task Force was formed by an executive order in February 2024 and first met in July that year, beginning its mission of molding recommendations and policy suggestions for responsible and wise use of AI. Since the task force’s inception, generative AI has become properly unignorable, from the banality of viral videos featuring irate foods to the seriousness of spoofed evidence in court and concerns about the technology’s requisite data centers eating up natural resources. 
In December 2024, the task force broke up into six “fact-finding teams” that looked at major areas of concern spanning government, education, health care, finance, small businesses, and manufacturing and defense. The task force wondered: How can Rhode Island stay competitive in this increasingly crowded field?
“We all know that AI will affect every corner of our state’s economy,” said Jim Langevin, the former congressman who chairs the task force and serves as distinguished chair for RIC’s Institute for Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies, at Wednesday’s briefing. “The question for Rhode Island is not whether AI will change our economy, but whether we are prepared to take full advantage of the benefits while thoughtfully managing the risk.”
A map included in the report emphasizes the ubiquity of efforts to bring AI into the embrace of state oversight, showing Rhode Island is one of 38 states with AI task units. 
President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has made AI an indispensable concern of his administration. Among Trump’s efforts to cultivate the machines are a January 2025 executive order meant to smash “Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,” as well as the president’s own AI action plan, published in July 2025. Even Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has locked horns with Trump over his December 2025 executive order that attempts to rebuff state-level regulation of AI.
Rhode Island’s AI task force also wants state government, industry and education to embrace the technologies more fully, but not unconditionally. 
“We’re not looking to have the government in this area lay out strict regulations about AI,” said RIC Professor Tim Henry, who runs the school’s Bachelor of Science program in Artificial Intelligence and led the task force’s eight-member sub-unit of academic leaders from across the state. “What we’re looking to do is pull a cross-sector group together that is going to advise.”
The group would have representatives from academia, industry and government, Henry said.
“Our goal was not just adoption, but responsible adoption that puts Rhode Islanders first,” Langevin said.
The report frontloads workforce development as a reason to pursue a more coordinated approach for AI usage. As the nature of work and life continue to be subsumed by a technology Langevin likened to the internet, the task force identified four overarching themes that “transcend industry needs” and can translate into “focused action.” They include:

Education and “upskilling” the workforce, including initiatives like incentivized AI training, apprenticeship programs and AI accreditation to broaden workers’ AI literacy
Government leadership, such as piloting AI in government services — perhaps chatbots or virtual assistants to help with certain constituent services — and improving technical support for policy management, plus “visible integration of AI into physical government services” such as the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s bus service
Developing frameworks for use, which would include a “centralized AI guidance body” 
“Collaboration and scale,” which seeks to form cross-industry and cross-region partnerships as well as establish AI for Rhode Island (AI-RI), a virtual and physical hub that would serve as a source for guidance and collaboration and hopefully reduce “red tape” in government applications of AI 

The report concludes with a recommendation to “appoint owners for each of the thematic areas to drive opportunities outlined in this report” but does not identify who those owners would be.
The report’s conclusion reads, “Implementation and coordination and innovation of how Rhode Island’s AI journey occurs should be industry led, in close collaboration with academic, government, and community partners.”
“This should be looked at as a blueprint,” Langevin acknowledged. “It should not be looked at as a one-and-done.”
Stay tuned on AI-RI
Though the task force painted its plan in broad strokes, its members did have ideas for what color palette to use. Langevin said the state has begun two initiatives: a working group within the state Department of Administration, and an AI Center of Excellence based in its division of Enterprise Technology Strategy and Services. 
Chief Digital Officer Brian Tardiff, head of the state’s enterprise IT office, said the state is looking to award a vendor Center for Excellence project by the end of spring. 
But as to the larger question of where leaders will congregate, Tardiff pointed to the AI-RI hub mentioned in the report. Langevin described it as a place where businesses could “use and understand trusted AI tools” — and experiment with models and algorithms using their own data — as the state and its academic partners, like RIC’s cyber institute, lay the groundwork for shared capacity. 
The theme of a shared framework goes as far as suggesting the “creation of secure and stable technology stacks for state-wide stakeholders in AI operations” and to “build or designate a secure, shared data and compute environment for approved AI projects.”
What tools specifically would be part of this suite? Henry said the task force landed on no particular preference for which AI models or programs might be endorsed and used, and whether those models would be proprietary or open-source ones. He suggested the task force would likely land on “a core set of tools,” with each industry then building on that base depending on its needs.

Henry offered a less agnostic answer about security: Whatever is ultimately recommended in that technology stack, security would be “one of the most critical factors of all of this.” 
Some of the report’s recommendations can be acted on now without government intervention, Henry said. 
“A lot of the opportunities in each of the industry sectors they can start and take advantage of right now,” Henry said. “They don’t need to wait for funding from the government. They don’t need to wait for direction, necessarily, from the state.”
Finance is among the sectors most prepared to adopt AI, Henry said. “They’ve been using [it] in different forms for a number of years” he said. But manufacturing has been slow to adopt the technology.
Still, Henry added, in the task force’s conversations with and surveys of Rhode Islanders, all industries appeared receptive.
“What has come out of finance, and they have been probably the most vocal about this, is the need for workers,” he said. “What’s holding them back right now is they don’t have an AI workforce:  people who understand AI, who can implement it safely and securely.”
The task force’s creator, Gov. Dan McKee, arrived late to the briefing because, he said, he had “things going on in the hospitals.”
“That was a long call,” the governor said, then reiterated his commitment to helping the state lead on AI. 
“It’s not a fad,” McKee said. “We need to make sure that we’re keeping the people working, building things that matter, and those things will pay off for dividends for decades to come.”

Attorneys on both sides of the animal cruelty case gave a preview at a Wednesday hearing of their arguments and lined out the particulars of a likely upcoming jury trial. 
The post Judge suggests wolf captor Cody Roberts’ felony case will proceed to trial appeared first on WyoFile .","GREEN RIVER—A Sweetwater County judge on Wednesday told Cody Roberts’ defense attorney that his interpretation of state law “goes too far,” a suggestion that the Daniel resident’s felony animal cruelty charge is headed toward a March jury trial. 
District Court Judge Richard Lavery did not rule from the bench after a 2.5-hour hearing on a motion to dismiss the case and exclude an expert witness. A written decision is forthcoming, he said. 
But Lavery made it clear that he wasn’t persuaded by a primary argument posed by Roberts’ attorney, Robert Piper: Specifically, that there is a “specific, clearly enumerated exception” in Wyoming statute that exempts the “hunting, capture, killing or destruction of any predatory animal” from the state’s animal cruelty laws.  
“It just seems a bridge too far that the state can’t pursue [charges],” Lavery told the courtroom. There’s “at least a space,” he added, for Sublette County Prosecuting Attorney Clayton Melinvovich to present evidence in pursuit of a conviction. 
On Feb. 29, 2024, Roberts took a muzzled wolf into the Green River Bar in Daniel for hours, appearing in photographs to make a joke out of the injured animal’s plight. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department fined him $250 for possession of warm-blooded wildlife, declining to send the case to court in pursuit of stiffer penalties. When photos and videos became public about a month later, the incident incited global outrage and condemnation that rattled the small western Wyoming community. 
This is a breaking news story that will be updated.

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — Doubts about a person’s citizenship status could be used to challenge their right to vote in South Dakota, if a proposal approved by a legislative committee Wednesday becomes law.
A person initiating a challenge would have to be registered to vote in the same county as the person being challenged. South Dakota’s secretary of state or a local county auditor’s office could also raise a challenge. The challenge would have to be filed with the county auditor at least 90 days before an election.
The Secretary of State’s Office, which oversees elections in South Dakota, requested the bill.
Supporters of the measure said it would strengthen voting integrity.
“If you find somebody who’s not a citizen and is trying to vote, then do something about it,” said Thomas Deadrick, deputy secretary of state. “This would be a way to do something about it.”

There are no specifics in the bill about what kind of proof a person would need to disprove another person’s citizenship. Deadrick gave examples that ranged from a copy of a person’s immigration visa to a sworn statement concerning a conversation about citizenship.
Sen. Liz Larson, D-Sioux Falls, was the only Senate State Affairs Committee member to vote against the measure. She raised concerns about what evidence or proof is needed to challenge a person’s vote and whether the state should give everyday citizens that authority.
“It just seems too nefarious to me, to give that right,” Larson said afterward.
Federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens this month in Minneapolis. Larson said “especially in today’s environment,” the bill is “adding fuel to the fire.”
“To have those issues of people challenging citizenship for other people, it comes with so much baggage and especially now with a lot of the violence that’s going on in Minnesota,” Larson said. “I think this is too far.”
Other opponents said the bill is redundant, because there are already state and federal laws against non-citizens voting.
Melissa McCauley, a lobbyist for South Dakota Voices for Justice, said the legislation “does not add enforcement authority, new tools or cleaner standards,” and “creates administrative work without added value.”
The bill now goes to the state Senate floor.
Committee also approves ballot transparency bill
Another bill advanced by the committee Wednesday would specify that images of cast ballots made by a type of vote-counting machine used in four South Dakota counties are public records. It would also specify that cast vote records — spreadsheets full of voting tabulations — are public records. Sen. Tom Pischke, R-Dell Rapids, introduced the bill.
The counties with machines capable of producing cast ballot images are Brown, Lincoln, Minnehaha and Pennington. Counties would not be required to use the machines. There are protections in the bill against releasing images containing personally identifying or other sensitive information.

Pischke said the bill’s intent is to make the election system as open as it can be.
“As a Legislature, we provide transparency in the budget-making process, we provide transparency in the legislative process, and we do that because the people deserve it,” he told the committee. “Election results should be no different.”
Thomas Oliva, the Hughes County finance officer, said he had to process about 8,000 ballots in the 2024 general election. He shared concern for the amount of work that could be required of officials in the state’s larger counties if requests are made for the cast-ballot images.
“I don’t know in my office how I would be able to get this done personally,” he said. “I hope those commissions take a look at that administrative duty that this creates for their auditor.”
Lincoln County Auditor Sheri Lund agreed with the concern.
The committee sent the bill to the Senate without opposition.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-29 00:46:25+00:00,Mississippi Today,One of the ‘lucky ones’: College students deal with the winter storm aftermath,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/28/college-students-winter-storm/,"An ice-covered tree blocks a street in Oxford on Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026.","The threat of a snow storm didn’t scare Lina Semmar. 
The freshman studying sports management at the University of Mississippi grew up in New England. It was ordinary to get a lot of snow — even multiple inches — overnight during the winter. 
After campus officials emailed students late last week about safety plans and preparation for the impending winter storm, Semmar stocked up on snacks like microwavable macaroni and cheese bowls and bags of potato chips. She tried using Instacart, a grocery pickup mobile app, for groceries, but many items were out of stock. 
Everyone was being dramatic, she recalled thinking. She was certain the snow wouldn’t stick and class would resume Tuesday morning. 
“But ice is a whole different ball game,” Semmar said. 
Ice, a lingering hazard from the storm, is why roadways across hard-hit areas of the state remain treacherous and tens of thousands of Mississippi residents remain without power. 
On Wednesday, UM officials announced on Facebook that the university will remain closed until Feb. 8 — two weeks after the storm. 
The university’s Oxford campus, as well other parts of Lafayette County, are experiencing “down trees and powerlines, falling ice and hazardous road conditions,” the statement notes. The student union is operating as a warming center for students and employees. 
Other Mississippi colleges and universities are experiencing similar challenges because of the weather.

Officials at Mississippi Delta Community College in Moorhead, for example, announced on Facebook that the campus will remain closed through Thursday because of the weather and widespread power outages. Northwest Mississippi Community College, in Senatobia, will remain closed through Friday because of ongoing freezing temperatures and hazardous road conditions. Mississippi Valley State University, in Itta Bena, is slated to open Monday “pending improved conditions and power restoration.”
Semmar is among the Mississippi college students who found themselves reeling from the storm’s aftermath, as residence halls and other campus buildings lost power. Some buildings with back-up generators have intermittently gained and lost electricity throughout the week. 
Fallen trees and powerlines blocked campus streets and roadways in the northern part of the state, making it difficult for students to leave campus during the first few days since the storm. Students who stayed on campus may have had difficulty getting food. Aside from power outages, the icy roads meant food service staff and other workers could not safely travel to work.
Encountering hazards after the storm
On Saturday night, when snowfall first hit UM’s Oxford campus, it was mainly slush, Semmar said. 
She and her friends were walking across campus that night when they ran into university police. Campus police told them that a powerline near Northgate Drive had fallen. Multiple patrol cars blocked the main street, and officers warned they needed to return to their dorms quickly for safety. It wasn’t until her dorm, Crosby Hall, lost power Sunday morning that Semmar began to panic.

“Everything just escalated overnight,” she said.
Jack Leslie, an Ole Miss freshman studying public health, considers himself one of the “lucky ones.” 
When the ice storm hit the campus Saturday night, Leslie’s Residential College South dorm lost power briefly. His building was one of the first to have power restored. 
Leslie had also gone to Kroger with friends to stock up on food and groceries before the storm. 
Campus officials had prepared for Rebel Market, a dining hall, to be the main source for meals — burgers, salad and other items — during the storm recovery, and meal plans are not required. But, it took hours for Leslie and his friends to get food. 
“There were just insanely long lines for everything,” Lesile said. 
Jacob Batte, a spokesman for Ole Miss, said volunteers served 3,200 meals to students on Sunday at Rebel Market, a campus dining option. 
Even walking across campus has felt dangerous to Leslie. Collapsed trees, ice and debris have fallen on cars and buildings, even blocking walkways in The Grove, a grassy greenspace at the center of campus. 
“They were even warning us not to walk over there because there were falling tree limbs and ice,” Leslie said. “It was heartbreaking to see.” 
Leslie decided to leave the campus. He and his older sister, who lives in Oxford, called their father to pick them up Tuesday evening. They went home to Grenada to stay with their parents.

Semmar also decided to leave campus. After spending days struggling to find warm food, she told her mother she planned to brave the roads and drive home to Chattanooga, Tennessee. She made plans to pack and leave Tuesday afternoon. 
Before the trip, Semmar took her Stanley tumbler, a steel insulated cup, to her car’s windshield to break off nearly two inches of ice. She blasted the car’s defroster. 
“I needed to go home,” Semmar said. “I need three meals a day, warm water and to be in the comfort of my family because I didn’t even know what would happen next.” 
While pulling out of the campus parking lot, she saw helicopters flying overhead. She took it as a hopeful sign, that “things are starting getting better,” and resources are on their way, she said. 
Gov. Tate Reeves had signed an executive order Monday to deploy the National Guard to aid in storm recovery efforts in the state. 
“Oxford is such a tight-knit community,” Semmar said, “and seeing how everyone is rallying together around this situation makes me grateful.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/25182853/IMG_7995-1.jpg,,,2026-01-28 19:56:28.429640

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s population rose slightly between 2024 and 2025 and is now at its highest level since 2017, the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development announced Wednesday.
Alaska had an estimated 738,737 people as of July 1, 2025, the department said in its annual state population estimate.
The rise comes despite a revision that erased thousands of international immigrants that the U.S. Census mistakenly believed had moved to Alaska.
Last year, relying on Census figures showing that thousands of people had migrated to Alaska from other countries, the department estimated Alaska’s population at more than 741,000 people. 
Since then, and after prodding from Alaska state demographer David Howell, the Census Bureau retroactively lowered the number of international migrants that came to Alaska, and this year’s state population estimate is significantly lower than the one published last year.
“We think (that) is more accurate given that people crossing the southern border aren’t very often making their way to Alaska,” Howell said.
With the extra residents removed and a new baseline in place, the state’s population grew on a year-over-year basis because the number of births in the state exceeded the number of Alaskans who died. 
That natural increase — births minus deaths — of 3,389 people was greater than the number of people who moved out of the state.
Between 2024 and 2025, 1,740 more people moved out of Alaska than moved here. It was the 13th consecutive year of negative net migration in Alaska, extending the longest streak of negative net migration since 1945. 
Overall, the state’s population grew by 0.22%. That was less than the nation as a whole (0.5%). Compared with the other 49 states and the District of Columbia, Alaska’s population growth ranked 40th. 
South Carolina (1.5%), Idaho (1.4%) and North Carolina (1.3%) had the highest growth rates among states. Vermont (-0.29%), Hawaii (-0.15%) and West Virginia (-0.07%) had the lowest and were among five states that posted population declines.
The U.S. Census Bureau has slightly different figures than the state — it estimated a 0.1% population gain between 2024 and 2025 — but the Alaska Department of Labor conducts surveys of military bases and group homes that the Census Bureau does not, Howell said. For that reason, he believes the state’s estimate is more accurate than the Census Bureau’s. 
Overall, Howell said, Alaska seemed to simply extend existing population trends between 2024 and 2025.
“We’re continuing to see losses in the working-age population. … We’re really starting to see declines in the school-age population. It was growing slightly at the beginning of this decade, but at this point, there’s about 1,000 more 17-year-olds than there are 4-year olds. And so we’re just going through aging,” he said.
Alaska’s median age is 37.1, one and a half years older than it was at the start of the decade. Haines, the state’s oldest community, has a median age above 50.
As the state ages, the number of new births is dropping and the number of deaths is rising.
Howell and the Department of Labor and Workforce Development are predicting that the state’s population will start dropping steadily by the year 2050. 
The number of births in the latest population estimate is the lowest since the trans-Alaska oil pipeline was built. The number of deaths dropped slightly last year, but Howell said there may be a morbid reason for that: The COVID-19 pandemic peaked in Alaska in 2021-2022 and may have killed elderly Alaskans who would have died later.
This year’s state population estimate retroactively updated the population change between 2021-2022, turning it from a small gain into a decline. 
On a borough and city level, existing trends continued in the latest forecast. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough continues to be the fastest-growing large area of the state, the population of Anchorage is relatively flat, the Interior’s population is growing slightly and Southeast Alaska’s population is falling.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — New legislation could outlaw lab-grown meat in South Dakota.
It passed 45-22 in the state House on Wednesday and will now go to the Senate.
Rep. Julie Auch, R-Lesterville, said Tuesday during the bill’s first committee hearing that she proposed the legislation with concern for “the takeover of the livestock industry here in South Dakota.” She said that “takeover” is being orchestrated by people claiming the cattle industry is bad for the environment.
“Being a witness to my industry being taken over by a society that is more concerned with climate change and sustainability is disheartening,” Auch told the House Agriculture Committee. “I am not going to stand by and allow global elites to take over South Dakota’s livestock industry.”
Lab-grown meat labeling, fees for serving legal papers, stenography rule change signed into law

Additional supporters of the proposal alleged the chemicals and processes used to create lab-grown meat can cause health problems. Rep. Tesa Schwans, R-Hartford, described the process as “a petri dish that’s full of hormones and sludge.”
Other lawmakers pushed back, citing freedom of choice.
Rep. Kevin Van Diepen, R-Huron, said he doesn’t like lab-created meat, but that doesn’t mean it should be banned.
“We shouldn’t hold back the free market,” he said. “If people want to buy this stuff, let them buy it.”
Some opponents worry that passing the bill could open the state up to lawsuits, similar to ones filed against state bans in Florida and Texas. Auch said her bill is modeled after a law in Nebraska.
Last year, South Dakota legislators passed a law requiring lab-grown meat to be clearly labeled. They also passed a law prohibiting the use of state money for the research, production, promotion, sale or distribution of lab-grown meat. There’s an exception for public universities, which can still do research on lab-grown meat. But the law prevents, for example, the awarding of state economic development grants to companies that sell the product.
Auch’s bill would effectively ban lab-grown meat by adding it to the state’s list of adulterated foods.
Opponents worry about listing a product as “adulterated” with laws that say those products are “filthy,” “putrid” and “unfit for food.”
Taya Runyan spoke against the bill Tuesday on behalf of the South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association.
“We do not support the cell-cultivated proteins,” she said. “However, not supporting them and not wanting people to eat them is altogether different than defining it as adulterated.”
Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, said she spoke with a cattle producer about the bill.
“There’s producers out there that are not viewing this as competition or infringement on their production,” she said. “I’m not comfortable with us saying what people can and can’t spend their money on in South Dakota.”
Three other bills have been introduced this legislative session that could ban or temporarily ban lab-grown meat. Two have been withdrawn, and the other one hasn’t had a hearing yet.

Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, speaks into the microphone at his first game as LSU's public address announcer. (Courtesy of Dixon McMakin) As he has hinted in recent weeks, state Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, said Wednesday he will enter the race for Louisiana’s 5th District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
McMakin, 39, has represented House District 68 in the Louisiana Legislature since January 2024. His professional background includes work as a financial adviser, insurance broker and attorney.
“This campaign will be powered by conservative conviction and a new generation of leadership ready to take the fight to Washington,” McMakin said in a statement. “I’ll stand shoulder to shoulder with President Trump to advance the America First agenda: securing the border, slashing reckless spending, crushing woke insanity, and unleashing economic growth that actually benefits working families.”
The 5th District covers portions of the Baton Rouge area and reaches the northeastern corner portion of the state, including Monroe. Its boundaries were altered in 2024 after a federal judge required Louisiana to add a second seat in the U.S. House among the state’s six that favors the election of a Black representative. 
To do so, Gov. Jeff Landry and Republican leaders in the legislature protected Letlow’s base in Northeast Louisiana and sacrificed the 6th District that Garret Graves held. Though Graves is also a Republican, he opted to back longtime friend Stephen Waguespack, placing him in the doghouse of Landry and his GOP backers.
In a brief statement Wednesday, Graves ended all speculation about his possible entry into the 5th District race.
“We are thankful for all of the strong support and encouragement to run for Congress in the newly-open 5th Congressional District race,” Graves said. “This is not the time nor office that makes sense. I will not be running for Congress this election. There is a strong demand for people-focused representation and leadership in Louisiana. I am confident the right opportunity to help fill this void will arise in the future.”
McMakin joins two other declared Republican candidates — state Sen. Rick Edmonds of Baton Rouge and Board of Regents chair Misti Cordell of Monroe  — in the election to replace Congresswoman Julia Letlow, who will challenge incumbent U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy in the state’s GOP primary in May.
During two years in the legislature, McMakin has aligned himself with Landry’s conservative agenda, though he hasn’t garnered support for more ambitious objectives such as eliminating the state income tax or a calling a constitutional convention.

This past fall, McMakin literally became among the most prominent voices in Louisiana when he took over the public address announcer’s role at Tiger Stadium from the retiring Dan Borne. He also leads radio broadcasts of Catholic High School football for his alma mater. 
Qualifying for the May 16 closed congressional party primaries in Louisiana will take place Feb. 11-13. Party runoffs, if needed, are scheduled for June 27, with the general election set for Nov. 3.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)White coats abounded at the Roundhouse Wednesday, with doctors and medical students roaming the halls in medical garb and lobbying for proposals, including House Bill 99, sponsored by Reps. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos) and Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena). HB99, if passed, would remove a provision in state law that allows for punitive damages in medical malpractice lawsuits to come from personal liability of health care providers.
The Republican affordability agenda 
The first bill that House Republicans mentioned during a news conference last week that opened the 30-day session seeks to give New Mexican first-time homebuyers zero-interest loans worth up to 20% of the purchase price.
The proposal is part of the Republicans’ “affordability” agenda, said Rep. Rebecca Dow (R-Truth or Consequences), in opening remarks to reporters last week. (The move is in step with the national Republican platform — President Donald Trump has been pressing a new “affordability” agenda, while still suggesting Democrats invented the word).
To that end, Dow sponsored House Bill 176, which drafters released late Tuesday. The seven-page bill directs funds that would otherwise go to the Early Education Childhood and Care Fund, which Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has tapped for her universal childcare initiative, ultimately toward a new “zero interest down payment loan fund” that the state Department of Finance Administration would oversee. 
Dow told Source New Mexico last week that the bill is a way for the state to help families directly benefit from recent oil and gas revenue surpluses.
“We want families to be able to solve their own problems,” she said. “And I think homeownership is critically important to the American dream and creating self-sufficiency.”
Forty-seven bills lawmakers introduced so far this session mention “housing” amid a statewide shortage and growing homeless population. The Legislature is mulling more than $100 million for housing programs and homelessness prevention this session, as well.
‘Law Enforcement 101’
Late into the afternoon Tuesday, the state House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee was scheduled to discuss three public safety bills. 
However, House Democrats went into caucus — and stayed there for about two hours. When the committee convened, it immediately rescheduled discussion of a bill focused on juvenile firearm use while one of its sponsors, Rep. Nicole Chavez (R-Albuquerque), worked on amending it.
Then, after much discussion, it also rescheduled taking action on House Bill 49, which would increase penalties for people with felony convictions who are caught owning a gun. Bernalillo County Sheriff John Allen and other supporters of the bill called it “Law Enforcement 101.”
“I want to think of it not just as reactive, but as proactive…It helps us not have another victim,” Allen told lawmakers. “If they know there’s a penalty, most likely they will not do it.”
Not everyone was convinced, though. Attorney Denali Wilson, who spoke during public comment on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico, said this bill would represent the fourth time in five years that lawmakers have revised this criminal penalty.
“If harsher punishments were effective in reducing…firearm-related crime, we would’ve seen results by now,” she said.
Immigrant Safety Act amendment passes

The House Judiciary Committee voted 6-4 on Wednesday to accept an amendment to House Bill 9, the much-discussed “Immigrant Safety Act,” that would also ban county jail employees from referring inmates into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.
Sponsors introduced the amendment Tuesday to prohibit what are known as ICE “287(g) agreements.” The agreements deputize local law enforcement to serve ICE warrants on local arrestees and transfer them to ICE custody.
HB9 as initially drafted would have prohibited public entities like counties from contracting with ICE for immigration detention, something Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham supports. Whether the governor will support the amended bill remains to be seen. A spokesperson from her office did not respond to Source’s request for comment prior to publication.
NM lawmakers add ban on law enforcement agreements with ICE to Immigrant Safety Act

The bill cleared its first committee in a vote along party lines after contentious debate last week.
Game Commission bill
Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) introduced Senate Bill 104, which tweaks the removal process for members of the state wildlife governing board. Last year, lawmakers passed legislation reforming the state’s wildlife agency and governing board, but Lujan Grisham struck the proposed removal process in the Legislature’s final days.
SB104, if passed, allows the governor to initiate a removal proceeding, which is overseen by the New Mexico Supreme Court, a pared down version of the original process that required state ethics officials to open a proceeding in the state’s district courts. Conservation, wildlife and hunting organizations that championed the 2025 reforms say they support the new removal process. 
“We appreciate the governor for following through on her commitment to work with our coalition and adopt these good government reforms,” Judy Calman, the New Mexico director of policy for Audubon Southwest, wrote in a statement. “It’s true that the removal process outlined in SB5 would have required lengthy judicial proceedings for removing commissioners.” Calman says the “compromise” negotiated by Lujan Grisham and Wirth “establishes a fair and timely removal process that we support, and we hope the legislation will pass quickly so we can meet our common goals of upholding the integrity of the commission.”
Looking ahead
In December, Source NM reported that the New Mexico Rural Library Initiative sought $29.5 million to keep the lights on at 60 libraries serving rural and tribal communities. Shel Neymark, executive director of the library initiative, at the time told lawmakers that these libraries do more than lend books to residents.
“They tend to provide early childhood education, after school programs, adult education,” he said. “They also do economic development, they connect people with healthcare, they step up during natural disasters and provide help for citizens.”
The Senate Indian, Rural and Cultural Affairs Committee will review such a proposal Thursday morning. 
The House Transportation, Public Works and Capital Improvements Committee will discuss Senate Bill 2, which would fund statewide highway improvement projects in part by increasing registration fees for passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. The bill drew some sharp debate on the Senate floor last week when Sen. Jay Block (R-Rio Rancho) argued that it would unfairly pass increased costs onto consumers.
The House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee on Thursday will review House Bill 59, which would increase prison stays for certain felonies resulting in death from 18 to 25 years.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A municipal court judge suspended for threatening truant students with deportation told a judicial disciplinary committee Wednesday that he meant well and had issued “empty threats” he couldn’t carry out only to scare the children into attending school.
Britt J. Simon was booted off the bench last February for erupting at three students and their parents during truancy hearings in Bound Brook. In three separate cases in August 2024 and January 2025, he grilled the students and their parents about their immigration status and, in one case, warned a 14-year-old girl from El Salvador that he would personally alert immigration enforcement officers to pick her up if she missed another day of school.
Wednesday, Simon told members of the Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct that he had never received training in truancy cases and merely parroted the tough talk he’d seen other judges use during truancy hearings. He conceded he intentionally made the hearings “unpleasant,” but that his goal was noble — to get the children to go to school.
“Sometimes, compassion isn’t pretty,” Simon said during his hearing at the Richard J. Hughes Justice Complex in Trenton.
Gov. Sherrill says impeachment of U.S. homeland security chief ‘has to happen immediately’

After five hours of testimony and as dusk approached, the committee’s chair told attorneys the hearing will be continued to a later date that has yet to be scheduled.
Maureen G. Bauman, the committee’s disciplinary counsel, had urged the panel to bar Simon permanently from the bench.
“Judge Simon does not have the proper temperament to be a judge,” Bauman said. “The words he used to children — who were not even parties to the proceedings — were egregious and totally improper, regardless of respondent’s intent. Respondent lacks the character, proper temperament, and judgment required of a jurist.”
Under New Jersey law, parents or guardians of habitually late or absent students can be charged with disorderly conduct, the lowest level offense. In cases of chronic truancy and absenteeism, judges can fine parents, direct school districts to address barriers to attendance like transportation, mandate interventions like home instruction, or even declare students juvenile delinquents, but state education officials recommend supportive rather than punitive approaches to reducing truancy.
Bauman, who noted that Simon also failed to ensure a municipal prosecutor was present at the truancy hearings, played recordings of the proceedings in court Wednesday.
In one, Simon told the 14-year-old on Jan. 28, 2025, just a week after President Donald Trump began his second term, “there’s a new sheriff in town.”
“You’re illegal, you’re getting deported. You know a great place to find people to deport is? The courts,” he said to the girl and her mother.
He told a 16-year-old boy from El Salvador, “You’re spitting in the face of this country.”
When the boy informed Simon he planned to enlist in the military after school, the judge responded that he was “incapable” of graduating and the military “doesn’t want garbage.” He then threatened to have child-protective workers remove him from his home and investigate his mother.
“You, all by yourself, are going to be responsible for all of the horrible things that happen to your family. You!” he barked at the boy. “Otherwise, you get your tail into school every single day. I don’t care if your limb is hanging off you, OK, and you lose a leg. OK? You hop. Are we clear?”










Respondent lacks the character, proper temperament, and judgment required of a jurist.


– Maureen G. Bauman, disciplinary counsel


Simon conceded in court Wednesday that he was “uncomfortable” enough with how he handled those truancy hearings that he reached out to Judge Gerard J. Shamey, the municipal presiding judge in Somerset, Hunterdon, and Warren counties, for guidance on how to handle truancy cases better.
Shamey testified Wednesday that he advised Simon not to “improvise,” citing a script judges should follow to alert people in the country illegally of the consequences a guilty plea could have on their continued U.S. residency.
The case comes as immigration agents around the country have increasingly targeted courthouses for enforcement, arresting undocumented people in court hallways when they appear in immigration and other routine proceedings.
In New Jersey, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner issued a directive in 2019 barring judges from requesting or retaining people’s immigration statuses except “when needed to fulfill a legitimate court purpose.”
Simon was appointed a part-time municipal court judge in 2023 in Bridgewater and became a full-time judge in Bound Brook in January 2024, according to court testimony. He previously was an attorney who worked in mergers and acquisitions in Manhattan before starting his own firm in 2008, where he focused on municipal practice, he testified.
He told committee members that his comments to truant students and their mothers were not meant to signal any political position he has on immigration enforcement.
“Everybody has their own view. You might have a view about immigration far to one side or to the other side. That’s above my pay grade, and candidly, I think it’s above my ability to actually process,” he said.
Wednesday’s hearing also gave a rare peek into the interplay between politics and the courts in a state where dozens of state legislators are attorneys.
Simon told the committee he thought he got called before Judge Kevin Shanahan, the assignment judge for Somerset, Hunterdon, and Warren counties, last February because he’d goofed when sentencing a client of Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union). Scutari is a personal injury attorney and one of New Jersey’s most powerful lawmakers as Senate president.
In that case, Simon testified, he mistakenly sentenced the client — a repeat DWI offender — as a first-time offender and did not suspend his driver’s license as the law requires. The state Motor Vehicle Commission flagged that penalty as “an illegal sentence,” Simon said. He thought his meeting with Shanahan was to receive guidance in how to resentence Scutari’s client, and was “thrown back” when Shanahan instead took the meeting in a different direction and suspended him for the truancy cases, he said.
“I’ve always operated under the principle that if you’re going to tell me to fix something, I’m going to fix it,” Simon said. “Judges make mistakes.”

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Under a new bill introduced Wednesday, the Idaho Legislature would ban local policies in more than a dozen cities that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. 
New Idaho bill would fine cities for flying LGBTQ+ pride flag

The bill, written by the Idaho Family Policy Center, a conservative Christian group, and sponsored by Nampa Republican state Rep. Bruce Skaug, would block local governments in Idaho from having more strict antidiscrimination policies than established in state law. 
Skaug argued that the varying local rules hinder economic growth.
“In addition to threatening our religious freedoms, all of these conflicting local antidiscrimination ordinances create a tangled web of red tape that varies from city to city, county to county,” Skaug told lawmakers. “In the business sector, it burdens the entrepreneurs and the employers.”
The bill comes after more than a decade of failed efforts in the Idaho Legislature to add LGBTQ+ discrimination protections to state law. 
Since 2011, 13 Idaho cities and towns have passed nondiscrimination ordinances including Sandpoint, Boise, Idaho Falls, Moscow, Lewiston, Meridian, Ketchum, Hailey, Bellevue, Driggs, Victor, Pocatello and Coeur d’Alene. In 2020, Ada County, home to Boise, passed its own, KTVB reported. 
Chelsea Gaona-Lincoln, executive director of Add the Words Idaho, a group that has pushed for LGBTQ+ antidiscrimination protections, called the bill embarrassing.
“There are real issues Idaho needs addressed,” she said in a statement. “Lawmakers should move on and find something meaningful and responsible to do with the time and taxpayers’ money. Let queer and trans people live in peace.”

 Idaho Family Policy Center, which wrote the bill, echoed Skaug’s arguments

The Idaho House Local Government Committee voted to introduce Skaug’s bill Wednesday, teeing it up for a full committee hearing with public testimony. All 14 Republicans on the committee supported introducing it, and the committee’s two Democrats opposed it.
Rep. Steve Berch, a Boise Democrat, called the bill “an overreach of legislative power or state power over the cities and communities.”

Skaug told the committee that the bill would ban more than just local antidiscrimination policies for LGBTQ+ protections, saying it would also prevent housing-related measures that deal with income and familial status. In an interview after the committee hearing, Skaug couldn’t immediately share which localities have those other nondiscrimination measures. 
In preparing the bill, Skaug told the Idaho Capital Sun that he worked with the Idaho Family Policy Center and the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. 
In a statement, Idaho Family Policy Center President Blaine Conzatti said local antidiscrimination ordinances “are frequently weaponized against small business owners — especially wedding vendors or those offering creative design services.”
“No small business owner should ever be forced to choose between violating their sincerely held religious beliefs or leaving the marketplace altogether,” he said. “… Government officials have forced bakers, photographers, florists, graphic designers, and wedding venue operators to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies and pride festivals.”

In 2013, the Idaho Falls City Council first passed an ordinance barring LGBTQ+ discrimination in housing and employment, becoming the seventh Idaho town with such protections at the time, Boise State Public Radio reported. In 2020, the Idaho Falls City Council expanded the discrimination protections to public accommodations, the Post Register reported. 
In a statement, Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates’ Idaho State Director Mistie DelliCarpini-Tolman critiqued the bill as stripping local control.
“In places across Idaho, locally elected officials are ready and willing to stop discrimination, and this bill blocks them from doing exactly that, what voters elected them to do,” Tolman said. “That isn’t small government. It’s a uniform denial of basic protections that tells LGBTQ+ Idahoans and other marginalized residents that their safety and dignity don’t matter.”

Electrical service is slowly returning in regions of north Mississippi and the Delta after this past weekend’s ice storm, even as brutally cold temperatures linger in many places.
State and local officials stressed Wednesday that major obstacles remain for restoring power, clearing roads and providing water.
Officials with state departments of Transportation and Public Safety both warned of traveling woes. Late Tuesday, a combination of ice and wrecks brought traffic to a standstill on Interstate 55 and Interstate 22 in north Mississippi.
Social media posts recounted people in frigid conditions being stranded on the highways all night.
On Wednesday evening, the highways were closed for northbound traffic from Batesville to Senatobia on I-55 and for all lanes of I-22/U.S. 78 from the Tennessee state line to Red Banks, northwest of Holly Springs
“If you are on Interstate-55 north of Batesville or on Interstate-22 north of Lake Center, please turn around immediately,” the Department of Public Safety warned in a frantic social media post. “Road crews are currently working to remove stranded vehicles from the interstate. These roadways are in extremely dangerous condition. Additionally, other state highways and county roads may also present similar conditions. Please only travel in north Mississippi if necessary and use extreme caution.”
One person posted on social media that he was trapped on I-55 from 6 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday,
Gov. Tate Reeves said Wednesday that storm also has resulted at least 10 deaths. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency reported a fatality each in Jefferson and Lincoln counties related to the use of gas space heaters and another in Alcorn County along the border with Tennessee connected to the use of a gas oven in an attempt to stay warm. Five fire deaths in the aftermath of the storm are under investigation. 
“Because many roads are still impassable, responding to some of these fire scenes has been slow,” State Fire Marshal and Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney said. “In some areas, fire departments are unable to respond at all. What we’re seeing, and have seen historically, is improper heating issues like getting space heaters too close to bedding or using outdoor heating equipment indoors. I cannot overstate the importance of safely using heating equipment and having a working smoke alarm and carbon monoxide alarm. I pray we don’t see more loss of life as extreme cold is predicted to continue for several days.”
President Donald Trump on Saturday approved an emergency declaration for Mississippi for this winter storm. State and local officials are assessing damage, which is one step toward Reeves declaring a disaster and asking the Federal Emergency Management Agency for aid, the governor said Wednesday. Reeves said assessing damage takes longer after an ice storm than after a tornado, partly because of widespread power outages.
Tippah Electric Power Association, which serves areas along the border with Tennessee in north Mississippi, announced it would begin restoring power by prioritizing medical facilities and nursing homes, water distribution systems, grocery stores and gas stations. Then “our focus will be restoring the largest number of customers the quickest.”
Tippah Power Association’s service area was hit especially hard because of damage to the distribution lines from Tennessee Valley Authority, which provides electricity for the rural power association.
State officials said Wednesday that Mississippi has received 60 generators from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and has used 35 so far, including one at a nursing center in Tippah County. Power was restored at a hospital in in Tippah County.

In Lafayette County in north central Mississippi, the lights were slowly coming back on, but Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill said the city’s water system experienced problems.
Tannehill said Wednesday while 10 of the city’s 16 main power circuits were back online, news around the water system was less encouraging. Crews were working to identify a possible water leak in the south part of town to determine if additional steps are needed to stabilize the system.
Tannehill said water would remain turned off in certain areas to ensure enough pressure remains so Baptist Memorial Hospital-North Mississippi can have adequate access to water.
Tannehill also said National Guard troops were arriving in Oxford Wednesday and would begin setting up food and water distribution sites.
According to poweroutage.us the number of electrical outages in Mississippi had dropped from about 125,000 customers  late Tuesday to about 105,000 by Wednesday evening. The peak was about 180,000 during the weekend. Mississippi on Wednesday still had the highest percentage of outages – about 7% – of all the states that were pummeled by the massive winter storm.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee reversed course on its denial of more funding for prison beds. 
The committee voted 5-1 Wednesday to approve funding for more than 900 prison beds in the Colorado Department of Corrections after hearing more from the department and the governor’s office earlier this week about why the beds are needed. 
When the committee does not appropriate funds for beds, it results in a heavier reliance on jails to hold people sentenced to state prison until beds become available, Mark Ferrandino, the director of the governor’s Office of State Planning and Budgeting, told the committee Monday. He said the state will spend the requested money regardless, because if it doesn’t go to state prisons for more beds, it will go to county jails that are holding the people awaiting transfer.

The backlog of people in county jails awaiting transfer reached just under 700 as of Jan. 20, and without more prison beds that number could surpass 1,000 by June, Ferrandino said. Someone being held in a county jail does not have access to the full medical services and programming that prisons offer for rehabilitation, and it costs the state more to pay for beds in county jails than it does to pay for beds in prisons.

The state will need to lease or purchase another facility to address capacity shortages, Ferrandino said, because efforts to reduce recidivism and prison population management measures required by a 2018 law will not open up enough beds. He said the governor’s office is reviewing a bill introduced this year that would expand the prison population management measures, which were activated for the first time last year when the state prison vacancy rate fell below 3% for 30 consecutive days. 
The committee unanimously approved the department’s full request for funding to pay local jails for the beds they use to house people awaiting intake to a state prison, as well as its full request for medical care. Last week, the committee had only approved 50% of those requests.










We understand that the Joint Budget Committee wanted to act in the short term, but now we must turn our attention to the bigger, long term crisis plaguing DOC.


– Hilary Glasgow, executive director of Colorado WINS


Sen. Judy Amabile, a Boulder Democrat, was the only vote against approving the beds, though other Democrats on the committee signaled their support was conditional on a more comprehensive plan to address prison capacity. Amabile emphasized that Colorado WINS, the union that represents state employees including those who work in state prisons, asked the committee to deny the beds due to safety concerns and a lack of appropriate staffing. 
Hilary Glasgow, executive director of Colorado WINS, said the prison staffing crisis puts its members, the incarcerated population and the public at risk, which is why WINS for the first time opposed the department’s request for more beds. 
“We understand that the Joint Budget Committee wanted to act in the short term, but now we must turn our attention to the bigger, long term crisis plaguing DOC, and that means making sure existing funding is being spent where it should be, and more funding is allocated to fix staffing,” Glasgow said in a statement. 
Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican, said the DOC, community corrections and the parole board need to find a joint solution to getting people already approved for parole out of prison, because the department does not have complete control over who is released from state prisons. 
Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, and Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, both said they supported the additional beds because it would end up costing the state more to pay county jails. 
In 2010, Colorado had 23,000 people in its state prison system, which represented about 0.45% of the state’s population, according to Ferrandino. The state has closed seven prisons since then and reduced capacity by 12%. By the end of 2025 the population was about 16,500, which is about 0.27% of the state’s population, he said.
People convicted of nonviolent crimes make up 38.6% of the population in state prisons. That includes crimes like burglary, motor vehicle theft and arson, Ferrandino said.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Ethics Commission adopted several updates to its complaint process Wednesday, including a change that allows complaints filed in bad faith to be dismissed and for members of the public to report potential violations anonymously.
The Ethics Commission investigates complaints related to potential unethical conduct by some state public officials and candidates. In response to concerns that bottlenecks in the complaint process were prolonging those investigations, the state Legislature passed a handful of policy amendments to state law last year.
Many of the rule changes approved Wednesday implement those amendments. 
“I believe this is quite an accomplishment,” Ethics Commission Chair Cynthia Lindquist said during the meeting.
Legislators in 2025 directed the commission to create a process to handle bad faith complaints amid concerns that public officials were using complaints as a weapon to harm their political opponents.
The amended rules consider bad faith complaints to include those filed “to harass or impugn the reputation” of the accused. 
Any complaints that fit this definition may be dismissed, the rules say.
Previously, the commission considered making bad faith complaints punishable by fines, though commissioners decided against it. Executive Director Rebecca Binstock said that this was because the state law that establishes the commission’s complaint process doesn’t say the body can penalize filers.
Commissioners also expressed concerns that fines could discourage citizens from reporting potential ethics violations, she said.
The complaint process now allows complaints to be filed anonymously. Previously, complaints had to include the filer’s identity, which commission staff have said often dissuaded people from making them.
North Dakota Ethics Commission considers fines for ‘weaponizing’ complaint process

Additionally, the updated rules give people accused of ethics violations a formal avenue to request complaints to be dismissed. The accused can ask the commission to toss complaints on the grounds that they aren’t subject to the commission’s jurisdiction, that they don’t clearly state a violation, don’t follow the commission’s rules or were submitted in bad faith.
The amendments also allow the commission to informally settle ethics complaints directly with the accused. Previously, the board could only mediate informal resolutions between the accused and the filer, which were rarely successful.
Another update to the rules includes new time management standards for processing ethics complaints. The standards state that the commission shall dismiss complaints outside of its jurisdiction within 60 calendar days. It also mandates that the executive director report on the status of each complaint that has been pending for more than six months at quarterly meetings, and to report on the status of complaints older than one year at every regular meeting.
The commission as of Dec. 31 had 42 pending complaints. During the 2025 session, Ethics Commission staff also requested funding for an additional staff member to help carry the board’s workload. They noted complaint filings to the commission had risen significantly in recent years. The Legislature denied the request.
In its Wednesday meeting, the commission also discussed a new proposal to allow for public comment at future meetings. Commissioners are considering accepting in-person and virtual comment at meetings, as well as written testimony.
The commission indicated it will revisit the public comment proposal at its next meeting in February.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A Minneapolis-based human rights group is suing the Department of Homeland Security, accusing DHS officials and agents of illegally and systematically preventing detained immigrants from meeting with their lawyers.
The proposed class action lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court of Minnesota, was brought on behalf of the Advocates for Human Rights and a St. Paul woman referred to by the initials “L.H.M.”
According to the complaint, L.H.M., who has lived in Minnesota since 2019 and has a pending asylum claim, was arrested Monday after a routine check-in at ICE’s Office of Intensive Supervision in Bloomington.
After L.H.M.’s family contacted her attorney, the lawyer immediately travelled to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building but was unilaterally refused access to L.H.M.
L.H.M. recently underwent cranial surgery, the lawsuit states, and “has significant medical needs that may be severely adversely affected by detention conditions or involuntary transfer out of state.”
According to the claim, federal agents at the Whipple Building — and at least one ICE attorney — have repeatedly told frustrated lawyers that “no visitation between detainees and attorneys is or has ever been permitted at Whipple.”
“This is false,” the complaint continues. “Whipple has rooms labeled ‘ERO Visitation,’ where attorneys have met with clients held at Whipple for years.”
Nowadays, when lawyers attempt to arrange visits at Whipple, phone calls and emails allegedly go unanswered.
According to the suit, one lawyer was recently threatened with arrest at the Whipple Building, despite having received prior permission from agency officials. Another attorney attempting to speak to a client was “confronted by six armed security personnel, one of whom said, ‘We’re not having a debate here, turn your car around and get the hell out of here.’”
The lawsuit asserts claims under the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedures Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
This is not the first time DHS has been sued for impeding detainees’ access to counsel. Similar suits in New York and Illinois have resulted in court orders.
DHS also has a recent history of defying court orders.
On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz, chief judge of the Minnesota district, issued an order in a habeas petition in which he identified 96 court orders that ICE has violated since January 1 – a tally that he said is likely an undercount because it was assembled in haste.
“This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law,” wrote Schiltz, who was appointed to the bench by George W. Bush and clerked for Antonin Scalia, the late Supreme Court justice and conservative icon.
“ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence,” Schiltz wrote.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260116_0610-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 19:56:28.429640

Henry McMaster gives his State of the State to a joint session of the Legislature on Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025 at the Statehouse in Columbia, SC. (Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster in his final State of the State address Wednesday urged legislators to stay the course to keep South Carolina thriving.
South Carolina’s longest-serving governor used his ninth speech to the General Assembly to celebrate the initiatives he successfully advocated for during his tenure. Those triumphs include pay raises for teachers and law enforcement, funding for police officers in every school, 400,000 acres of land conserved across the state and scholarships offering free tuition to some 120,000 South Carolinians attending the state’s technical colleges.
“Let us continue to think big, to be bold, to embrace civility and comity through our thoughts, words, and deeds — and to urge our people, especially our young ones, to be proud of their state,” McMaster said.
“The best is yet to come,” he added.
McMaster touted the nearly $7 billion in active road projects underway across the state, up from $2.7 billion in 2017, when the Legislature passed a road-funding law.
“However, inflationary construction and labor costs threaten to create crippling delays and busted budgets,” McMaster cautioned. “It’s critical that this year’s budget invest an additional $1.1 billion in new surplus money to keep them moving and on schedule.”
He pointed to rankings from U-Haul rental company showing South Carolina as the number one destination for their moving trucks and vans in 2025. And the U.S. Census Bureau this week declared that South Carolina was again the fastest growing state in the nation last year.
“Left unaddressed, we will face future problems with water and sewer access, traffic congestion, road and bridge repair, demand for electric power generation, public safety, school overcrowding and healthcare availability,” McMaster said. “Therefore, I submit to you that the time has come — and reality requires — that we assess whether our state’s infrastructure and government services will be able to catch up if this unrestrained out-of-state population growth continues.”
McMaster also will spend his last year as governor pushing for changes to how county-level judges, known as magistrates, are selected.
The judges — most of whom aren’t attorneys — handle a large caseload, from setting bonds for those arrested on minor criminal charges to evictions and foreclosures. Magistrates are technically appointed by the governor. But they’re actually chosen by their local senators, who control when and if they’re replaced.
Each county funds its own magistrates’ salaries and court facilities. This arrangement, according to McMaster, has led to pay disparities.
McMaster called for the state to start funding these judges’ salaries. And he wants them to be lawyers.
To help more rural counties where attorneys may be less prevalent, he wants the Legislature to waive requirements that magistrates live in the counties where they hear cases.
The governor also urged South Carolinians to celebrate the history that has shaped the state, as this year marks the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution.
“Many historical sites still need markers today, including the camp of General Francis Marion and his patriots in the Pee Dee swamps,” he said. “The British could not find it and neither can we, so far.”
McMaster even told legislators he has invited the duke and duchess of Edinburgh to the Palmetto State for Carolina Day – the state’s annual commemoration of the Battle of Fort Sullivan.
South Carolinians played a major role the fight for American independence, with more than 200 battles and skirmishes fought in here, more than any other colony.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — The South Dakota Senate approved a bill Wednesday that would make state officials involved in a big contract with a company wait longer before accepting a job with that company.
The 34-0 vote sends the bill to the state House of Representatives.
Under current law, state officers and employees involved in awarding or overseeing a contract with a company must wait one year after leaving government before taking a job with the company.  
The bill would extend the waiting period to two years for contracts worth more than $5 million, after it was amended by the Senate. The bill originally proposed a two-year wait for contracts over $1 million. 
Company that hired state’s former head of economic development benefits from $69 million in aid

Bill sponsor Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, said the amendment was necessary because the state handles many million-dollar contracts, and he did not want the extended wait to apply to routine matters.
The amendment also adds a waiver process allowing a governing body to authorize earlier employment in limited cases, requiring written authorization that becomes a public record and is filed with the state for review. 
Reed filed the bill in response to South Dakota Searchlight reporting about former state economic development commissioner Steve Westra. A year after leaving state government, Westra took a job with CJ Schwan’s. While working for the state, Westra had signed the first pledge of state aid benefiting construction of the company’s $550 million, 650-employee food production plant in northern Sioux Falls. State aid benefiting the project now totals $69 million worth of tax rebates, loans and grants. 
Reed has said repeatedly that Westra followed the law as it stands currently.
“The bill does not allege wrongdoing by any individual in the past,” Reed said Wednesday. 
Reed also said the bill is not meant to slow or second-guess economic development efforts.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EM8A5114-1024x734.jpg,,,2026-01-28 19:56:28.429640

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Washington state Senate voted Wednesday to ban law enforcement from covering their faces in response to growing concerns over masked federal immigration agents. 
Senate Bill 5855 would cover local, state and federal law enforcement, with limited exceptions for uses like personal protective equipment and undercover or SWAT operations. The proposal is sure to face legal hurdles if it becomes law.
Under the legislation, people detained by masked officers could sue them in their official capacity, potentially opening up governments to legal liability.
Democratic senators passed it on a party-line 30-19 vote with no Republican support.
Bill sponsor Sen. Javier Valdez, D-Seattle, said on the Senate floor that every day federal immigration enforcement officers are intimidating and tearing working families apart.
“These masked federal agents are operating without accountability,” he said. 
Democrats turned down three Republican-backed amendments to expand exceptions to the ban. 
The legislation now heads to the House, where leadership doesn’t expect it to reach a floor vote until mid- to late February.
It is a top priority for Democrats this year in the Legislature as they look to protect immigrants from the Trump administration’s increased immigration enforcement. 
This month, for example, masked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents reportedly arrested three people and pulled them into an unmarked van in Seattle, according to The Seattle Times. In an April raid at a Bellingham roofing company, dozens of ICE agents donned masks when they arrested 37 workers accused of being in the country without legal status.
It’s one of the first high-profile bills to pass the Senate this session. If it gets through the House and is signed by the governor, it would go into effect immediately, adding urgency to the legislative process. 
“We must act now to protect our communities, and ensure transparency and accountability,” Valdez said.

Gov. Bob Ferguson has repeatedly expressed support for the measure. 
California was the first state in the nation to pass such a ban last year. It took effect Jan. 1. 
The Trump administration is challenging it in court. It hasn’t yet been ruled on, but in a hearing this month, a judge seemed skeptical of the need for agents to mask. 
“Why can’t they perform their duties without a mask? They did that until 2025, did they not?” U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder said. “How in the world do those who don’t mask manage to operate?”
In a committee hearing on Washington’s bill this month, Pete Serrano, who leads the federal prosecutor’s office in eastern Washington, said the legislation could violate the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause that holds federal statutes “shall be the supreme Law of the Land.” 
Sen. Jeff Holy, R-Cheney, said he couldn’t rebut Valdez’s arguments, but regulating federal agents “is beyond our pay grade.” 
Sen. Leonard Christian, R-Spokane Valley, argued the bill “sends the wrong message” and seems like another way Washington is showing that it doesn’t support law enforcement, referring to the Legislature’s focus on police accountability in recent years.
The Trump administration has argued ICE agents need to wear gaiter-style face coverings to protect their identities amid increased death threats and doxxing. 
“The reason that they are currently wearing masks is they were threatened personally and their families were threatened,” said Sen. Phil Fortunato, R-Auburn.

Sen. Mike Chapman, D-Port Angeles, recalled working as a U.S. Customs inspector in 1999 and catching Ahmed Ressam, who was found guilty of plotting to blow up the Los Angeles International Airport as a member of Al-Qaeda. 
“I’m more proud and more honored to stand here today to say you can do good law enforcement, you can stand for something and having your face known in the world is not something to be afraid of,” he said. 
Supporters see the face covering ban as an extension of a 2021 state law requiring officers be “reasonably identifiable” while on duty. 
The same year, Congress required military members and federal law enforcement to visibly display their name and employer while responding to civil disturbances. The federal law exempts those who don’t wear uniforms while carrying out their duties and those working undercover.
Lawmakers in many other states are considering similar bills to Washington’s. U.S. Senate Democrats on Wednesday called for barring federal immigration enforcement agents from wearing masks, among other reforms, to get their votes to approve government funding and avert a partial federal shutdown. 
The focus on the issue has only grown with the Trump administration’s crackdown in Minnesota. 
Ferguson on Monday painted a grim outlook if Washington were to see a similar ICE deployment. He could see calling up the state National Guard to act as a buffer between protesters and federal authorities, for example. 
The governor is also pushing legislation to stop civilians from falsely identifying themselves as law enforcement officers due to concerns about people impersonating ICE agents. House Bill 2165 would make it a gross misdemeanor to masquerade as police. The legislation passed out of a House committee last week with bipartisan support.

Vermont is not insulated from rising anti-immigrant fear.

A couple of weeks ago, I took the Amtrak Vermonter to Northampton, Mass., gazing out the window as the train wound its way through the snow-covered countryside. 
Our state’s picturesque landscapes usually fill me with joy. However, on this occasion, my idyllic railway reverie was interrupted by a large sign outside a little house. 

READ MORE

It read, “Muslim-free zone.”
I am no stranger to Islamophobia, although since I am not visibly Muslim and do not have an obviously Muslim name, it is not often aimed directly at me. 
But I was unsettled by this sign. It had just been a day since the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an agent of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Jonathan Ross. Since then, another person, Alex Pretti, has been fatally shot.
The ongoing ICE actions in Minnesota have been spurred by xenophobia toward the predominantly Muslim Somali community. 
These events, together with the Trump administration’s actions against every group that does not fit into its vision for the country, swirled around in my head. 
Did the occupant of that little house perhaps apply to be an ICE agent? Who indeed are the people hiding behind the masks?
Friends, comrades, Vermonters — it gives me little pleasure to tell you this, but I am compelled. I believe the worst is yet to come, and yes, it will make its way to our allegedly progressive state. It is only a matter of time.
I bring to your attention National Security Presidential Memorandum 7 (NSPM-7). This is a presidential memorandum that essentially sets the federal government’s priorities. 
NSPM-7 tasks federal law enforcement with pursuing domestic terrorism, but in a way that preempts it. You might ask, how do you preempt an act of terrorism? The memorandum lists a set of criteria to help identify the likelihood of someone committing terrorism. 
Some of these include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, anti-Christianity, extremism on migration, race or gender, and hostility toward those who hold traditional American views on family, religion and morality.
Is one anti-American for opposing war? What is extremism on migration? Believing that migrants should enjoy the same liberties and freedoms as everyone else? 
What is extremism on race? Believing that the descendants of enslaved people should receive reparations? What is extremism on gender? Just being transgender? 
Am I hostile to traditional American views on family simply because I do not believe that the only valid type of family is a heterosexual couple and their children? 
This directive will be used to go after anyone the federal government does not like. In fact, because of it, the federal government is investigating Renee Nicole Good and her partner, a gay couple, rather than the ICE agent who killed her.
So, what is to be done?
I see many of you at protests and rallies. Community and mutual aid organizations, such as Migrant Justice, have come together to protect one another. I am immensely grateful for your presence and action. There is also the Vermont Senate bill S.208, which could bar federal agents from wearing masks. It will likely be legally challenged, but we must fight at every front. 
But to the rest of you, I ask — where are you and what are you doing? 
There is no political opposition fighting for us. Barring a handful of individuals, the national leaders of the Democratic Party are doing next to nothing as Trump’s agents terrify immigrants, grabbing them from the streets, breaking into their homes and racially profiling them — which is now legal according to the U.S. Supreme Court.  
After the immigrants, who is next? 
No one is coming to save us. We must do it ourselves.
It’s important to attend rallies and protests, but it’s not enough. Strategy and structure are paramount. Membership-based organizations offer existing structures and resources. These include workers’ unions and organizations such as the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the largest socialist organization in the country, a prominent member of which is New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani. 
Many people, including myself, have criticisms of DSA; yet it is the only member-driven organization that is large enough to be effective and has an existing structure to work with. 
As someone who studies governance, I know that these structures are immensely difficult and time-consuming to build. Since it is a member-driven organization, you can take advantage of it. 
If you think there is something you want done that is not happening, organize people to make it happen.
Further, we must all engage in political education, learning the history of those who have fought before.
In his Letter from Birmingham Jail, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote: “We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence of the good people.” 
Now is the time to act.

Burlington voters overwhelmingly backed a ban on guns in bars. The legislature should act.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mary Sullivan: Honor Burlington’s vote on guns in bars.","Dear Editor,



Last March, more than 86% of Burlington residents voted to ban guns from bars because of the sensible and simple belief that guns and alcohol do not mix. 
This ordinance change will make our people feel safer while they enjoy everything downtown Burlington has to offer, including our great pedestrian mall and our wonderful restaurants and pubs.
Unfortunately, we’ve yet to see it implemented. 
All charter changes must be approved by the Vermont Legislature before being enacted. S.131 was approved by the Senate last year and now sits in the House Government Operations Committee awaiting action. 
With such a resounding majority, the citizens of Burlington were very clear about what they wanted. The city’s voters believe the passage of this bill will help keep our downtown safer for those who work in and visit Burlington. 
We hope the bill will come to a vote soon and be enacted into law. People who live far from Burlington may not realize how important we believe this charter change is, but it could very well save lives. 
As a board member of GunSenseVT, a former legislator and proud resident of our beautiful city, I find it very frustrating that it isn’t the law already. 
A sign on the Statehouse lawn says weapons are banned from inside the Statehouse. That makes a lot of sense to me. I get a more secure feeling when I’m in the building because of that ban. 
Burlington residents want the same sense of security. 
Vermont communities have the right to set reasonable safety standards for liquor licenses and smoking regulations. We would argue guns are more deadly than these things we already regulate, yet every single change to Vermont gun laws is such a struggle to get through. 
About one-third of people killed in gun homicides in the United States had consumed alcohol before their deaths, and alcohol is common in nonfatal firearm assaults. 
Ben Traverse, chair of the Burlington City Council, said the proposal to ban guns in bars “simply recognizes that mixing alcohol and firearms puts everyone at greater risk” and urged respect for the will of voters who twice approved bans.
This measure is about prevention — acting before a tragedy strikes, not after.
I encourage everyone who believes S.131 needs to pass the House this year to contact their own House members, all members of the House Government Operations Committee and House leadership to tell them the charter change was overwhelmingly supported by the voters of Burlington, and it’s time for them to act.
This charter change is one important step in a broader effort to keep Vermont communities safe. GunSenseVT’s 2026 legislative agenda also calls for banning assault weapons, holding the gun industry accountable and expanding safe-storage education to prevent unintentional shootings and suicides. 
These measures reflect what most Vermonters already believe — that gun safety and gun rights can, and must, coexist.
Mary Sullivan, Burlington, Vt.

The U.S. Department of Justice filed for a stay Tuesday in the lawsuit state Attorney General Liz Murrill filed against the Food and Drug Administration in October in Louisiana’s Western District federal court.
Murrill wants the agency to reverse regulatory action it took in 2023 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, when patient access to physicians was limited. Murrill’s broader intent is to restrict interstate shipments of mifepristone, a medication used to terminate pregnancies but that also has other life-saving and gynecological uses.
Under pressure from anti-abortion groups, FDA Administrator Marty Makary began a review of mifepristone’s safety in September through what the agency calls its Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS. Reproductive health advocates have said the review isn’t needed based on decades of the drug being used safely without a significant history of complications.
“Given this widespread debate over the safety of mifepristone, FDA has concluded that the best path forward is for the agency to reconsider the restrictions on mifepristone based on all the evidence before the agency,” Assistant U.S. Attorney General Brett Shumate wrote in the stay request for the Louisiana case.
His filing also said Louisiana doesn’t have standing to sue the Food and Drug Administration because it cannot supplant federal authority, among other reasons. If the court were to accept Louisiana’s arguments, it would likely lead states to challenge any federal action they claim could increase crime or place more burden on state authorities to enforce. 
“States could challenge the loosening of federal regulations relating to firearms, the environment, banking, or anything else, Shumate’s filing said.

In a social media post Tuesday, Murrill took issue with the stay request and referenced her attempts to prosecute doctors in California and New York who have been indicted in Louisiana for prescribing abortion medication and shipping it to the state. Governors in both states have rejected Murrill’s attempts to extradite the doctors in question, leaning on the shield laws in their respective states that protect medical providers.
Murrill has said the availability of abortion medication has led to more pregnancies being terminated in Louisiana than before the U.S. Supreme Court decided in June 2022 to reverse its landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade, allowing states to ban abortion. 
“The U.S. Food and Drug Administration admits that the REMS is flawed but claims that Louisiana can’t sue to stop the 1,000 dangerous abortions a month in Louisiana that the REMS allows. That is an affront to our sovereignty and the dignity of women and the unborn,” Murrill said. “FDA should stand with us for life, not with Gavin Newsom or Kathy Hochul.” 
Advocates for self-managed abortions back Murrill’s monthly abortion count claim, saying the study it’s based on is likely an undercount because patients and physicians are reluctant to report actual data in states where abortion is banned.
Murrill’s federal case is on behalf of Rosalie Markezich, a St. Tammany Parish woman who said her boyfriend coerced her into taking mifepristone he obtained in October 2023 from a California doctor. 
The attorney general issued an arrest warrant last year for the physician, Dr. Remy Coeytaux, before obtaining an indictment against him earlier this month. 
Murrill has also charged Dr. Margaret Carpenter, the New York doctor who she said shipped abortion drugs to a West Baton Rouge woman for her pregnant minor daughter. The physician and the girl’s mother were indicted a year ago for allegedly violating a 2022 state law that makes it a crime to knowingly cause an abortion through medication.

(Photo courtesy of Des Moines Public Schools)Months after the federal immigration arrest of former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts, an Iowa Senate subcommittee advanced legislation Wednesday to bolster verification steps in educational credentialing and hiring processes to ensure a person is lawfully eligible to work and live in the U.S.
Senate Study Bill 3015 would require the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners to require all applicants for new and renewing licenses to provide information about their lawful presence in the country. Education professionals who do not have license renewal requirements are required to submit evidence of their ability to stay and work in the U.S. to the BOEE every five years in order to remain licensed.
Additionally, public school boards, those overseeing charter schools and innovation zone schools and authorities in charge of nonpublic schools would be required to verify the identity and employment eligibility of all individuals who accept a job offer at their institution.

The measure is responding to the immigration arrest of former DMPS superintendent Ian Roberts. Roberts, a citizen of Guyana according to court records, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in September during a “targeted enforcement operation.” He had been given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024 and faced previous criminal charges, according to U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports.
Both the Des Moines school district and Iowa state government have faced criticism for failing to identify Roberts’ immigration status and employment eligibility. The superintendent was hired by DMPS in 2023, and had his administrator license approved by the state regulatory agency in July 2023.
The Des Moines school board is suing JG Consulting, the firm contracted in its superintendent search, which led to Roberts’ hire, as his immigration status and previous criminal charges were not flagged. Iowa Auditor Rob Sand also received a request in October to audit the Iowa Department of Education and state BOEE in relation to Roberts’ licensing.
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued an executive order in October requiring state government departments to use the federal E-Verify and Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database to verify immigration and work statuses of people seeking state jobs as well as state occupational and professional licenses.
The bill discussed Wednesday would not codify this executive order, Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, said, but takes language already existing in Iowa Code and “enhances” it by making certain verification processes required instead of optional. He said that enacting the bill could mean the BOEE and school districts use services like E-Verify and SAVE for verification processes, but other systems could be used in the future.
“When working on drafting this bill, we intentionally did not name a product … as either potentially better products or better data systems become available, we want Iowa Code to be prepared to allow for those as well,” Evans said.
Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, said she had questions on the use of E-Verify in this process, as the system has resulted in “false positives,” incorrectly labeling some people as being in the country unlawfully.
“That concerns me because there’s no appeal process in the bill if in fact they are misidentified,” Winckler said.
Emily Piper, representing the Iowa Association of School Boards, said the organization is concerned about the specific language used in the bill, saying “there is a distinct difference between ‘lawfully present’ and ‘authorized to work.'” Refugees, for example, may be legally present in the U.S. but not have a work authorization. At the same time, there are foreign teachers who are not “lawfully present” in the U.S. but are authorized to work through state partnerships, Piper said, pointing to an Iowa Department of Education partnership with some universities in Spain that allows teachers from Spain to teach Spanish in Iowa schools through an exchange program.
She said the group’s recommendation would be to change the language to focus on work authorization, which she said was the issue at hand.
“You can’t be authorized to work if you aren’t legal to be here, but we do have out-of-country folks who do have that authorization,” Piper said.
Other lobbyists with education organizations echoed Piper’s comments, calling for clarification of the language. Evans told reporters it is “worth looking into” this language change to ensure the bill has its intended effect.
Separate immigration bills advance
There were two other measures related to immigration that advanced through subcommittee meetings Wednesday. Immigrants and advocates with the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice spoke against House Study Bill 552, a bill that would ban cities and counties from issuing local identification cards to residents. The measure allows local governments to issue employee IDs, and also allows authorized counties to issue forms of ID like driver’s licenses, nonoperator’s identification cards and identification devices for persons with disabilities.
Johnson County’s community ID program is one of the main initiatives in Iowa that would be affected by this measure. The community identification card cannot be used to vote, get a driver’s license, board an airplane or purchase alcohol or tobacco. But supporters of the Johnson County program said it plays an important role in many people’s lives, as they use the local ID when interacting with schools, law enforcement and local government agencies.
Another Iowa Senate subcommittee advanced Senate Study Bill 3045 Wednesday, a bill requiring county auditors to use the SAVE database to verify the U.S. citizenship and voter eligibility of people registering to vote. If a person’s citizenship status cannot be confirmed, the individual cannot be registered to vote — but they are allowed to appeal the decision to the district court.

Law enforcement in June said a man killed two firefighters and critically injured another who were trying to battle a brush fire in Coeur d’Alene. The firefighters killed were Battalion Chief John Morrison, of the Coeur d’Alene Fire Department, and Battalion Chief Frank Harwood, of Kootenai County Fire and Rescue.

Sam Creekmore, R-New Albany, discusses his disappointment that the state Senate conferees did not attend a meeting to discuss their updated legislative plans for the cost of Mississippi Medicaid expansion during a public legislative conference committee meeting at the Mississippi State Capitol on Thursday, April 25, 2024.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Cellphones could soon become a rarer sight in classrooms, thanks to the Mississippi Legislature.
The House Education Committee passed a bill during their Wednesday meeting that would require local school boards to enact policies that restrict or prohibit the use of cellphones during the school day. The Senate Education Committee greenlit a similar bill during their meeting last week, which bodes well for the legislative success of the policy. 
Rep. Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, said similar bills have previously failed, but he’s optimistic that the Legislature can get the policy passed this year because it’s a priority for legislators in both chambers. Creekmore also said he’s concerned about the amount of time students are spending on their phones and how that impacts their mental health. 
Mental health issues among teenagers have risen sharply since the early 2010s, coinciding with the widespread adoption of smartphones.
“You just can’t ignore that,” he said. 
Youth mental health concerns have sparked renewed interest in policies across the country. Research links cellphone and social media usage among school-aged kids to negative mental health outcomes and instances of cyberbullying.
At least 33 states and the District of Columbia require school districts to ban or restrict students from using cellphones in schools, according to Education Week. A measure that would have done so in Mississippi died last session, even after Mississippi’s youth mental health task force recommended that all school districts implement policies that limited cellphone and social media usage in classrooms.
Still, districts have established their own policies — and seen the dividends. Creekmore cited the success of a new school cellphone policy in Marshall County as an example, near his district. In 2024, Marshall County School District in Holly Springs became the first district in north Mississippi to restrict students’ use of cellphones in school. Upon arrival at school, students store their phones in lockable pouches, which blocks access during class. 
After implementing the policy, 88% of teachers in Marshall County schools saw an improvement in student engagement, according to the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal.
Jackson Public Schools established a stricter cellphone policy this past school year, requiring students to keep their phones out of sight and off their person during school.
Since updating the policy, district spokesman Sherwin Johnson said teachers report improved classroom management, better transitions between classes and more meaningful teacher-student interactions across schools.
He also said that students are less distracted and more engaged, and there have been fewer discipline infractions tied to cellphone misuse during class. 
“This policy is not about eliminating technology, but about establishing appropriate boundaries that prioritize learning,” Johnson said in an emailed statement. “By creating structured, distraction-free environments, we are reinforcing a culture of accountability, respect, and academic focus that keeps classrooms focused on instruction, collaboration, and scholar success.”
That tracks with research in other states.

One study in Florida, which became the first state to institute a statewide school cellphone restriction in 2023, found that student test scores rose in schools with previously high cellphone usage two years after the ban and attendance improved. An initial increase in disciplinary incidents was likely due to cellphone infractions during that transitional year, said David Figlio, an economics professor at the University of Rochester and one of the study’s authors.
“The school district permitted them to have phones in their backpacks or pocket, so it stands to reason that when there’s a temptation nearby, people might succumb to that temptation,” Figlio said. “When my phone is buzzing, even when I’m teaching, I feel this visceral need to check it out. Imagine you’re 14.”
Still, Jackson parents initially pushed back during community listening sessions about the cellphone policy this summer, citing anxiety about losing contact with students during an emergency. 
A Pew Research Center survey found that most adults support cellphone bans in middle and high school classes, but those who don’t say it’s because their child can use their phone during emergencies.
Creekmore said he’s raised similar concerns to law enforcement, who say having a cellphone during an emergency could be distracting.
Brigette Whaley, a professor at West Texas A&M University and former middle school teacher, has studied classroom cellphone policies in several states. She found that at one rural high school in Texas during the 2024-25 school year, a bell-to-bell phone-free policy resulted in more student engagement, less “drama” among students and less student anxiety and cyberbullying. 
“What I’m seeing with teachers is that they’re definitely excited about building those relationships and community in their classrooms again,” she said. 
While she understands parents’ desire to stay in touch with their children, Whaley urged them to trust their schools to have policies in place to contact students through the school’s administrative offices. 
“School is a place that should be safe and is for learning,” she said. “Students also need the opportunity to spread their wings a little bit, and this gives them the opportunity to be a little more independent in what should be a safe environment in schools.”
And as people continue to study the impact of the bans, Whaley believes researchers will find that violence at schools will decrease, too. 
“I’m hoping to see that trend down as students begin reengaging in their classrooms and have those face-to-face human relationships that have been going downhill for years now,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/05195715/3X0A8368-copy-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-28 18:57:32.749026

Maura Healey’s new state budget proposal, roughly twice as much as all other state spending in a reflection of the challenge Beacon Hill faces to control health care costs.","HEALEY BUDGET CHIEF Matt Gorzkowicz had a split-second answer ready to go Wednesday when, after detailing the governor’s sweeping annual budget bill, a reporter asked what he expects to be the biggest fiscal-management challenge in the year ahead.
Health care costs, he replied almost immediately, a fitting choice as the state stares down the prospect of sharply rising Medicaid needs and an expected decline in federal funding that would otherwise ease the burden.
As is typically the case, the state’s Medicaid program,MassHealth, figures to be the single largest area of spending in the fiscal year 2027 budget proposal Healey unveiled Wednesday, accounting for $22.7 billion of the roughly $63.4 billion bottom line.
After federal reimbursements, budget-writers expect a net cost to the state of $9.3 billion, about 7.4 percent more than last year. That’s roughly twice the rate of overall spending growth in Healey’s annual budget, even after accounting for attempts to rein in the trend with targeted cuts.
Healey’s plan would cap dental benefits for adult MassHealth members at $1,000 per year and reduce funding for care management. She’ll also instruct MassHealth to take administrative steps to end coverage of GLP-1 drugs when used only for weight loss.
Taken together, those three steps would save $311 million in total MassHealth spending, or $110 million after accounting for federal reimbursements, according to Healey’s budget office.
Healey said her team looked for “places we can shave a little because we don’t have a choice.” Without those maneuvers and several other one-time fixes, she said, MassHealth spending would have increased by a double-digit percentage.
“Faced with an array of bad decisions, we tried to make the very best decisions that took care of the people that needed most to be taken care of,” she said.
MassHealth faces many of the same pressures plaguing commercial insurers, such as steep cost growth for prescription drugs. The state’s Medicaid system does not, however, expect increased headcount to play a role this year: Officials estimate MassHealth enrollment will stay flat or drop a bit in fiscal year 2027. Nearly 2 million people are covered by the program, a state-federal partnership that provides health insurance to low-income residents.  
Healey’s team stressed that harder times are on the horizon as Massachusetts braces for the impacts of the federal reconciliation package President Trump signed in July. The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation projected last year that the law’s suite of health care changes, including new work requirements for Medicaid, will collectively shrink federal funding to Massachusetts by more than $24 billion over the next decade.
The governor kicked off her budget-unveiling press conference by lamenting that Trump “has taken a hatchet to federal funding.”
“We were looking at having to spend so much more money to try to deal with what was happening” to health care funding, Healey said. “But I said to the team, ‘We can’t let that happen. We can’t bankrupt our state while we try to address the federal shortfalls.’”
Altogether, including money from the voter-approved surtax on high earners that can only go toward education and transportation, Healey’s fiscal year 2027 annual budget would increase spending 3.8 percent over the fiscal year 2026 version.
That’s a smaller increase than the 5.4 percent jump from fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2026, but still higher than inflation and the 2.9 percent growth Beacon Hill expects for tax collections.
Healey, who last week made official her reelection campaign with affordability as a central theme, sought to spin the budget proposal as significantly more modest. She compared its bottom line not to the corollary annual budget she signed last summer, but instead to the state’s total spending in fiscal year 2026, a figure that includes the annual budget plus other “supplemental” budgets that collectively add hundreds of millions of dollars to the tab.
Doug Howgate, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation think tank, credited the administration for “turning the ship” of spending growth following bigger annual increases in prior years. But he still warned about the long-term impacts of a structural mismatch between what the state brings in and what it appropriates.
“The real question is going to be when we do start to see some of those federal impacts on Medicaid enrollment and things like that,” he said. “If that happens, when the economy turns, it just ratchets up the pressure on the budget, and you want to make sure we’re in a place where we can adapt.”
Healey deputies said her annual budget bill does not seek any new tax or fee increases. (That means no renewed attempt to apply the state’s sales tax to candy sales, something Healey unsuccessfully floated a year ago.)
The governor on Wednesday also filed a separate bill that would carve up about $1.15 billion in revenue collected, but not yet spent, from the voter-approved surtax on wealthy households.
Healey’s spending plans would look dramatically different without the millionaires tax, revenue from which plays a critical role in several long-term goals under the governor’s latest proposals.
Her two spending bills together would direct more than $1.1 billion in surtax revenue toward the MBTA to cover its operations and replenish its reserves. Officials said that infusion would be enough to close the transit agency’s projected deficit in fiscal year 2027 and address most of its expected shortfall the following year.
Healey also called for using $550 million in surtax revenue to pay for increases in Chapter 70 state aid, which helps cities and towns pay for K-12 education, required under the 2019 funding reform law known as the Student Opportunity Act. She said the investment would guarantee a minimum increase in per-pupil aid of $75 for districts.
Her bill would increase Chapter 70 funding by $241 million overall, so all of the increase and more than $300 million of the base level set this year would be, arguably, fueled by the surtax.
That may rankle the unions who led the multi-year political push for the surtax. During the campaign, they argued that the new funding should only be used on top of recurring, operating dollars, not to replace them.
The fiscal year 2026 state budget used $496 million in surtax to pay for the entirety of that year’s annual step-up in school aid required by the Student Opportunity Act, prompting raised eyebrows. Massachusetts Teachers Association president Max Page told State House News Service at the time that he hoped such a significant an amount of surtax dollars going toward the Student Opportunity Act “wouldn’t be a part of next year’s budget.”
Healey’s surtax surplus spending plan is not the only fiscal proposal intertwined with her annual budget.
Earlier this month, she quietly filed legislation that would delay implementation of some of the tax-code changes enacted by the federal reconciliation law, which are projected to cut hundreds of millions of dollars from the state’s tax haul. Healey argued that phasing in those measures would soften the immediate financial impacts on Beacon Hill by $440 million over two years, while still allowing businesses to enjoy the relief down the line.
Officials said Wednesday that her annual budget’s math assumes the Legislature will approve her bill, which is no certainty given that lawmakers have been mostly quiet about whether or how they want to respond to the tax changes.
The governor’s annual budget filing is only a starting point for debate. Lawmakers will hold a series of hearings over the next few months to unpack it. The House typically rolls out and approves its budget rewrite in April, followed by the Senate in May.
Legislators then need to reconcile differences in their approach to get a final bill to Healey — a task they almost never complete before the July 1 start of the fiscal year that the budget covers.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01-28_Healey_budget_presser_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-28 18:57:32.749026

Rutland Regional Medical Center said it has already seen a reduction in blood delivery while other Vermont hospitals are waiting to feel the effect.

The recent winter storm and extreme cold have worsened an already severe shortage of donated blood, according to the American Red Cross’s Northern New England Region. 
On Monday, following a winter storm that dumped up to 20 inches of snow across Vermont, the Red Cross canceled its blood drives in the state, forgoing the collection of 47 units of blood, according to Jennifer Costa, the New England region’s communications director for the organization.
“The need for blood does not stop for Mother Nature, but if it is unsafe for staff or donors to get there, we will cancel a drive,” Costa said.

That cancellation compounded an existing national shortage. On Jan. 20, the organization reported a 35% drop in its blood supply throughout January, compared to a month earlier.
Some Vermont hospitals are beginning to see the downstream effects of this reduction. Saisha Branchaud, who directs Rutland Regional Medical Center’s pharmacy operations, said the hospital started to experience the shortage Wednesday, when a shipment of platelets the hospital had been expecting did not arrive.
When that happens, the medical center must find other ways to manage patients in need of platelet transfusion, which often includes transferring them to other hospitals. Platelets, which are a part of the blood, are essential to stop bleeding and are often given to patients who have autoimmune issues, cancers or other factors that prevent them from clotting. 
If all hospitals in a region experience the same blood shortages, “a decision would need to be made about who we need to save these platelets for,” Branchaud said.
Hospitals in the UVM Health network, which includes the flagship medical center in Burlington, Porter Hospital in Middlebury and Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin, have not yet seen impacts of the shortage, according to network spokesperson Phillip Rau. However, the hospitals “​are aware of and monitoring the situation,” he wrote in an email.
Rau added that a broader decline of blood donors has meant the “hospitals and health systems have become very adept at managing blood supplies and ensuring patients don’t see negative impacts, like changes in scheduled procedures, treatments or care.” 
Nearly all of Vermont’s hospitals are reliant on the Red Cross for blood, since none have the on-sight facilities needed to process donated blood. Dartmouth Health, across the border in Lebanon, New Hampshire, does have these capabilities, and its Vermont partner hospitals receive blood through Dartmouth.
Some winter dips in blood supply are typical, as the holiday season curbs some donations, but this year’s particularly virulent flu season and winter storms have led to a more drastic dip in the number of donors, Branchaud and Costa explained.
With a shelf life of 42 days, blood is fairly easy to move around regions based on need. Usually, Vermonters’ relative resilience to winter weather allows the state to emerge as a source of donated blood for other regions when they are slammed by storms, Costa said. However, this most recent storm affected such a vast stretch of the country that the shortage spans nationally. Nationwide, the Red Cross needed to cancel nearly 500 blood drives, according to a release. 
Though this year’s shortage is more pronounced, it fits into a larger pattern of declining donations, attributed to both climatic emergencies and a changing culture. Costa said the number of people giving blood to the Red Cross nationally has dropped by 300,000 since 2019, which she attributed to a shift toward remote work and away from communal congregating. The number of Red Cross blood donors has dropped from 3.7 million in 2003 to 2.1 million in 2022, Costa added.
In both January 2024 and 2022, the Red Cross experienced critically low blood donation levels, she said. In January 2024, Vermont had to forgo 28 units of blood — this January’s shortage is nearly double that. 
The Red Cross’s Northern New England branch is now urging Vermonters to help the deficit in supply. 
“There are very real world consequences to a shortage, and without blood, hospitals are going to have to make very difficult decisions that nobody wants to make,” Costa said.

“Market style regulation always fails rural people,” said Rep. Laura Sibilia, pointing to complaints from constituents and concerns over emergency communications.

Talks between lawmakers and business leaders grew fractious Wednesday morning as the House Energy and Digital Infrastructure Committee considered a bill intended to strengthen consumer protections for fiber optic utilities, particularly in rural areas. 
Sarah Davis, of Fidium Fiber, told the committee that such a bill was not only unnecessary but also improper under federal law.
“This is an area where the FCC … has chosen to regulate, and so it is not appropriate for the states to create their own legislation,” Davis said.
“That’s not my understanding, or what (we’ve) heard from (legislative) counsel,” said Rep. Laura Sibilia, I-Dover.
The committee bill specifically seeks to ease customers’ transitions from older copper wire technology to the state’s fiber optic network, which has expanded in recent years with hundreds of millions in federal investment. In its current form, the bill would require more frequent and more comprehensive communication than federal rules mandate between providers and customers during such a changeover, lawmakers said.
Sibilia said in an interview Wednesday that she’d received three separate calls from constituents complaining about service issues related to this type of transition. She is particularly concerned about those in rural areas, where infrastructure might be more fragile, and alternative providers more scarce, she added. 
“Market style regulation always fails rural people,” she said.
Emergency communications are also among the legislation’s chief priorities, Sibilia said. 
“The problem that I think we’re trying to solve,” Sibilia told the committee, is “who can call 911, and when, and who might have problems?”
Unlike some traditional landlines, phones that use the internet require electricity to function. Several provisions in the bill seek more information from companies about customers’ use of battery backup services for fiber telephones, a technology designed to prevent users from becoming isolated in a power outage.
Kimberly Gates, of the Franklin Telephone Company, cautioned the committee that some parts of the bill remain technically vague or incomplete, for example overlooking situations in which battery backups would not be necessary, or would not work.
Committee chair Rep. Kathleen James, D-Manchester, confirmed the committee will move ahead to a vote on the bill. While some adjustments may be necessary, she said, she has little doubt of the Legislature’s legal authority to implement protections in this case.

A coalition of advocacy organizations calling themselves Fair Share Vermont — Public Assets Institute, ACLU of Vermont, AFT Vermont, the Vermont-NEA, Rural Vermont and more — called on the state to raise taxes on the highest income earners in response to new tax breaks for the rich passed by Congress. 
In total, the top 20% of income earners in Vermont are set to receive more than $730 million in tax breaks in 2026, according to Fair Share. 
The average net cash income per farm is about $47,000 annually, according to Graham Unangst-Rufenacht, policy director at Rural Vermont. Yet the top 1% of income earners in the state are expected to receive an average annual tax break of $57,000, he said.
“We are losing farms. We are losing farmland. People cannot afford health care. They are losing essential services,” he said. 
Fair Share has coalesced around a series of bills that would look to raise taxes on the wealthy, including H.619, H.620 and H.621.

Gov. Phil Scott said Wednesday that if the Trump administration does not commit to getting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to “change their ways,” he thinks U.S. senators should reject the federal Homeland Security appropriations bill they are considering this week that would direct about $10 billion to ICE for the upcoming year. 
“I believe there’s a significant amount of training that needs to happen,” the Republican governor said of the agency. He was speaking to reporters at his weekly press conference.  “They’ve expanded their team over the last few months, and I don’t think they’ve had the proper training to deal with the general public.”
Vermont’s three members of Congress have all said they won’t vote for the Homeland Security funding legislation after federal immigration agents shot and killed two people in Minneapolis. If enough Senate Democrats don’t back the appropriations bill — and the legislation in that chamber remains tied to other federal spending measures, as Republicans want it now — the federal government could shut down at the end of the week.

A panel that evaluates racial disparities in the criminal legal system wants to do more work. 
“The group, being a bunch of passionate nerds, would like to meet more often,” said Xusana Davis, the state’s executive director of racial equity, who chairs the panel. 
The panel also wants lawmakers to start evaluating the racial inequities of proposed legislation. Davis told senators in the Judiciary Committee that other states like New Jersey and Colorado require all bills under consideration in their capitals to be evaluated for potentially disproportionate effects on different citizens. 
It would create more government accountability, Davis said, to dig into the potential inequities in legislation before it’s passed, rather than trying to correct course after the fact.

A U.S. Coast Guard aircraft flew low enough over the Statehouse Wednesday afternoon to rattle a number of ears in the building, according to the Capitol Police Department. The plane was en route to Burlington, though officers weren’t sure whether that was its final destination.
“This was not expected and given the proximity to the State House, was alarming,” Sergeant-at-Arms Agatha Kessler wrote in an email to legislators and their staff later on Wednesday, which was viewed by VTDigger.
Capitol Police told VTDigger that while they might have preferred the aircraft fly a little higher, it never presented a threat to anyone’s safety.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota House of Representatives overwhelmingly supported a bill Wednesday to recognize tribal officers as law enforcement officers under state law, but some members balked at a resolution urging a tribal law enforcement training academy before adopting it.
Tribal officers frequently offer mutual aid to state, county and city officers when asked, but are not extended the same legal protections extended to the officers they aid. If a tribal officer is assaulted while providing aid away from tribal land, the perpetrator can’t be charged with the felony state crime of assaulting a law enforcement officer.
House Bill 1007 came from the State-Tribal Relations Committee and is sponsored by Rep. Eric Emery, a Democrat from Rosebud and a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. If passed and signed by the governor, legal protections would be extended to “any officer, prosecutor, or employee of an Indian tribe who is assisting or aiding in” the enforcement of state criminal or highway laws.
The House passed the bill 67-0, sending it to the Senate.
A resolution tied to tribal policing didn’t get quite such clear support. 
House Concurrent Resolution 6001 would signal the Legislature’s support for locating a federal tribal law enforcement academy in South Dakota. Currently, most tribal officers are expected to attend basic law enforcement training at a federal Bureau of Indian Affairs facility in Artesia, New Mexico.
Meeting between lawmakers, tribal officials points to potential for more cooperation in policing

U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, has called on the federal government to establish a tribal police training facility for the Great Plains and locate it in Pierre, in hopes of making it easier to recruit officers to work for one of the nine tribes in South Dakota.
Some consternation followed the addition of an amendment specifying that the resolution doesn’t support such a BIA training facility being used to train officers for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, being used as an ICE detention facility, or the establishment of any memoranda of understanding between ICE and any South Dakota tribe.
The amendment was made by the House Judiciary Committee on Friday.
Emery was also the resolution’s sponsor. Rep. Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, asked Emery where the amendment came from. Emery said it was added at the request of tribal officials.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs is not part of the Department of Homeland Security, but recruits from several federal agencies — including BIA and Border Patrol — train in Artesia.
“Because of that connection with Homeland Security and ICE, they just wanted to clearly lay out that there’s a separation between the two,” Emery said.
Some tribes in South Dakota have issued statements critical of ICE since the federal agency’s operations ramped up in Minneapolis earlier this year. This week, the Yankton Sioux Tribe’s Business and Claims Committee passed a resolution to “ban ICE on the reservation to protect our tribal citizens from dangerous enforcement activities.”
Back at the Capitol, Odenbach said he was troubled by the language excluding ICE.
“My preference would frankly be the opposite,” said Odenbach, a member of the State-Tribal Relations Committee who endorsed the concept of the resolution last fall.
Rep. Peri Pourier, R-Rapid City, a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, urged her colleagues to support the nonbinding resolution, saying that tribal governments are sovereign nations and want to make sure that their longstanding support of training for tribal officers wouldn’t be interpreted as support for ICE immigration enforcement.
State, local or tribal governments can enter into agreements with ICE. Some South Dakota agencies have signed such agreements. 
“The reason why this is being clarified is because the tribes have a right to go into those agreements or not,” Pourier said.
The resolution passed 49-18.

Ryan Zinke, who co-chairs the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, was instrumental in passing a vote which overturned a minerals ban on roughly 255,500 acres of National Forest land, paving the way for future mining operations just miles from the popular Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

(Courtesy photo)U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, who co-chairs the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus, was instrumental in passing a vote which overturned a minerals ban on roughly 255,500 acres of National Forest land, paving the way for future mining operations just miles from the popular Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.
In a tense debate last Wednesday, Zinke said copper and rare-earth metal mining operations are essential to national security, and are environmentally sound. But conservation groups say Zinke formed the caucus to “advance policies for the conservation of and public access to public lands,” and his actions last week are at odds with that mission and call into question his stance on public lands.
Montana’s other congressman, Rep. Troy Downing, also voted to overturn the ban, and the resolution is pending approval by the Senate. But the vote showed a fracture has formed in the caucus even as it’s just getting off the ground.
In House Joint Resolution 140, the House used the Congressional Review Act to reverse a public lands order issued by the previous administration — the same method used to overturn a ban on new coal leasing across eastern Montana. 
Leading up to the vote, multiple public lands and sporting groups advocated against the legislation, brought by Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber. Among those in the crosshairs of lobbyists were some of the chamber’s moderate members, including those involved in the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus co-founded by Zinke. 
In an editorial that ran in several Lee Newspapers before the vote, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers CEO Ryan Callaghan and Steven Rinella of Meateater said the vote was a “​​defining moment and a test of leadership,” and specifically called on the bipartisan House Public Lands Caucus to take a stance. 
“Created last year to make sure our public lands and waters are shielded from dangerous ideas in Congress, HJR 140 is exactly the type of proposal caucus members must work together to strike down,” they wrote. “Republicans and Democrats pushing in the same direction can protect our outdoor heritage by making sure that our wildest places, like the Boundary Waters, remain in public hands.”
Instead, the Public Lands Caucus split along party lines, with co-chair Zinke whipping votes in support of Stauber’s proposal, according to E&E News, in opposition of Democratic co-chair Rep. Gabe Vazquez. 
Downing is also a member of the Public Lands Caucus and voted with Zinke.
The bill passed 214-208 on nearly party lines, with one Democrat and one Republican voting against the rest of their respective party.

The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is the nation’s most-visited wilderness area, comprising just over a million acres along the Canadian border and adjacent to two provincial parks and Voyageurs National Park. 
The 20-year withdrawal from federal mineral leasing on nearby land within the Superior National Forest was originally put forward by the Obama administration, but the process was halted during the first Trump presidency while Zinke was serving as Interior Secretary. 
The current moratorium instated by the Biden Administration took effect in January 2023 and was praised by numerous outdoor advocate groups, including the Teddy Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Trout Unlimited and BHA. In its environmental study of the proposal, the U.S. Forest Service concluded that hardrock minerals mining posed significant risk to the Boundary Waters ecosystem. 
“The requested withdrawal is needed because the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management have seen and can reasonably anticipate increasing interest within the private sector for developing the copper-nickel ore minerals in the Duluth Complex that may adversely impact the Rainy River watershed,” according to the assessment. 
More than 250,000 public comments were submitted about the proposal, with a vast majority in favor of a ban. 
In addition, the Biden administration canceled two hardrock mineral leases held by Twin Metals Minnesota, a subsidiary of Chilean-based Antofagasta, which has been working to develop mining projects in the region for more than 15 years. 
Twin Metals calls their project near the Boundary Waters a “world-class, 21st century” underground mine that would produce copper, nickel, cobalt and platinum group metals — utilized in medical, industrial and automotive products as well as in the renewable energy sector. 
According to the company’s scoping assessment for the mine, it would process 20,000 tons of ore per day.
On the House Floor last Wednesday, Zinke spoke in favor of reopening the area to mining to ensure America has a domestic supply of strategic metals, used for many military applications, urged his colleagues to “follow the science, not the hype,” and cited his time as Secretary when he reviewed Twin Metals’ proposal. 
“I think probably I stand on the conservation side as much as any member. But I’ve actually read the mining plans. I have a degree in geology and look closely at it and you know what? There are good projects and there’s bad projects and we don’t mine like we used to,” Zinke said, urging his colleagues to support the measure. “When a mine is not located in the wilderness, is not located in the buffer, it’s located in a Forest Service holding, which by nature, by law, is multiple use. And mining is an appropriate use.”
But Rep. Jared Huffman, D-California, the Ranking Member of the House Natural Resources Committee, pushed back, saying copper mines similar to the one Twin Metals proposed have a history of polluting nearby environments. 
He also cast doubt over Zinke’s scrutiny of the company’s proposal.
“I appreciate that the gentleman from Montana is suddenly so forthcoming about all of the analysis that’s gone into this particular mining project, because that wasn’t always the case when he was Secretary,” Huffman said. “We asked to see that analysis, and what we got back was page after page of redaction. We got zero information.”
Antofagasta Minerals, the mining company with interests in northern Minnesota, was recently fined by Chile’s environmental regulator for failing to comply with water management regulations at one of its copper mines. 
Public lands groups were swift to criticize the House vote, with some taking a direct aim at Zinke. 
Callaghan, of BHA, said in a statement to Field & Stream that “it’s disappointing that our House members can’t connect the dots between the benefits of the wild places in their own backyards and the Boundary Waters of northern Minnesota.”
Zinke’s team did not respond to questions from the Daily Montanan about his work to get the legislation passed, and the difference in his stance on proposed Montana mining operations compared to his vote on the Minnesota legislation did not receive a response. 
Earlier this year, Montana’s congressional delegation, including Zinke, weighed in on a mining exploration project near the headwaters of the Bitterroot River that was on the federal fast-track list and drew extensive public opposition. 
“Fast tracking a mine with overwhelming public opposition and bypassing the mechanisms that allow for transparency and accountability is the wrong way to do it,” Zinke said in a statement.
Zinke’s chief of staff, Heather Swift, told E&E news that Zinke has always been clear about his support for projects like the Minnesota mines. 

“The mine is a good project with a strong safety plan and the palladium group metals that will be mined there are critical for national security, green energy, and tech security,” Swift said.
Mining companies and industry groups say that having a robust supply of key metals and minerals is beneficial to the U.S., as opposed to having to import them from countries with lax environmental and worker regulations, and the Trump administration has pushed to increase domestic opportunities. 
“Currently, China and other adversarial nations dominate the globe in critical mineral production and processing, while U.S. dependence on foreign sources for these materials has recently reached an all-time high,” wrote a coalition of industry groups to Congressional leaders supporting the CRA vote. “Congress now has the opportunity to correct a detrimental action that ran contrary to our national interest, and to do so assures that these minerals will be produced domestically according to some of the world’s most rigorous environmental standards.”

Lawmakers expressed concerns Wednesday over the process for how people in prison receive rehabilitation services, especially substance abuse. (File)Legislators told an Alabama Department of Corrections official Wednesday that they were concerned by reports that inmates were not getting access to rehabilitation programs in a timely manner.
Members of the Joint Prison Oversight Committee told M. Stanford Robinson, who oversees education, programs and reentry for ADOC, on Wednesday, that those delays were keeping people in prison for longer times or leading to inmates being released without receiving court-ordered treatment.
“Some people are saying, ‘I would rather be sentenced to two or three years on a split sentence instead of a split with substance abuse training because I do not know if I would ever get out of substance abuse training because I do not know if I would ever get into substance abuse training,’” said Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, in an interview after the meeting.

Hundreds of individuals, many with friends and loved ones incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons attended the meeting, filling the committee room and two adjacent ones. Several expressed dismay at the answers Robinson offered at the dais.
The comments from legislators came during an hour-long presentation by Robinson and Jeffrey Williams, deputy commissioner for government relations, on prison programming, including substance abuse treatment and employment programs, from sewing to making furniture, and courses available to inmates through Ingram State Technical College.
Much of the discussion centered on the substance abuse services offered by ADOC and overdose deaths in Alabama’s prisons. At one point, Robinson told the members that people are first evaluated before they are assigned to specific programs.
“What you just said bothers me,” said Rep. Jim Hill, R-Odenville, a retired judge and chair of the House Judiciary Committee. “I have spent 20 years putting people in prison. Many times, I will order the person into a program in the prison system.”
Hill said he would split sentences to require that people he sent to prison receive treatment for substance abuse. But Hill said he also received calls from corrections officials resisting a person’s enrollment in a program.
“That is not your job,” Hill told Robinson. “When a judge orders someone into a program, I assure you we expect that person to go to that program; not an evaluation to decide whether or not we have made a decision that is required.”
Williams said the department prioritized those ordered into treatment programs.
“What we tend to do is sometimes we have to move an individual to a facility where there may be space,” Williams told the committee. “We do a lot of juggling around with individuals, and sometimes that may be the case.”
Some people who attended the meeting criticized the DOC presentation. Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, a nonprofit that focuses on criminal justice reform, said she was “very disappointed” in the presentation, citing the ongoing staffing shortages at ADOC.
Several people incarcerated won lawsuits because they could not get adequate medical and mental health treatment in the facilities.
There are pockets of places that provide good programming but there are not enough, according to Crowder.
There were just over 21,000 people incarcerated in Alabama prisons as of September, but it is unclear how many have substance abuse problems or may qualify for treatment. According to the monthly statistical report for December 2018, 558 individuals completed drug treatment programs. For December 2024, that figure declined to 256 individuals who completed drug treatment programs.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-inmate-1024x647.jpg,,,2026-01-28 18:57:32.749026

(Photo by Blair Miller)A federal judge said a couple of Montana State University international students whose permission to be in the country was temporarily revoked by the U.S. government still need the protection of the court.
In an order this week, U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen denied a motion by the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to dismiss the case.
The U.S. government argued it had reinstated the status of the students in a visa tracking system, and it changed its policy.
As such, the government argued the lawsuit filed against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons was moot.
The judge disagreed. A preliminary injunction remains in place to protect the students from having their records unlawfully terminated as the case proceeds.
In March, ICE terminated thousands of records of foreign students in the United States following a criminal records search. The terminations resulted in numerous lawsuits across the country.
In April, MSU students John Roe and Jane Doe, an electrical engineering student from Iran and microbiology student from Turkey, respectively, learned their records were terminated.
The ACLU of Montana sued the U.S. government on their behalf.
The ACLU argued the government had terminated the records contrary to its own code, based on interactions with law enforcement, but without a conviction or prison sentence of more than one year, as required.
As such, the plaintiffs alleged the visa status revocation was unlawful. The court agreed and ordered the government to restore the records and not terminate them unless it had a valid reason.
In December, a lawyer for the government said the court should dismiss the case because the U.S. government had fixed the problems and had no plans to take the same actions again — “It was a disaster.”
In U.S. District Court of Montana in Missoula, the government also argued that if the students were wronged in the future, they could sue again.
The ACLU, however, said that idea didn’t take their lives into account, pointing to one student who had purchased a ticket to Colorado to say “goodbye forever” to his sister because he had planned to self-deport.
The ACLU also said just because the government voluntarily agreed it was in the wrong didn’t mean the court couldn’t rule on the legality of the question.
In the order, the judge largely agreed with the plaintiffs.
“It is not ‘absolutely clear’ that the challenged conduct will not recur,” the judge said.
The order reiterated an observation from May 2025, which it said remained unchanged: “Defendants’ approach to these particular issues presents an ever-changing landscape.”
The judge said the documents the government presented to argue its policy had changed weren’t adequate to find the matter was moot, and the government could be unpredictable in this area.
For example, one document the government presented offered a disclaimer that said it wasn’t intended to be “enforceable by any law.”
It also didn’t address the core of the case, the order said — that the records were revoked without a conviction and with no possibility of jail time beyond one year.
The order said even two declarations provided by U.S. officials didn’t help the government’s case; the judge found the statements to be “internally inconsistent, suggesting that not even the authors know what is intended.”
In an email, ACLU legal director Alex Rate said the order confirmed the arguments of the organization defending people’s civil liberties.
“The court found what we have known to be the case all along — that this administration cannot be trusted,” Rate said. “We look forward to holding them to account for their lawless behavior.”

(Photo courtesy of the Utah State Department of Corrections)A bill to add the firing squad as an execution method in Indiana failed in the House on Wednesday, falling three votes short of the required constitutional majority.
The legislation could still be brought back for another vote before Monday’s legislative deadline, however.
Bipartisan opposition to House Bill 1119 doomed the measure with a 48-47 tally. In the 100-member House, a bill must earn at least 51 votes to advance or be defeated.
Nineteen Republicans and 28 Democrats voted against the bill, which would allow the Indiana Department of Correction to choose between lethal injection and a firing squad when carrying out death sentences.
Indiana lawmakers remove nitrogen hypoxia from execution bill

The unsuccessful vote came a day after lawmakers removed nitrogen hypoxia as an execution option. Additional amendments adopted Tuesday added mental health screening requirements for members of the execution team and revised language governing media witnesses to executions.
Bill author Rep. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, framed the proposal as a continuation of Indiana’s legal death penalty history.
“I understand this is a sensitive topic, and I respect and truly appreciate everybody’s passion and emotion on this issue, but the actual issue is not the death penalty — that’s been decided over 200 years ago,” Lucas said. “And since then, this issue right now is simply amending existing Indiana law to include another method that we have done for the past 200 years, by evolving (execution) methods.
Lucas traced the state’s execution methods from hanging and electrocution to lethal injection, arguing that the firing squad is a response to modern challenges.
“The drugs that we are using to carry out lethal injection are becoming harder and harder to come by,” he added, referring to the high cost of pentobarbital used in Indiana’s execution process.
Firing squads have never been legal before in Indiana.
Opponents from both sides of the aisle countered that the bill raises moral and practical concerns and risks accelerating executions without fully addressing the broader debate around capital punishment.
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, emphasized that the measure, in its latest form, no longer hinged on drug availability.
“The bill was amended to essentially now say that it doesn’t matter if it’s difficult to get the drugs that would allow a humane execution,” Pierce said. “And now we’re just going to let the Department of Corrections decide whether they want to use the lethal injection or firing squad.”











I would hope that our society has advanced a bit since our state was founded, and would find a firing squad to be a barbaric way to form an execution.


– Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington


“I would hope that our society has advanced a bit since our state was founded, and would find a firing squad to be a barbaric way to form an execution,” he continued. “At the end of the day, we are killing a person, we are taking a human life in the name of the state, in the name of the people of Indiana. And I think that we should be very careful, and do that as humanely as possible, and we shouldn’t be in a big hurry to do it.”
Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, additionally raised concerns about wrongful convictions and the mechanics of a firing squad.
“You can’t tell me with 100% certainty that the person committed the crime,” Morris said in passionate floor remarks. “One thing is for certain — you will never bring that life back when it is gone.”
And Rep. Becky Cash, R-Zionsville, noted that since 1973 more than 2,000 people have been exonerated from death row.
Democrats also questioned whether the state was “moving backwards.”
“The death penalty — it simply has to go,” said Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis. “All this fuss is about our embarrassment with this heinous way of ending a life — a life of a person who, by definition, is not deserving of much of anything except the one thing the good Lord gave them, which is the life. It’s not for us to take it away. It’s not for us to fuss about how we take it away.”
“It’s not for us to kid ourselves that the only reason we’re here is because that chemical costs too much or doesn’t work right,” he concluded. “We should vote this bill down and get onto the real topic, which is to end this immoral procedure of killing another human being.”
Meanwhile, a Senate proposal authorizing firing squads effectively died after committee leaders declined to hold a vote to advance the measure to the full chamber.

A spokesperson with IDALS said the flock had about 25,000 birds. The outbreak occurred at a mixed-species game bird hatchery and included pheasants, quails and chukars, a game bird in the pheasant family.
The previous bird flu detection in Kossuth County occurred Thursday in a flock of chickens and game-bird pheasants and affected about 7,120 birds. 
The spokesperson could not disclose if the outbreaks occurred at the same facilities. 
This is the second, 2026 outbreak of the H5N1 strain of the bird flu in Iowa. 
Since the start of the current outbreak, which began in 2022, more than 186 million domestic birds, nationally, have been affected by the strain of the virus, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. 
The current public health risk of the highly pathogenic avian influenza is low, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as the flu is not currently known to spread between humans. 
IDALS urges livestock producers to “continue bolstering” biosecurity measures on their operations to prevent future outbreaks. Additionally, producers who detect symptoms like lethargy, a sudden increase in deaths, swollen heads, or difficulty breathing in their flocks, should contact their veterinarians immediately. 
The highly pathogenic avian influenza has also been detected in wild birds in Iowa. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources urges Iowans who notice 20 or more sick or dead birds in an area to contact the department.

Hob Bryan, D-Amory, speaks during a Public Health and Human Services Joint Committee hearing Thursday, Nov. 6, 2025, at the state Capitol in Jackson.","The governor is expected to consider a bill to help medical facilities make capital improvements more easily and to require the University of Mississippi Medical Center to seek state approval before opening clinical facilities outside its Jackson campus.
The legislation unanimously passed the Senate Wednesday. 
Lawmakers passed nearly identical changes to the state’s certificate of need law last session, but this year, they removed a provision that led Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to veto the legislation in April. The House unanimously passed the bill Jan. 21. 
Certificate of need law requires providers who want to open new services or make costly expansions – above a certain dollar threshold – first prove they are needed in their area. The process aims to lower costs and improve the quality and accessibility of health care by preventing duplication of services, but stakeholders are divided on whether or not the law accomplishes its goals. 
The bill that passed Wednesday would increase the cost threshold that triggers the requirement. It also seeks to level the playing field between the University of Mississippi Medical Center and other health care providers by limiting UMMC’s certificate of need exemption to the area around UMMC’s main campus and the Jackson Medical Mall. For years, UMMC has been exempt from certificate of need requirements for facilities or equipment that is used for educational purposes. 
Chairmen of the House and Senate’s public health committees have said hurrying this bill through the legislative process will allow lawmakers to propose additional changes this session to the existing law, which requires medical facilities to apply for a certificate of need, often called a CON, from the Mississippi State Department of Health before opening or adding new services. 
“It’s my intention to have one, if not two, additional certificate of need bills during this session, in particular something dealing with rural hospitals,” said Public Health and Welfare Chairman Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, during his committee’s meeting Jan. 21. 
On Wednesday, the House Public Health and Human Services committee passed a separate bill to exempt existing rural hospitals altogether from requiring state approval to open new health services or make improvements within a five-mile radius of the home hospital.

The bill, authored by committee Chairman Sam Creekmore, defines rural hospitals as critical access hospitals, those located in Delta counties or in counties with a population under 15,000 people. 
“This would allow our rural hospitals to add whatever service they want without having to go through the CON process, hopefully making them more profitable, and providing better health care services at the same time,” said Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany. 
Legislators noted that some rural counties, like Humphreys, do not currently have a hospital, meaning residents would not benefit from the proposal. 
The bill will now go to the House State Affairs committee for review. 
The State Board of Health subcommittee tasked with exploring changes to certificate of need laws has recommended excusing small rural hospitals with existing certificates from seeking approval before adding services or making capital expenditures that exceed statutory limits. It also recommended exempting substance use treatment and psychiatric services from acquiring a certificate of need from the state before opening. 
In Mississippi, where more than half of rural hospitals are at risk of closure, some people argue the legislation harms rural hospitals by restricting the services they are allowed to offer.
If the governor signs the bill that cleared the legislature Wednesday, it will become law immediately.
The legislation directs the health department to study easing some approval requirements for small hospitals for dialysis and geriatric psychiatry services. The bill also requires the agency to study requiring psychiatric facilities to treat a certain percentage of uninsured patients, and approves or revises certificates of need for specific facilities in Madison, DeSoto and Harrison counties. 
It did not include a provision to grant a new certificate of need to Oceans Behavioral Hospital Jackson. The language, which was added during last year’s session as an amendment by Bryan, would have ended a legal dispute between Oceans and another local hospital over the amount of free or low-cost care Oceans must provide to patients in need. The addendum led Reeves to veto lawmakers’ CON bill.
“The proposed amendment smacks of both imprudent legislative favoritism towards the entity that will receive the CON, as well as bald prejudice to the other market participants,” Reeves wrote in his veto message. “In either case, awarding a CON by legislative fiat is bad public policy.”
The state’s certificate of need law is a familiar target for legislative reform in Mississippi, but few substantial changes have been made to the law since 2016. 
Critics argue the law stifles competition and fails to decrease costs. Advocates say it ensures that communities have access to a range of health services, not only those that are profitable.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/06142309/Infant-mortality-hearing-5.jpg,,,2026-01-28 17:58:46.258962

HB 103 progress



FRANKFORT — A bill that would make water fluoridation optional in Kentucky, which supporters praise as a way to ensure local control, passed out of the House Local Government Committee Wednesday despite opposition from several health organizations. 
House Bill 103 would leave the decision on whether to add fluoride to water up to the local water systems’ governing bodies. The bill, which has been filed for several years but hasn’t passed both chambers, has more than 30 cosponsors. It passed the committee 13-4 and can go to the House floor. 
Rep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, said the key change this year is an added clause granting water districts immunity from civil actions related to their decision.

“I just want to emphasize to everybody,” Hart said. “This bill does not ban fluoride. It takes away the state unfunded mandate. It makes it local control.”  
Kentucky requires water utilities serving more than 3,000 customers to add low levels of fluoride to drinking water which, according to the National Institutes of Health, helps prevent cavities and tooth decay. 
Jack Kall, a Louisville dentist and the executive chair of the International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology, spoke in favor of the bill, saying if people don’t want fluoride, “you’re kind of stuck.”  
“There’s this risk,” Kall said while citing research showing drinking water containing more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter is associated with lower IQ in children. The standard level for drinking water is 0.7 per liter. 
“And even though we don’t have all the answers, when there’s that kind of a risk, I think it’s prudent to apply (the) precautionary principle,” Kall said.  He called it a “travesty” that “we just don’t have that freedom of choice.” 
Steve Robertson, the executive director of the Kentucky Dental Association, said a federal judge who in 2024 ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency needed to take action on concerns about recommended fluoride levels “overreached a little bit.”

“The preponderance of evidence shows that fluoride has been safe,” Robertson said. “I think we’ve reached the point on fluoride that the science part of this has turned into a spin contest.” 
Brittany Elam, the policy specialist with Kentucky Voices for Health, also spoke against the bill.
The committee received one letter of support for the bill from Cynthiana Mayor Isaac Dailey. 
“I strongly support public health efforts, and I also believe that locally owned and operated water systems are best positioned to evaluate the operational, financial, and community impacts of fluoridation,” wrote Dailey. “Water systems across the commonwealth differ greatly in capacity and resources, and local officials are accountable to the communities they serve when making infrastructure and treatment decisions.” 
In a letter opposing the bill, a slew of organizations — including the Kentucky Coalition for Healthy Children, Delta Dental of Kentucky, Kentucky Oral Health Coalition, Louisville Water Company and more — warned that losing access to fluoride in a state with already poor oral health would cause long-term health problems and damage the workforce.   
“Maintaining comprehensive community water-fluoridation programs promotes a healthy, more engaged workforce,” the letter says. “A higher prevalence of dental problems impacts Kentuckians’ ability to work and learn, with employees missing more work to address their own dental treatment needs, or to support their children’s needs, as kids are nearly three times more likely to miss school when they have poor oral health. Jeopardizing water fluoridation programs will lead to increased healthcare costs and disparities in oral health outcomes, particularly among low-income and underserved populations.”

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlgiht)PIERRE — South Dakota lawmakers advanced a resolution Wednesday at the Capitol that would ask voters in November to repeal the state’s obligation to provide expanded Medicaid coverage, potentially reopening a policy debate from four years ago.
The House State Affairs Committee voted 8-4 to send the bill to the full House of Representatives. If approved by the House and Senate, the measure would go to voters in the Nov. 3 election.
The proposed state constitutional amendment would repeal the Medicaid expansion requirement that voters adopted in 2022 with 56% support.
Medicaid is a low-income health insurance and disability assistance program, jointly funded by the federal government and the states. The 2022 ballot question expanded eligibility to adults with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level. Because the expansion is part of the state constitution, it can only be altered by voters.
Lawmakers will ask SD voters for permission to end Medicaid expansion if federal support declines

Rep. Aaron Aylward, R-Harrisburg, the new bill’s sponsor, said the state cannot afford the expansion. He cited budget estimates showing South Dakota’s cost for expansion enrollees would be roughly $35 million to $40 million annually over the next five years if the federal government continues to pay 90% of expansion costs. He added that the state faces a fiscal cliff if Congress reduces the federal share.
Americans for Prosperity lobbyist Don Haggar said placing a major policy directive in the state constitution was improper, adding that such decisions should be left to lawmakers who can adjust policy as budgets change.
“It’s unsustainable, and it’s a fiscal cliff, and we should at least allow the public to weigh in on this,” Haggar said. 
Opponents countered that voters settled the question in 2022 and put it in the constitution because lawmakers refused to expand eligibility. They said expansion has cost the state less than projected while covering about 30,000 South Dakotans at a cost of about $39 million annually for the state. Initial projections were 55,000 people, costing $70 million. 
AARP South Dakota’s Erik Nelson said repealing expansion would increase medical debt, delay preventive care, and increase insurance costs for all insured South Dakotans, who will be left paying for the care of uninsured people. He said the people in the expansion population are working, caregiving, in school, or dealing with chronic illness or disability. 
Nelson added that when people are uninsured, they’re likely to wait until they need to go to an emergency room, which is more costly than preventive care, and those costs will be pushed onto insured people’s premiums. 
Hospital and health care advocates — including Avera, Sanford and Monument Health — echoed the point, warning that repealing expansion would increase uncompensated care and shift costs to hospitals, who will have to pass them on to other patients and their insurance. 
Tim Rave, former speaker of the House and current president and CEO of the South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations, said $39 million, as part of a multi-billion-dollar state budget, is hardly the biggest issue for South Dakota’s fiscal concerns.
“It’s not Medicaid expansion that is busting the budget, just to be very clear about that,” Rave said. 
Several opponents also raised a procedural concern: A separate measure already placed on the November ballot by lawmakers would ask voters to authorize the termination of Medicaid expansion if federal support falls below 90%. Opponents of the new bill argued that adding a full-repeal question could create conflicting outcomes and invite a legal fight.

,DC,2026-01-28 22:49:48+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US Senate Dems demand mask ban, body camera requirement, IDs for immigration agents","Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-demand-mask-ban-body-camera-requirement-ids-immigration-agents,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Democrats on Wednesday detailed the “common sense” changes they want to implement for federal immigration enforcement, saying reforms must be added to a funding package that needs to become law before the weekend to avoid a partial government shutdown. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said after a closed-door lunch that lawmakers in the conference are united on several policy restrictions.They include:The end of roving patrols;Tightening the rules governing the use of warrants;Requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to coordinate with state and local law enforcement;Implementing a uniform code of conduct that holds federal law enforcement to the same set of standards that apply to state and local agencies;Barring the wearing of masks;Requiring the use of body cameras;Mandating immigration agents carry proper identification. “These are common-sense reforms, ones that Americans know and expect from law enforcement,” Schumer said. “If Republicans refuse to support them, they are choosing chaos over order, plain and simple. They are choosing to protect ICE from accountability over American lives.”Schumer said Democrats want to negotiate with Republicans, but called on Senate GOP leaders to separate out the funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security from a package that includes five other full-year appropriations bills. The bills must become law before a Friday midnight deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown. Schumer said he expects senators could “very quickly negotiate a bipartisan proposal” on restrictions to federal immigration activities.Thune, White House weigh inSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said shortly before Schumer spoke that he isn’t ruling out any options for funding the government.“These are all hypotheticals at this point, and I will reserve optionality to consider that,” Thune said. “But I think the best path forward, as I've said, is to keep the package intact. And if there are things that the Democrats want that the administration can agree with them about, then let's do that.”Thune expressed concern that any changes to the six-bill government spending package, which includes funding for the Department of Defense, would require it to go back to the House for final approval before it could become law. The House is out this week and isn’t scheduled to return to Capitol Hill until Monday, possibly causing a brief funding lapse if Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., doesn’t call that chamber back early. A White House official said in a statement to States Newsroom the administration wants to avoid a shutdown and is committed to a “productive dialogue with the Congress.”“A demand for agreement on legislative reforms as a condition of funding the Department of Homeland Security with a government funding deadline just 48 hours away is a demand for a partial government shutdown,” according to a White House official. “This bipartisan appropriations package, which the Democrats agreed to and have now walked away from, has been under negotiation for more than a month. The White House urges congressional Democrats not to subject the country to another debilitating government shutdown.”Schumer said during his press conference the White House “has had no specific, good, concrete ideas.”Alex Pretti killingCongress has approved half of a dozen full-year government funding bills, but hasn’t yet cleared the remaining measures, which make up a huge swath of government spending. A partial government shutdown would affect the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, State, Transportation and Treasury. The Executive Office of the President, Supreme Court and judicial branch would also go without funding. Democrats’ insistence for additional guardrails on how federal immigration officers operate follows the death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, the second person in Minneapolis shot and killed by federal immigration agents.ICE would still be able to operate during a shutdown, due to an influx of funding from the massive tax and spending cuts package Republicans passed and President Donald Trump signed into law last summer.The “One Big Beautiful Act” provided the Department of Homeland Security with $170 billion for immigration enforcement spread across four years, with $75 billion of that going directly to ICE. The Homeland Security appropriations bill at the center of the current dispute in Congress keeps ICE flat funded at $10 billion for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1 and will end on Sept. 30.In the wake of the Jan. 7 shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross, Democrats and Republicans agreed to some changes for the department that are provided for in the bill. That includes $20 million for body cameras for ICE and other federal immigration officers, $20 million for independent oversight of detention facilities and a $1 billion cut to Customs and Border Protection funding, which totals $18.3 billion.  Border Patrol agents’ shooting of Pretti on Jan. 24 spurred Democrats to call for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign and demand additional reforms at DHS. No masks, body cameras requiredMaine independent Sen. Angus King said Wednesday while the funding bill up for debate allocates money for optional body cameras, he wants to require immigration agents to wear them and to identify themselves. “I think one of the things that should be in it is no masks,” King said. “There's not a law enforcement agency in the United States that wears masks. I've never encountered that before in my life.”King added he wants to see increased “accountability” for federal immigration officers, including “independent investigations of injuries to either detainees or private citizens.”The top Democrat on the panel that deals with Homeland Security funding, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said the proposed changes are a start.“I’ve got a much longer list of reforms that I would like, but we’re operating in a world of possibility, and I think that these reforms are things that we could get done in the next couple days, or the next week,” he said. Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she’s okay splitting off the Homeland Security spending bill from the rest of the package. Murkowski also said she believes Trump should replace Noem.“Ultimately it's his call as to who he keeps in this position, whether it's Secretary Noem or someone else. I understand that. And he'll decide,” she said. “I just think that he deserves better.”Two ‘losers,’ Trump saysNorth Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis also called for Noem’s resignation, and for White House senior advisor Stephen Miller to be removed. Miller is the main architect of the Trump administration’s immigration policy, and played a pivotal role in the president's first administration.On Tuesday during an interview with ABC News, Trump called Tillis and Murkowski “both losers” for calling for Noem’s resignation and criticizing her handling of immigration operations in Minnesota. The president has stood by Noem.“I'm kind of excited about being called a loser,” Tillis said. “Apparently, that qualifies me for DHS secretary and senior advisor to the president.”South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds didn’t entirely rule out supporting a five-bill funding package if GOP leaders agree to remove the DHS appropriations bill. ""I won't get ahead of the president on it ... but even if you do that, the House still has to approve that,” Rounds said. “The question is, logistically, can they get back in time to do it by Friday night?""Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, ranking member on the House Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee, wrote in a social media post that while the current bill isn’t perfect, it “is better than those alternatives.”“But the worst thing Congress could do is allow a powerful department to operate with a blank check under a continuing resolution or shut the government down entirely.”",,,,2026-01-28 17:58:46.258962

George Muñoz (D-Gallup) cleared the New Mexico Senate on Jan. 28, 2026. The bill is aimed at recouping money from Gallup-McKinley County Schools after the Public Education Department reported a $35 million shortfall. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The New Mexico Senate voted 36-1 on Wednesday to pass a bill with an emergency clause that could start the process of recouping millions of dollars from Gallup-McKinley County Schools.
Lawmakers have been focused on the district’s finances since December, when New Mexico Public Education Department Secretary Mariana Padilla informed them of a $35 million shortfall in her agency’s budget. 
That shortfall traces to May 2025, when Gallup-McKinley canceled its contract with a virtual learning provider and accused it of breaching its contract with the district. As a result, about 3,000 students enrolled in the online learning program had nowhere to go. Two other districts in New Mexico stepped up and adopted about 1,500 students apiece into their virtual classrooms.
However, since school districts receive funding based on the prior year’s enrollment numbers, Gallup-McKinley continued to draw money for virtual students it no longer had, Padilla said at the December Legislative Finance Committee hearing. 
Deputy Superintendent Jvanna Hanks previously disputed that characterization to Source NM. 
Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup) on Wednesday said that Senate Bill 19, which he co-sponsored, would give state education officials the time they need to figure out how much money was overpaid to Gallup-McKinley and how they can get it back. It passed the Senate on a 36-1 vote and carries an emergency clause, meaning it will go into effect immediately if Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signs it into law.
“This was caused by one school district…I was so pissed off,” Muñoz said from the Senate floor. “They should have returned the money.” Currently, he added, there’s no law on the books that would let the state recoup the money.
The district did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The bill orders PED to consult with the state Department of Finance and Administration, the Legislative Finance Committee and the Legislative Education Study Committee to revisit allocations made under the current fiscal year’s budget. It would provide PED and the Legislature more time “to consider potential statutory changes to address” this issue during the 2026 session, according to an LESC analysis of the bill.
Several senators who supported the bill said that virtual learning is increasingly a necessity in a state as sprawling and rural as New Mexico but, as Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) said, “We have to do it the right way.”
Sen. Bill Soules (D-Las Cruces) did not hold back in his praise for the legislation.

Mike Kehoe’s plan to replace Missouri’s individual income tax with an expanded sales tax, the key word was trust.
The proposed constitutional amendment giving the legislature three years to overhaul state tax policies is open-ended —- it allows lawmakers to impose sales tax on any financial transaction exchanging goods or services.
In his State of the State address, the only parts of the economy Kehoe put off-limits was agriculture, health care and real estate. And as he presented the proposal to the House Commerce Committee, House Speaker Jon Patterson said everything else was up to lawmakers.
The state’s revenue needs will be protected by revenue triggers — at levels unstated in the proposed amendment — as the individual income tax is reduced and finally eliminated, Patterson said.
“It will be up to you to decide what trigger do we want, and make sure that it’s done in a responsible way, so that we don’t have things that have happened in other states,” Patterson said.
“So we’re asking the people to trust the legislature to raise their sales tax, to raise any other taxes that they see fit and to trust politicians to make those responsible decisions,” said state Rep. Nick Kimble, a Kansas City Democrat. 
“Well, not any more than they trust you now,” Patterson said, triggering a round of laughter in the packed committee room.
The proposal, as written, puts nothing off limits. It includes a three-year exemption to the Missouri Constitution’s requirements that tax increases win voter approval and that any tax “upon or measured by fuel used for propelling highway motor vehicles” be earmarked for road needs.
Patterson’s proposal seeks to end the personal income tax as early as Jan. 1, 2031. Income taxes on businesses and trusts would continue.
The committee did not vote on Wednesday. The next regularly scheduled meeting is next Wednesday and a vote could be held at that time.
If the measure is approved in both the House and Senate, it could be on a ballot as early as August.
The push to replace Missouri’s individual income tax is an effort to modernize the state’s tax structure, Patterson said. The individual income tax was first enacted in 1917 and a sales tax began in 1937.
The income tax is a drag on the state’s economy compared to states that have no personal income tax, he said. And the sales tax, which mainly applies to physical goods, is outdated because services, such as online streaming services, are exempt, he added.
“This is the first step in a long, methodical process that will take place if the citizens so choose to modernize our tax system and give people fairness in the tax system that we have,” Patterson said.
To bolster his arguments, proponents brought Aaron Hedlund, chief economist at White House Council of Economic Advisers, and Grover Norquist, founder of Americans for Tax Reform.
Hedlund is a former University of Missouri professor who now teaches at Purdue University. 
About 25 years ago, Hedlund said, Missouri generated about 2% of the U.S. economy, while the share now is 1.5%.
“I’m sick of Missouri losing,” he said. “For 25 years, we’ve oftentimes been in the bottom 10 of economic growth. Prior to the income tax reductions that started about a decade ago, we were oftentimes in the bottom five at economic growth. People are voting with their feet, and they’re not choosing Missouri.”
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, D-Kansas City, asks questions about a proposal for a statewide vote to eliminate the Missouri income tax on Wednesday during a hearing of the House Commerce Committee (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Democratic members of the committee were skeptical of whether the tax proposal was the way to solve that problem. House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, noted that Republicans have dominated Missouri politics for the past 25 years.
The GOP has controlled the state Senate since 2001, the Missouri House since 2003 and held the governor’s office for 14 of the past 26 years.
“I want to make the point that what we have been doing is not working,” Aune said. “I would posit that this is not the solution.”
Missouri’s personal income tax is almost flat, with a top rate of 4.7% on taxable incomes greater than $9,436. There are significant exemptions from the tax, including all Social Security payments, a share of retirement income and capital gains, which is profits from the sale of property or other assets.
The income tax generates about 65% of the state’s annual general revenue receipts, which were $13.4 billion in the year that ended June 30.
Sales tax is more complicated because local governments have a variety of levies they can put on the ballot. The basic state rate is 4.225%, with 3% dedicated to general revenue and the rest earmarked for public schools, conservation, state parks and soil conservation.
There are more than 50 locations in the state where the total sales tax is 11% or higher after adding local option taxes.
Matching the current revenue from the individual income tax without expanding the transactions that are taxed would require raising the sales tax to nearly 13%. .
One of the main focuses of testimony during Wednesday’s hearing was who would bear the greatest burden under an expanded sales tax. Opponents of the measure said wealthier Missourians would see their taxes decrease substantially while people of limited means will pay more in taxes.
After deductions, a married couple with a total income of about $36,000 pays no state income tax. The sales tax, however, would hit every purchase they make, opponents said.
Figures from the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy show that people in the lowest 20% of income pay about one-third more of their income in sales and other taxes in Tennessee, Texas and Florida than the same group in Missouri, said Jeremy LaFaver, a lobbyist for the Missouri Budget Project.
The top 1% of income earners in Missouri pay 5.7%, he said, while the same group in Florida pays 2.7%.
“They rely largely on consumer based taxes that impact low income, fixed income people,” LaFaver said. 
For one lawmaker, reducing the burden on high-income earners is a benefit of the plan.
Wealthy individuals run the businesses that employ Missourians, said state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican from Branson.
“The wealthy pay way more in taxes,” he said. “The percentage may look smaller, but they actually paid quite a bit more, and they are the foundation of our state’s tax base.”
Dennis Ganahl, founder of Mo Tax Relief Now, said the transactions that would be taxed are those used by wealthier people.
“The people with the lower incomes are just buying goods,” Granahl said. “They aren’t buying CPAs or masseuses or dog walkers or hair stylists or pedicurists or manicurists. All those are services that are used by wealthier people.”
Lower income Missourians use services that would be taxed, Aune responded.
“That is one of the wildest things I’ve heard in this building, if I’m being honest,” she said. “And I’ve heard some crazy stuff.”
The Missouri Constitution currently bans sales taxes on real estate transactions and any transactions not currently taxed. Both were added to the constitution after initiative petition campaigns organized by the Missouri Association of Realtors.
The campaigns cost $4.3 million to protect real estate sales from taxation in 2010 and $5.6 million to add protections against sales taxes on services.
Jason Zamkus, a lobbyist for the realtors, reminded the committee in his testimony that voters approved both measures by wide margins. Kehoe’s statements that he wants to exempt real estate are not included in the proposal, he noted.
“While we appreciate the governor’s statement in the State of the State that it’s his intent not to impact the real estate industry, unfortunately, the proposals that are pending before you currently are silent on that issue,” Zamkus said. 
The Realtors could be one of the most important opposition groups if the measure doesn’t include the protections for real estate sales. 
“If we were willing to spend that much a decade ago,” he said after testifying, “we are certainly going to fight to protect it.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Patterson-20260128-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-28 17:58:46.258962

RUTLAND — Windsor County Sheriff Ryan Palmer has pleaded not guilty to several criminal charges accusing him of sexual misconduct and stalking.
Palmer’s arraignment Wednesday afternoon in Rutland County Superior criminal court came a day after Vermont State Police announced they had summoned him to court to face charges following a monthslong investigation that began as a probe into department finances.
Police released few specific details Tuesday about the allegations leading to the criminal charges against Palmer, 39, of Windsor. However, a police affidavit that became public following the Wednesday arraignment provided more information.
The accusations against Palmer came from three women involved in incidents from September 2024 through last year.
The women reported to police that Palmer paid them to watch him perform a sex act online or in person and that he later stalked two of them by repeatedly driving by them while in his cruiser after they ended contact with him, including blocking him from phone or social media accounts, the affidavit stated.
The filing included images reportedly showing Palmer in his cruiser at locations where the two women were present, including a parking lot where one of the women worked.
The filing also contained images of online message exchanges reportedly between the women and Palmer, as well as images from accounts showing payments to them from Palmer.
One of the women told police that after Palmer paid her $100 to watch him perform a sex act, she told him that he just “broke the law,” the affidavit stated. The woman then said Palmer replied to her, “So did you,” according to the filing.
Palmer, through his attorney Dan Sedon, entered not guilty pleas Wednesday to seven charges, including lewd and lascivious conduct, two counts of soliciting prostitution, two counts of aggravated stalking with a deadly weapon and two counts of obstructing justice.
Judge Cortland Corsones did not find probable cause for four other charges prosecutors sought to file against Palmer, including two counts of compounding a felony and two counts of making  false claims.
Bennington County Deputy State’s Attorney Jared Bianchi said during Wednesday’s arraignment that he would look to fix paperwork in connection with those four charges and try to refile them. 
The prosecution is being handled by the Bennington County State’s Attorney’s Office to prevent a conflict with having the Windsor County State’s Attorney’s Office prosecuting a law enforcement official it works with. 
Corsones did not set bail for Palmer. Instead, the judge imposed several conditions on him while the case remains pending, including prohibiting Palmer from contacting certain witnesses as well as preventing him from possessing a firearm.
Bianchi had requested a condition calling on Palmer to surrender his law enforcement certification while the case remained pending. Corsones said he didn’t believe he had the authority to impose that condition on the elected sheriff of Windsor County.
Palmer, speaking to reporters after the hearing, maintained his innocence and said he would not be resigning from his sheriff’s post.
Palmer did say he would “step back” from overseeing the day-to-day operations of the law enforcement agency, handing those duties off to department member Claude Weyant, who is also the elected Windsor County high bailiff.
“There is a lot more to this story,” Palmer said. “That aside, this is my personal life, things I’ve done in my personal life, and I just ask the people out there not to have that reflect on their views of the Windsor County Sheriff’s Department.”  
Palmer, a Democrat, was elected to a four-year term as sheriff in 2022 and is up for re-election in November. Prior to his election, Palmer served with the Windsor Police Department and in 2017 was acquitted following a jury trial on charges including aggravated assault with a deadly stemming from shooting a man during a 2014 undercover operation, the Valley News reported at that time.
Sedon, Palmer’s attorney, said it was “telling” that none of the pending charges against his client involved allegations of financial misconduct, which initially prompted the state police investigation.  
“At the end of the day, we’re confident that any allegation here concerns private consensual behavior between consenting adults.” Sedon said. “As lurid as these allegations may be, they are his private life and don’t reflect his service as the sheriff.”  
Vermont sheriffs’ departments across the state have drawn scrutiny in recent years after some were charged with criminal offenses but remained on the job. State lawmakers have proposed reforms seeking greater oversight, but since sheriffs are independently elected, they are answerable to the voters who put them there. 
If convicted of all five felony and two misdemeanor charges, Palmer faces up to 27 years in prison.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee approved a bill that would require companies that have more than 50 employers to give breastfeeding mothers time and space to breastfeed.
HB 290, sponsored by Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, is slightly different from federal law. The federal law considers a bathroom to be a “reasonable” location, but Givan’s bill specifies the location to be a room other than a bathroom.
“Some women feel that it’s unsanitary to have to do that, so there should be a smaller closet or some type of reasonable accommodation,” Givan said.

The House Health Committee approved three amendments to the bill, all brought by Rep. Paul Lee, R-Dothan, who chairs the committee. The first increased the size of the company that is required to give accommodations to 50 employees. Previously, there was no distinction.
“The thought is an office with three to five employees, certainly they’re going to let them do it, but not to necessarily spend a ton of money to build an extra room or whatever the case is,” Lee said.
The second added that the accommodations can only be given up to one year after the child is born. The federal law allows accommodations up to two years after the child is born, Givan said.
The third required that the location the employer provides to be “reasonably accessible” to the work area.
All three amendments passed unanimously.
“We pass bills every day that are already bills that are enacted into Congress, but we can also make modifications for the purpose that would best fit our state,” Givan said.

The proposal (HB 1421) sponsored by Rep. Jon Albert, R-Frostproof, says that any lands determined to be suitable for cattle grazing must be described in the land management plan and allowed to be leased for such purpose. If no portions of the land are deemed “suitable,” the management plan must explain that decision.
It is the word “suitable” that prompted angst among some Democratic members of the committee.
“Suitable is in the eye of the beholder,” said Rep. Kelly Skidmore, D-Boca Raton. “Someone might not be a suitable boyfriend for your daughter. That might be your opinion but not your daughter’s. So everyone can have a different idea of what suitable is.”
Albert said that what lands are deemed suitable would be up to the state’s Acquisition and Restoration Council.
While only a few members of the public spoke out against the bill, the Sierra Club Florida Chapter sent out an action alert urging its members to oppose the measure, warning it would harm sensitive wildlife habitat and undermine conservation management on public lands.
Skidmore said she had received 600 emails opposing the measure.
Rep. Dean Black, R-Jacksonville, is a cattle rancher himself and called it a “common-sense bill.”
“What we’re really going to be talking about is dirt roads, roads that have grass growing on them, and that the state now pays people to mow,” he said. “And instead of taking taxpayer dollars and  paying someone a lot of money to mow it at a two or three-week interval, we’re just going to let the cows eat the grass. And the advantage that will come from that is that we will produce beef from something that otherwise gone to waste. And that will increase the amount of beef produced in Florida.”
Rep. Lindsay Cross, D-St. Petersburg, was one of two members of the committee who opposed the measure. She said the proposal needs more guardrails — or, literally, fences. “I want to make sure that we are maintaining parks for public access. For water quality. For wildlife and conservation and just making sure that those goals are aligned.”
Five state parks now feature cattle grazing as part of their management plans and maintain cattle grazing agreements: Kissimmee Prairie Preserve State Park, Colt Creek State Park, Alafia River State Park, Lake Kissimmee State Park, and St. Sebastian River Preserve State Park.
In addition, three of Florida’s five water management districts offer Cattle Grazing Land Leasing Programs that allow lease holders to temporarily keep public lands in production while maintaining the property in a manner consistent with the land management requirements, according to a House analysis.

His resignation – the fifth in the House this year – will leave Democrats with a temporary 200-198 majority. Special elections for four seats are scheduled later this year.
Grove said he was leaving public service for a role in the private sector, without elaborating. He told the York Dispatch on Wednesday he was tired. “I did my time. It’s time to move on,” Grove said.

First elected in 2008, Grove served as chairperson of the House Appropriations and State Government committees and is the ranking GOP member of the Labor and Industry Committee. 
He also championed an expansive overhaul of the commonwealth’s election code. While then-Gov. Tom Wolf vetoed the bill in 2021 over concerns about a voter ID requirement, elements of the bill were later made law.
“I am eternally grateful to the people who placed their trust and faith in me over the years, and I thank them for allowing me to be their voice in Harrisburg,” Grove said “I hope I met the expectations of the homegrown leader they believed I could be and that my work reflected the values and priorities of the community we share.”

(Photo by Katiuscia Noseda/Getty Images)When my parents married in 1965, my mother was making $75 a week and my father was taking home $73. For the first year, they were a two-income household, but my mom left the workforce the next year — two days before my big brother was born.
With my dad as the sole breadwinner, my mom took on the endless toil of managing day-to-day operations for a growing family. The job didn’t get easier. With my arrival in 1972, she was handling four kids under the age of 6, all day, every day. 
My dad didn’t go to college, but I’d say he did pretty well for himself. He ran the production floor of a small paper company in Massachusetts — a hands-on, blue-collar manager who dressed in Dickies and steel-toed boots. My mom wasn’t a college grad either, but she mastered the art of raising three boys and a girl while my dad worked his long hours. Somehow they still both had the energy to coach Little League, attend school events, throw some pretty raucous pool parties, and, much later, help raise their nine grandkids.
When I think back to my childhood, it seems clear that we were pretty squarely a middle-class New Hampshire family. Some in town had much more than we did, but others had far less. We went on vacations — to Disney World, Niagara Falls, and Hilton Head Island. My parents were not renters but home-buyers — including their first, in Salem, purchased for $5,500 (for which they needed a second mortgage). And, amazingly, they put three of their four kids through college between 1984 and 1994, and paid off the loans themselves.
The median household income in 1965, when my parents started out that journey, was $6,900. That’s about $133 a week — $15 less than they were making before my mom left her job.
Back to the future
On Wednesday, the Bulletin published a short piece by Stateline revealing how far New Hampshire has come since the 1960s. Between 1970 and 2023, New Hampshire’s median household income grew by an inflation-adjusted 62.2%, ranking the Granite State just behind Utah and Colorado by percentage growth.
New Hampshire’s median is now about $97,000.
That’s great national news, right? I mean, out of the 50 states only one (West Virginia) saw a decline in inflation-adjusted dollars earned by the median household, and New Hampshire has done better than just about everybody else. 
But it doesn’t feel that way, does it?
To that point, The New York Times reported Monday on a new poll showing that “two-thirds of voters said they now think a middle-class lifestyle is out of reach for most people, and 77% say it has gotten harder to achieve than a generation ago.” If you’re wondering how that squares with the major gains in median household income nationally, well it doesn’t.
Food is expensive. Electricity is expensive. Used cars are expensive. College is expensive. Housing is expensive. Health care is expensive. Child care is expensive. Home repairs are expensive. Car repairs are expensive. Property taxes are expensive. Home heating is expensive. It all adds up to this: Life doesn’t just feel harder — it is. For nearly all of us.
Following the money
In October, CNBC reported that the “total wealth of the top 10% — or those with a net worth of more than $2 million — reached a record $113 trillion in the second quarter, up from $108 trillion in the first quarter, according to the Fed.” 
The CNBC report continues: “Since the pandemic, the top 0.1%, or those with a net worth of at least $46 million, have seen their total wealth nearly double to over $23 trillion.”
The top 10% of wealth holders in the United States hold 69% of all wealth, up from 56% in 1989, The New York Times reports.
Meanwhile, Kiplinger writes that 45,758 millionaires call New Hampshire home, and only six states have more millionaires per capita than the Granite State.
And, in 2020, a major Pew Research study found that “upper-income families were the only income tier able to build on their wealth from 2001 to 2016, adding 33% at the median.” The news was not so good for lower- and middle-income families, who saw their median net worth “shrink by 20% and lower-income families experienced a loss of 45%.”
You see, there is a big difference between income and wealth. And it is damn expensive to lack wealth in America — just ask anyone who has had to put an unexpected bill on a credit card because they didn’t have enough in savings.  
So why not just save more?
The living wage
According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology living wage calculator, two working adults in a four-person household would each have to make $31.19 an hour — nearly 4.5 times the minimum wage — to earn a living wage in New Hampshire. The combined salary for a couple earning that living wage is $129,750.
Again, that’s a living wage — the amount you need to meet expenses like food, housing, and transportation. That is not a wealth-building wage. It is not even a savings-building wage.
But even if it was, state data shows that only 1 in 7 New Hampshire communities has a median household income at or above the annual living wage as determined by MIT.
Life below the living wage
That two-thirds of Americans believe a middle-class lifestyle — the kind my parents set out to build 60 years ago — is out of reach is not purely one political party’s fault. In fact, the United States is not alone in grappling with vast income inequality — in which the ultra-wealthy claim a greater and greater share of total wealth over time.
But the Republican Party — nationally and here in New Hampshire — has largely committed itself to trying to aid the middle class in two wrongheaded ways: 1) policies that help the wealthiest citizens and corporations grow their wealth to such absurd levels that it (maybe?) trickles down to the rest, and 2) attacking those with the least for the little they have. 
That is the reason for the dehumanizing treatment of immigrants and anyone who dares stand up for immigrants — and I don’t think you need any hyperlinks for that one.
That is the reason for cuts to SNAP and Medicaid.
That is the reason for work requirements and union busting.
That is the reason why, in New Hampshire, taxes are repealed and reduced, despite the state’s revenue problems and resulting budget cuts, which typically downshift costs to those who can least afford them. To you, in other words.
So neither party is blameless, but the GOP is actively and single-mindedly widening the gap between the wealthiest citizens and everybody else.
How do we fix it, any of it?
Over these past 12 very long months, I’ve heard from critics who tell me that all I do is complain in my commentaries and, worse, I don’t offer any solutions. They wish I would express a little gratitude.
They have no idea how grateful I am — for my parents and siblings, my wife and daughters, this beautiful state. Every day I feel fortunate for this life — but none of what I write is about what I have or what I don’t. It’s about wanting to move forward with my neighbors, not instead of them. My solutions are embedded in what they see as my complaints: There is more suffering than there needs to be.
So let’s chip away.
The current top marginal tax rate (people making over $640,600) in the U.S. is 37%; in 1965 it was 70%. Maybe there’s something that can be done there — such as a proposal from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2019 for a 70% marginal rate on income above $10 million. Failing that, maybe we can at least enforce the tax policies we have now instead of gutting the IRS.
Beyond taxing income at the federal level, why not consider a wealth tax? (Well, I know why not but let’s pretend for a moment that the people who would most hate a wealth tax don’t own the government.)
And while we’re on the subject of taxes, maybe, just maybe, this state can take a fresh look at an income tax instead of spit-shouting “New Hampshire Advantage” every time it’s mentioned. It’s possible that a broad-based tax is not the answer for New Hampshire, but let’s not act like gutting public schools in a ham-handed (and future-destroying) effort to trim property taxes is the only path available to us. Why can’t we at least run the numbers, honestly?
Let’s help strengthen unions instead of busting them.
Let’s do better here, a lot better, than the federal minimum wage of $7.25, as 30 states have done.
Let’s seriously examine single-payer health care and universal child care, and instead of punishing poor people for their poverty let’s take a crack at trickle-up economics. Let’s build the social safety net instead of ripping it to shreds.
I’m not asking for too much, I don’t think. I just want my daughters’ generation to have the same shot at a decent life that my parents had.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1960skitchen-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 17:58:46.258962

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — More than 19,000 naked baby dolls at varying stages of fetal development were splayed on tables Wednesday in the heart of the Kansas Statehouse.
They were meant to visually contextualize the number of abortions performed in Kansas in 2024. They were the work of Kansans for Life to commemorate its annual March for Life demonstration, which served to lift up pregnancy resource centers, condemn Kansas courts and gather Kansans from across the state who share a motivation to abolish abortion.
Hundreds of attendees walked from the Topeka Performing Arts Center, which hosted Catholic speeches and a mass Wednesday morning, to the Statehouse, where the organization held an anti-abortion rally on the building’s south steps.
The rally’s speakers took aim at a modern “culture of death,” in the words of Senate President Ty Masterson, and blamed courts for abortion being allowed in Kansas, as Attorney General Kris Kobach said.
“Kansas has really become, unfortunately, the abortion capital of the Midwest,” Kobach said. “So how did we get there?”
He asked the crowd whether “the legislators here caused the problem.” Members of the crowd shouted “no.”
He asked if Congress caused the problem. Again, the crowd said “no.”
“How about the Kansas courts? Did they start that problem?” he asked.
Some in the crowd gave a smattering of unsure “no” and “yes” responses.
Then Kobach pointed across the street at the Kansas Supreme Court building.
“As you may know, a few years ago, the court invented an invisible right to abortion in the Kansas Constitution,” he said.
In 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court decided the Kansas Constitution’s right to bodily autonomy includes terminating a pregnancy. A few years later, almost 60% of Kansas voters who participated in the August 2022 primary election rejected an anti-abortion ballot measure. The Supreme Court in 2024 affirmed its earlier decision and struck down a state law that banned the most common second-trimester abortion procedure.
Kobach said the Kansas Supreme Court “twisted the meaning” of the state constitution, creating an uphill fight to defend anti-abortion laws in court.
He also pointed to a recent case from an abortion provider against him in Johnson County, which hasn’t yet been decided. The case will determine whether mandates such as waiting periods, state-approved signs and fetal pain information are allowed under state law.

Anti-abortion policy goals
Kansans for Life also released its 2026 legislative priorities Wednesday.
“The focus is on continuing support for organizations that offer life-affirming options for pregnant women, strengthening informed consent protections for women, and protecting taxpayers from being compelled to subsidize the abortion industry,” said Jeanne Gawdun, the organization’s director of government relations.
The organization wants lawmakers to continue to fund a $3 million program that gives money to pregnancy resource centers across the state. It also wants legislators to add protections for those centers, which are typically religiously affiliated nonprofits that often are not staffed by medical professionals and serve to dissuade people from having abortions.
As of 2023, Kansas has 44 pregnancy resource centers, also called crisis pregnancy centers, according to the Crisis Pregnancy Center Map, which consists of data compiled by health researchers from the University of Georgia. Kansas has offered funding for the centers since legislation passed in 2024. It also offers to centers’ donors a tax break, deducting up to 70% of a donation under the Pregnancy Resource Tax Act, which was passed in 2024.
Gawdun said bills are in the works to remove Medicaid reimbursement eligibility from abortion providers and modify the Women’s Right to Know Act to modify the definition of informed consent. The act is one of the pieces of the pending lawsuit against Kobach in Johnson County.
A dozen Republican legislators and state Treasurer Steven Johnson attended the rally. It was the second day of anti-abortion demonstrations at the Statehouse.
Margot Scobee, a Wichita resident who tries to attend the march in Topeka every year, and Kathleen Timmermeyer, also of Wichita, attended the rally because of their desire to see an end to abortion.
“It’s gone on too long,” Scobee said.
The two have marched in Washington, D.C., where an annual rally has taken place since the first anniversary of Roe v. Wade in 1974 — Scobee in 2014 and Timmermeyer in 1986.
Protesting abortion is part of their lives, and it has always held meaning, they said.
“It’s not a fly-by-night thing,” Timmermeyer said.
Paul Rhodes of Hutchinson is similarly immersed in the anti-abortion movement. He said he tries to balance two scriptures when considering both sides of the abortion issue. One asks people, “be fruitful and multiply,” and the other asks people to “not stand in the way of sinners.” 
“Here’s what I really believe,” Rhodes said. “America is on the cusp of a civil war, and it’s going to be over abortion.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1280176-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-28 17:58:46.258962

Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Moscow, who is sponsoring the new legislation, said the 30-day public comment period would be required any time the Idaho Fish and Game Commission adopts, repeals or amends notices of proposed proclamations on season-setting proposals. 
“Idaho Fish and Game undertakes season-setting every other year, so a 30-day public comment period is reasonable, especially when many natural resources proposals require a 60- 90- or even 120-day public comment period,” Foreman said. 
“Sportsmen and hunting organizations need a reasonable amount of time to absorb, analyze and respond to season setting proposals,” Foreman added. “The Idaho Fish and Game Commission big game season setting for deer and elk is sort of the main event for most Idaho hunters, and many of my constituents feel that the current season setting process could benefit from an increased public comment period.”

Current Idaho law requires notice of proposed proclamations to be provided in the same manner as public, open meetings, but does not require a specific minimum comment period. 
Members of the Senate Resources and Environment Committee voted to introduce the bill during a meeting Wednesday afternoon at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
The new bill will be assigned a bill number and publicly posted to the Idaho Legislature’s website after it has been read across the desk on the floor of the Idaho Senate, which will likely happen Thursday at the Idaho State Capitol. 
Introducing the bill clears the way for it to return to the Senate Resources and Environment Committee for a full public hearing.

Shane Jett, R-Shawnee, speaks in favor of his amendment to Senate Joint Resolution 22 on May 13, 2025, in the Senate chamber of the state Capitol in Oklahoma City. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A Republican senator has filed legislation to bar lawmakers from drinking alcohol on the job after he accused some of them of being drunk while taking critical votes.
Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee, said he filed Senate Bill 1640, which prohibits legislators from consuming and possessing alcohol while on duty, after noticing some were intoxicated on the Senate floor during the last day of the 2025 session when they were discussing a bill to fire Allie Friesen, the state’s former mental health commissioner.
While Jett did not specifically name any senator, he said that during debate about the bill that ultimately removed Friesen, “you can see that there were members who used some very aggressive language and in their speech pattern and their appearance indicated inebriation.” He said that he got “harangued” in speeches “that we know were fueled by Tito’s and vodka.”
Senate Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said Wednesday that Jett’s accusations were “baseless and lack credibility.”
Jett has attacked colleagues, used childish rhetoric and is making serious accusations without evidence, Paxton said.

As a result, Paxton said he has removed Jett as vice chairman of the Rules committee at the request of the panel’s chairman and barred Jett from serving as a presiding officer, a rotating position in which an individual runs the floor.
Jett, who leads the conservative Oklahoma Freedom Caucus, said when he reported his concerns to Paxton on the final night of session, the Republican leader did nothing.
“He approached me with these claims in the waning hours of the last day of session, at a point when no action could be taken,” Paxton said.
Jett has exhibited a pattern of conduct that reflects his need for attention rather than responsible governance, Paxton said.
Senate rules prohibit senators from being drunk or drinking while on the Senate floor, Jett said.
Jett’s bill would require any lawmaker suspected of being intoxicated to take a breathalyzer test administered by a member of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, according to the measure.
On the first offense, a violator would be subject to immediate expulsion from the legislative chamber for the remainder of the day, a fine of not less than $500 but not exceeding $1,000, and referral to the chamber’s ethics committee.
A second violation within a year carries a fine of $1,000 to $2,500, mandatory alcohol education or treatment at the member’s expense, expulsion from the chamber for not less than three consecutive legislative days and a referral to the chamber’s ethics committee.
A third violation within 24 months carries a penalty expulsion for the remainder of the session, a fine of not less than $2,500 but not more than $5,000 and automatic initiation of removal proceedings.
The Senate President and House Speaker would be responsible for enforcement. Failure to enforce sobriety within their respective chambers would subject the presiding officer to the same penalties as the violating member, according to the measure.
Jett said he does not drink alcohol at work, but may have wine with his wife.
“I am very scrupulous not to drink with people outside of my family context, especially, especially in a political context,” Jett said.
He said taxpayers have the right to expect more from those who are making the laws governing alcohol.
Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, said she has never seen a member drink alcohol on the floor, but said some do have alcohol in their offices.
Intoxicating beverages and low-point beer are among a list of items prohibited inside the Capitol, according to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services.
Boren said she fears Jett’s bill could create a “witch hunt” used to protect or target certain individuals.
“People do need to be sober when they are voting,” Boren said.
Jett said the bill needed to be filed because the incident was embarrassing and leadership was doing nothing.
“I want to make it abundantly clear I am not to be trifled with and I will hold them accountable when they break the rules,” Jett said.

Chris Lewis, R-Louisville. Jan. 28, 2026. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — A bill that would allow eligible businesses in Kentucky to operate cigar bars, which health organizations say could compromise public health, passed the House Local Government Committee Wednesday. 
House Bill 194 says a person can operate a cigar bar in Kentucky if they hold a valid alcoholic beverage license and patrons could smoke indoors or outdoors. 


HB 194 progress 


When it was filed, it said eligible businesses needed to make at least 15% of their annual gross income from “from the on-site sale of cigars, pipe tobacco, paraphernalia and accessories related to the consumption of cigars and pipe tobacco, and rental of humidors, or a combination thereof.” A substitute version of the bill ups that to 25%. 
The bill would also require cigar bars to notify people that they will be exposed to smoke at the facility, which would be required to have a smoke-free space for deliveries and related business with non-employees. 
“This is not about smoking cigars in a regular bar, your local bowling alley, restaurant or in any other public place that doesn’t currently allow smoking,” said sponsor Rep. Chris Lewis, R-Louisville. “If you don’t want to be exposed to cigar smoke in a public place where smoke free laws currently exist, nothing in this bill changes your ability to maintain that separation.” 
Another year, another attempt to push KY’s Juul settlement dollars to prevention, cessation

A letter of support from the DC-based Premium Cigar Association says the bill has “important safeguards that distinguish cigar bars from other establishments and ensure the bill applies only to businesses intentionally designed to serve adult consumers.” 
Several health and advocacy organizations sent a letter on Tuesday to all members of the House Local Government Committee in which they condemned the bill, saying it “creates a loophole that will severely weaken these local laws putting population health protections and healthcare cost savings in jeopardy.” 
Signed by 11 organizations — including the Foundation For A Healthy Kentucky, Kentucky Medical Association, Kentucky Youth Advocates and more — the letter says the legislation “preempts local authority” and “sends the wrong message to Kentucky’s youth.” 
“Traditional cigars, little cigars and cigarillos are sold in a variety of flavors that appeal to youth including sour apple, cherry, grape, chocolate and menthol,” the letter says. “In communities that allow indoor cigar smoking, youth and young adults may perceive that it’s socially acceptable to use cigars, and they may get the false impression that cigars are safer or a status symbol.” 
Rep. George Brown Jr., D-Lexington, cast the sole vote against the bill, saying it is “counter to local control.” Rep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, passed. The bill can now go to the House floor.

(March 7, 2022, screenshot via DeSantis Rumble page)A  state administrative court is being asked to put the brakes on a move by the DeSantis administration to shore up an alleged $120 million funding deficit in an HIV/AIDS program by paring back program eligibility and restricting access to the medications it covers.
Attorneys for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation maintain in their complaint that the Florida Department of Health, which helps administer The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, is violating state law because it didn’t pass the requisite rules needed to make the changes to the program.
The National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors estimates that more than 16,000 patients in Florida will lose coverage because of this change in department policy. The foundation is asking that the state Division of Administrative Hearings expeditiously schedule and hear the case and that a judge issue a recommended order before March 1, when the changes are slated to take place.
“If these cuts go through, you’re going to have sicker people and your are going to have more HIV infections, which is ultimately going to cost the state a lot more money,” Esteban Wood, the organization’s  director for advocacy, legislative affairs, and community engagement said Wednesday during a press availability announcing the administrative complaint.
The organization has been “inundated” with hundreds of calls from patients who want to know what the changes mean and how they will impacted them, Wood said.
“What we are seeing right now is a lot of fear and anxiety from patients across the state,” he said. “These patients are terrified. These are working Floridians who did everything right. And we expect to see these interruptions in their regiment and with their medication as soon as March 1.[

Since 1990, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program has provided grants to states to help people living with HIV and AIDS access to medications through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, or ADAP.
The grants can also be used for insurance premium assistance, plus cost-sharing support to low-income, uninsured, or underinsured individuals.
Since 2007, the program in Florida has been open to people who earn up to 400% of the federal poverty level, which for 2026 translates to an annual salary of $62,600 for a single person. For a family of four it’s $128,600 annually.
The DOH in January began issuing letters to some ADAP patients advising of them changes.
One letter, according to the underlying complaint, advised patients that as of Feb. 28 they no longer would be able to take advantage of the premium assistance and medication support through ADAP. The letter advises that the state changed the income eligibility, paring it back from 400% of the poverty level to no more than 130%, which is $20,345 annually for an individual or $41,795 for a family of four.
The second letter the DOH sent informs patients that while they remain eligible for services through ADAP they could no longer take Biktarvy, a daily pill used to treat HIV in adults and children weighing at least 31 lbs.
The DOH also posted the changes on its website.
The letters and the website maintain the changes are being driven by “rising health care insurance premiums nationwide and lack of additional Ryan White Grant funding.”
The website maintains the “adjustments” were made to “ensure resources” for “the greatest number of individuals within our funding constraints,” and that they will help prevent a $120 million shortfall in the program.
Follow the rules
The administrative rule-making process can be slow and burdensome. But it’s a process through which the public can discuss with bureaucrats proposed policy changes and provide input.
Tom Myers, the foundation’s chief of public affairs and general counsel, said in regards to the ADAP changes that the rule-making process also would have provided the public with some transparency, including information about the the projected $120 million deficit the DOH says it faces if no changes are made.
“There’s a process that the department has to follow in trying to make these cuts. And with a very good reason, because of the known harmful impact of these cuts,” he said.
Wood said the foundation hopes an administrative law judge will require the DOH to go through rule-making if it wants to push ahead with the changes.
“What we are hoping is the administrative courts in Florida will say, ‘Wait a second. If you’re going to make these changes or if you want to make these changes, you gotta follow the rules, which you clearly haven’t followed. Give it time, give it the proper process. Hear from people. Study the issue, study the problem before you make these cuts, which are definitely going to harm people,'” Myers said. “And that’s really what this lawsuit is all about.”
Attorneys for the foundation in their complaint asked that they be given the right to amend their administrative complaint because of outstanding public records requests with the DOH. Moreover, rhey asked that the complaint be expedited given the looming deadline.
“Because approximately 16,000 individuals in Florida stand to lose their life-saving ADAP benefits and will be left without viable alternatives to live healthy lives and prevent additional spread of HIV as of March 1, 2026, the standard timeframe of 30 days for the hearing to commence and 30 days to render a Final Order provided (in statute) is direly inadequate. The Department has brought this emergency to patients on itself, and AHF respectfully requests an expedited scheduling order for discovery, final hearing, and Final Order be considered. AHF recommends five days for discovery, 14 days for a hearing, and 14 days for a Final Order,” the complaint says.
Advocating before the Legislature

While the foundation filed an administrative complaint to try to stop the changes, other advocates are looking to the Legislature for help, including Ft. Lauderdale resident Michael Rajner, who relies on the ADAP program for co-payments to help lower the cost of his medications.
Rajner said he isn’t one of the 16,000 people who will lose eligibility for the program in March — because he doesn’t take Biktarvy, that change won’t affect him, at least not now. “But if my doctor every wanted to put me on the medication I wouldn’t be able to go on it,” he said.
The 2026 Session began Jan. 13. In that time, Rajner has twice testified in the Senate about the DOH’s proposed changes, making appearances in the Appropriations and Health and Human Services committees.
He attended the foundation-supported Fight For Our Lives rally at the DOH’s Tallahassee headquarters on Jan. 21 and, later that day, met with Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo for about 30 minutes. It was the second meeting he had with the DOH — the first was on Jan. 16.
“The crux of the message was they’re out of money and the Legislature needs to give them $120 million to close this gap that they continue to blame on federal changes,” Rajner told the Florida Phoenix.
But, Rajner claims, the DOH has not asked the Legislature for money and when he pressed them as to whether they would they “just sat there with their mouths open.”
“They said they weren’t going to ask the Legislature and that the Legislature just needs to kind of do it,” Rajner told the Phoenix. “And so they are not acting as good stewards of the program.”
Rajner said he wasn’t comforted by what he heard from DOH officials at either of the two meetings he had with them.
The Ft. Lauderdale resident, who was making the long drive from Tallahassee to South Florida on Wednesday, said he was feeling more optimistic after meeting with Senate President Ben Albritton’s staff Tuesday.

“I left that meeting hopeful. Because not only in that meeting, but in other meetings with other senators, I keep hearing how Senate leadership is engaging the Florida Department of Health to bring forward more information so they can continue to study this issue and understand what possible solutions to be considered. It felt reassuring also knowing that these [senators] were very aware of my remarks in [the committees.]
“So, they are listening. I feel some comfort in knowing that dialogue is ongoing and I hope that solutions come forward before it’s too late, when on March 1 people will lose access to their insurance coverage and be in a worse situation.”
Although it wasn’t a scheduled meeting, Rajner had a chance encounter with House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami. Rajner was walking his dog, Baby Blue, around the Capitol complex when he bumped into the speaker. Rajner took  advantage of his luck and talked to Perez about the ADAP program while he could.
“I felt good about his level of understanding of it and that the crisis actually exists,” Rajner said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-2022-03-07-171712-1024x574.png,,,2026-01-28 17:58:46.258962

Dane Diehl, a Butler Republican, Wednesday afternoon. Diehl's proposal largely mirrors a request from Gov. Mike Kehoe to grade schools A-F (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri families are seeking a clear way to identify the quality of their local schools, parents and advocacy organizations told the House Education Committee Wednesday.
The committee was discussing a bill sponsored by state Rep. Dane Diehl, a Republican from Butler, that seeks to give schools A-F grades for their students’ performance and extra state funding to high-scoring schools.
Whether a new grading system will solve the problem — and what factors go into the scoring —was heavily debated.
“The process of letter-grading, on the surface, gives another piece of information that might be useful to parents around the state,” said state Rep. Brad Banderman, a Republican from St. Clair. “But it has an inherent weakness.”
Many won’t look beyond a letter grade and see important context, he said.
The committee’s chairman, Republican state Rep. Ed Lewis of Moberly, acknowledged problems with the bill — like a provision giving teachers “bonuses” he said conflicts with the Missouri Constitution.
But A-F grades for schools are inevitable, he said, pointing to a push from the governor’s office.
“It is not like we can push it down the road because then we’re going to be left with something we didn’t control,” Lewis told the committee, indicating that he intends for the committee to make changes to the bill.
Earlier this month, Gov. Mike Kehoe issued an executive order seeking to create an “A–F grade card system grounded primarily in academic performance and growth” in addition to the state’s current accountability system.
“Parents deserve clear, easy-to-understand information about how schools are performing so they can make the best decision for their children,” he said in his State of the State address.
While Kehoe doesn’t have the authority to unilaterally change school accountability measures, his order puts pressure on the State Board of Education to carry out his plan.
Diehl’s legislation, much like Kehoe’s executive order, would focus on academic achievement and growth as 75% of scores. The remaining 25% is based on four-year graduation rates and the percentage of graduates deemed ready for college or the workforce.
The state’s education department publishes annual performance reports, which displays scores as a percentage that could be easily translated into A-F grades. But its system has many factors, and some have criticized the program for giving 30% weight to school improvement measures.
“Missouri’s current accountability system places too much weight on administrative process rather than student success, and it does not give a straightforward picture of how schools are actually performing,” Kehoe said.
Missouri schools could see new performance incentives under emerging proposal

Currently, the state uses a growth metric that measures teacher effectiveness by comparing students’ growth to an anticipated achievement level. While educators have found the calculations behind the growth model to be confusing, the metric is lauded as highly effective at identifying schools that are helping students progress.
Kehoe and Diehl both propose adding another growth model, one that looks at whether a student is trending toward proficiency within three years.
The label of “proficient” introduces another debate. For two decades, the state has reported standardized test scores in four categories: below basic, basic, proficient and advanced. Lawmakers last year passed a law instructing schools to start reporting grade-level equivalence, which is somewhere between basic and proficient.
State Rep. Brad Pollitt, a Republican from Sedalia who sponsored the bill, said some accused him of trying to “water down” accountability by adding grade-level equivalence.
“That’s not it at all,” he said. “We can’t have conversations in this building without knowing where grade level is.”
The addition of grade-level equivalence will be reflected in performance reports beginning this year.
More transparency measures are coming, state education officials told the committee, with a “refresh” of the education department website planned in March.
“Our goal is to get you to be able to click three times to get to where you want to go,” said Kelli Jones, the department’s deputy commissioner for learning services.
One of Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger’s top priorities is data reporting, telling State Board of Education members in a July retreat that the department “needs to be much better and much more efficient in its data system.”
The department is planning to release a look at the website design later this week, Jones said, telling the committee the rest will be released “as fast as government can work.”

He said “affordability” is the greatest threat and expressed concerns about young people and retirees leaving the state to live elsewhere. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann announced Wednesday afternoon that he is ending his campaign for governor. The announcement comes after President Donald Trump endorsed Schoemann’s rival, U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany Tuesday. 
Schoemann, who launched his campaign about nine months ago, congratulated Tiffany on the endorsement.
“I wish Tom great success in November,” Schoemann said in a statement. “If we focus on the people of Wisconsin rather than fighting with one another, we can make Wisconsin the place to be, not just be from.”
Tiffany, who has represented Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District since 2020, has been considered the frontrunner in the GOP primary race since he entered in September 2025. In recent campaign finance reports, Tiffany outraised Schoemann by nearly $1.5 million.
Schoemann’s exit from the race clears the way for Tiffany to go on to be the Republican nominee in the general election in November. His is the second dropout from the GOP primary. Businessman Bill Berrien dropped out last year shortly after Tiffany joined the race.
Trump announced his endorsement of Tiffany in a Truth Social post on Tuesday evening, saying he has “always been at my side.” Tiffany told WISN-12 that he learned about the endorsement at a dinner and spoke to Schoemann on Wednesday.
“I think the primary is probably behind us,” Tiffany said.
Tiffany said in a statement that he appreciates Schoemann’s words.
“We are both committed to making Wisconsin the place to be,” Tiffany said. “As governor, I will ensure seniors, young families, and the next generation can afford to stay here by lowering property taxes and utility rates, cutting red tape to reduce housing costs and delivering honest government and strong schools for every Wisconsinite.” 
The primary is scheduled for Aug 11. The Democratic primary field remains crowded and includes Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Milwaukee Co. Executive David Crowley, state Sen. Kelda Roys, state Rep. Francesca Hong, former Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. CEO Missy Hughes, former Department of Administration Sec. Joel Brennan. 
The winner of the Democratic primary will likely face Tiffany on Nov. 3.

The program would still have to follow the rules of the purchasing division, an attorney for the committee explained.
The originating bill would require physicians in the state to complete continuing education about nutrition as a part of their licensing requirements. Medical doctors are required to complete 50 hours of continuing education every two years and doctors of osteopathic medicine are required to complete 32 hours of continuing education. The bill would incorporate two hours of continuing education hours on nutrition as a part of those requirements. 
The original version of HB 4740, “Statutory Commitments in Rural Health Transformation Program,’ would have also required the West Virginia Department of Education to incorporate the presidential fitness test into its physical fitness education curriculum. Counsel for the committee said the fitness test has been removed from HB 4740 and and will be part of another bill. 
The Trump administration announced late last year that West Virginia had secured $199 million for 2026 as a part of the Rural Health Transformation Program, which aims to “help states strengthen rural health infrastructure and build enduring systems of care,” according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. 
The program will distribute out $50 billion fund to approved states over the next five years, with $10 billion distributed each year starting fiscal year 2026.
The program was included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which made historic cuts to Medicaid. Hospitals in West Virginia will lose $1 billion per year once the legislation is fully implemented, according to the state hospital association. The $50 billion rural health fund was added to the federal bill to quell concerns the cuts in the Republican megabill would lead to rural hospitals closing. 
According to the state’s application to the federal program, West Virginia aims to use the money to expand telemedicine, address the state’s health care worker shortage and provide patients access to transportation to medical appointments using public buses, rideshare services and volunteer drivers.  
Curtis Capehart, director of policy for Gov. Patrick Morrisey, told the Health Committee Tuesday that West Virginia will be reevaluated over the next five years of the program to determine if it’s meeting the goals of the Rural Health Transformation program. Implementing the changes in the legislation would help the state score higher for future evaluations. 
HB 4740 and the originating bill will next go to the full House of Delegates for consideration.

Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, asked for a deferral on the bill, noting that the bill the amendment was modeled after was scheduled for a subcommittee hearing Thursday. 
“We deserve to follow democracy here, and there is a subcommittee that will be held on it tomorrow to give Iowans time to weigh in on the subject, and I don’t believe we should be voting on something without it being given due process,” Petersen said.

House File 2104, prior to its amendment, would have banned the use of eminent domain for the construction of carbon dioxide pipelines. House lawmakers who passed the bill, and landowners opposed to a carbon sequestration pipeline, argue the original bill is the best way to protect private property rights. 
In a subcommittee hearing on the bill Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, announced at the close that he intended to amend the bill in committee. 
Petersen, who also served on the subcommittee, said the move was a “bait and switch” to Iowa landowners.
Klimesh’s bill, Senate File 2067, and the language in the amendment to the HF 2104, would still allow the use of eminent domain, but only after a hazardous liquid pipeline operator proved it had “diligently exhausted” its possibilities to find willing landowner easements within a widened corridor.  
Klimesh said his bill, and the amendment to House File 2104, “provides a solution” for an issue that has been discussed for the last four years. 
“It would give us the ability to recognize property rights on both sides of this issue,” Klimesh said. 
The amendment was adopted 12-6 with all Democratic committee members dissenting, along with Sen. Dave Rowley, R-Spirit Lake. 
The committee voted 13-5 to advance the amended bill to the Senate floor. Rowley voted to advance the bill, and the committee’s Democratic members again voted against it. 
Rowley, speaking with reporters after the meeting said he voted against the amendment because he “believes in private property rights and no use of eminent domain.” 
“But the reason that I voted yes for the bill itself was because this is such an important issue,” Rowley said. “… At least the bill that (it) was replaced (with), the new bill, that will give us the opportunity to get involved in that discussion even further.”

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A defense company plans to invest $1.3 billion into the Pine Bluff Arsenal, the Army announced Wednesday.
The Army will lease property to Virginia-based Hanwha Defense USA to build and operate a new munitions facility at Pine Bluff Arsenal, which will “modernize the U.S. munitions supply chain and enhance warfighter lethality,” according to an Army news release. 
The lease was awarded through an “enhanced use” program that allows the Army to lease underused property to private partners, with the option to reinvest proceeds into critical infrastructure. The agreement is pending final lease negotiations.
“This partnership with Hanwha is a model that the Army will use to further strengthen and build a modern commercial and organic industrial base,” said Brent Ingraham, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology.
Last year, members of Arkansas’ congressional delegation sent a letter to Army Secretary Dan Driscoll expressing opposition to plans to potentially downsize the Pine Bluff Arsenal. 
The new project is expected to create around 200 jobs in the region. Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman said he’s confident the state’s skilled workforce is prepared to support this venture. 
“Pine Bluff Arsenal is a vital national security asset and this new chapter will build on its important contributions,” Boozman said. 
U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton also praised the announcement. 
“This investment will mean more jobs in the greater Pine Bluff region and more tools for our men and women in uniform,” he said in a news release. 
This partnership will bring the manufacturing of essential ingredients for explosives and propellants to the United States, “a critical step in strengthening the nation’s defense organic industrial base,” according to the Army’s release.   
“Not only will this project introduce advanced manufacturing technologies, but it will create skilled jobs in the region and position Hanwha to support follow-on U.S. Army contracts,” Hanwha Defense USA Chief Operating Officer Mike Smith said in a news release.
Army officials said negotiations will conclude in the coming months. Hanwha Defense USA is a subsidiary of South Korea based Hanwha Aerospace.

Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, is recognized on the Washington state Senate floor on Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2026, in Olympia. (Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse said Wednesday that “a lot of questions need to be answered” in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, but stopped short of calling for new leadership at the Department of Homeland Security. 
Newhouse, a Republican from Sunnyside, was in Olympia speaking to the state House and Senate Republican caucuses. 
The congressman, who isn’t running for reelection this year, told the Standard he sees signs the administration is “turning the corner a little bit” and figuring out a new strategy with a “different tone.” He said he agreed with President Donald Trump’s initial push to deport the so-called “worst of the worst” who have committed violent crimes. 
But it’s clear that federal immigration authorities have gone beyond that, Newhouse said, arguing “things have gotten out of hand.”
“I’m all for border security and getting rid of the bad people,” Newhouse said. “But we have to show some humanity.”
Newhouse didn’t say that embattled Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem needs to be replaced. Her agency oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. He said that, following Pretti’s killing by federal agents Saturday, he’d “like to hear what she has to say” in congressional hearings.
A growing number of House Democrats, including several from Washington’s congressional delegation, are pushing to impeach Noem after the shooting of Pretti. 
Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, is among them.
 “The American people are demanding accountability for these horrific acts,” she said in a statement Monday. “Accountability needs to start with Secretary Noem. It’s clear that the administration and Republicans in Congress are unwilling to hold ICE and its leadership accountable.”
U.S. House Democratic leadership said Tuesday that Noem should be fired or impeached. Two Republican senators, Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, recently called for Noem’s ouster.
Newhouse drew blowback from other Republicans because he supported Trump’s impeachment after the president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. But in Trump’s second term, Newhouse, like most Republicans in Congress, has avoided criticizing the president. 
Several GOP candidates are seeking to replace Newhouse in his safely red central Washington congressional district. They include state Sen. Matt Boehnke, past candidate Jerrod Sessler and Yakima County Commissioner Amanda McKinney, who are all Republicans. Trump has endorsed McKinney in this race, and Sessler in his 2024 challenge of Newhouse. 
Newhouse declined to pick a favored successor Wednesday, noting that there are “good people that are running.”
As for issues he’s watching in Olympia this legislative session, Newhouse, a farmer, said last year’s Democratic-backed tax increases are worsening affordability for state residents. He’s generally focused on trying to improve the economic climate for businesses. 
He previously served four terms in the state House in the 2000s before then-Gov. Christine Gregoire appointed him to lead the state Department of Agriculture.

(Screengrab: NCDPI video stream)  When Anaston Lassiter graduates in May from Hertford County Early College High School, she will leave with more than a high school diploma. She is set to finish with a business certificate and associate degrees in science and the arts.
Lassiter was among the students spotlighted Wednesday as North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction Maurice “Mo” Green joined other education leaders to launch a six-week campaign called “Find Your Fit, Build Your Future.”
State officials said the campaign is meant to draw attention to the range of public school options available to families statewide.
“When families think about school choice, they often don’t realize just how much choice already exists in public education,” Green said.
Republican lawmakers have expanded the state’s private school voucher program, known as Opportunity Scholarships, in recent years as enrollment in charter schools has grown steadily.
Supporters of the voucher program say families need more options. Critics argue the shift diverts money and attention from traditional public schools, particularly in rural and low-income communities.
Asked about declining enrollment in traditional public schools, Green said the shift was a predictable result of expanded choices.
“Anytime you offer more opportunities, some families are going to choose differently,” he said. “Where almost all families were once limited to district public schools, those choices have to come from somewhere.”
Green said the campaign is meant to steer families toward traditional public school options and that increased funding could help reverse enrollment declines.
“With more funding and more visibility, I believe more families will continue to choose public schools,” he said.
North Carolina now has more than 200 charter schools serving about 158,000 students.
Ashley Logue, executive director of the state’s Office of Charter Schools, said charter schools are often misunderstood.
“Charter schools are tuition-free public schools operated by independent nonprofit boards,” Logue said. “They have the flexibility to create specialized programs that meet the unique needs of individual students.”
Trey Michael, a state official who oversees career and technical education programs, said students who complete a full sequence of CTE courses graduate at a 98% rate and often leave high school with industry credentials and college credit.
Jovonia Lewis of Durham said the range of programs allowed her to tailor schooling for her three sons, who have attended magnet, Montessori and early college programs.
“We chose North Carolina public schools because we wanted our sons educated in a place that reflects our community,” Lewis said.
North Carolina has 229 magnet programs, 138 early college high schools and 211 charter schools.
Officials said the campaign launched to coincide with National School Choice Week will run through the end of February.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Green9032025c.jpg,,,2026-01-28 16:58:20.924537

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderATLANTA — Officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the Fulton County elections warehouse Wednesday. 
A court order signed by Magistrate Judge Catherine M. Salinas authorized agents to seize all physical ballots from the 2020 election in Fulton County, all ballot images and Fulton County’s 2020 voter rolls. A copy of the order was given to the Recorder by a Georgia lawmaker.
The Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center is located in Union City, just south of Atlanta.
“We are aware of the ongoing law enforcement activity involving the FBI at the Fulton County warehouse,” said Cae’Lenthya Moore, the executive assistant to Fulton County Clerk Ché Alexander. “At this time, we are only aware of activities involving the warehouse location.”
Officials at the FBI’s field office in Atlanta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In December, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Fulton County for refusing to turn over voter records from the 2020 election. Alexander previously denied Justice Department officials’ request for the data, according to the lawsuit, stating that the records were under seal and could not be released without a court order. She later filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.
The Justice Department has also filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger seeking Georgia’s unredacted voter data. 
Trump has long claimed — without evidence — that the 2020 election was stolen in Georgia and other swing states, blaming his loss on unfounded accusations of rampant voting fraud, even though two recounts affirmed former President Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia. Last week, in a speech before the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump once again claimed that the 2020 election was rigged and said that the individuals involved “will soon be prosecuted for what they did.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte, speaking to reporters Wednesday, said her team asked the White House and the Department of Homeland Security about reports that an immigration detention center is planned for Merrimack. Ayotte said there was no confirmation that the federal government plans to open a facility there, but ultimately she “did not get an answer to my question.”
“But I made quite clear, both to the Department of Homeland Security as well as to the White House,” Ayotte said, “that I thought it was critical that there be full information provided to Merrimack and that local officials be given the opportunity (to be) consulted and to weigh in, and that that local voice was very, very important before that facility went there, because of the impact you can imagine on emergency services and traffic in the area, all the things that you can imagine that locals should weigh in on.”
In late December, The Washington Post, citing leaked DHS documents, reported that Merrimack is one of 23 sites across the United States where the Trump administration plans to build a new immigrant detention facility to assist with its aggressive deportation campaign. The plan reportedly involves building a network of detention centers of smaller feeder facilities — like the one reportedly planned in Merrimack — where immigrants awaiting deportation will be held before being transferred to one of several larger facilities.
The reports have sparked outrage and confusion in Merrimack. Protests have taken place in Merrimack and Concord where demonstrators decried the plans, as well as the administration’s broader deportation agenda, as cruel and unjust. The Merrimack Town Council sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem opposing the facility on the grounds that it would reduce the town’s tax revenue because the federal government is exempt from local property taxes and that it would cause unrest.
Ayotte said the state doesn’t have any levers to stop the federal government from placing a facility in Merrimack beyond her administration’s communicating with federal officials.
Minneapolis shooting
Ayotte also reacted to the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen protesting federal agents in Minneapolis, by federal immigration officers Saturday. 
“Any loss of life is tragic, and I think we can all agree on that,” she said. “It’s my hope that there will be a thorough investigation conducted and that there will be transparency around the results of that investigation. That’s what we would do if there was an officer-involved shooting in New Hampshire.”
She emphasized the need for an investigation.
“People seem to be wanting to make conclusions from the sidelines,” Ayotte said. “From my perspective, whatever your view of it, it’s very important that we get all the facts and circumstances. That’s what an investigation is for. And so I hope that that is conducted.”

(Photo courtesy of Maine Conservation Voters)Lawmakers in Maine moved forward with a climate superfund proposal that was designed to hold fossil fuel companies accountable.
On Wednesday, the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee voted 8-4 to advance LD 1870 to the whole legislative body for a vote. It will first go to the Maine Senate. The proposal would establish a superfund for large fossil fuel companies to pay for infrastructure repairs, resiliency efforts and other costs in the rural and low-income communities disproportionately affected by flooding and other disasters.
The bill was first introduced last year, but was carried over to the current session to give time for lawsuits surrounding similar programs in other states including Vermont and New York time to play out. 
Melanie Loyzim, commissioner of the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, told the committee Wednesday that she estimated it would cost $4 million to fully implement the program. She also said it would require additional staff, though the exact number would depend on the specific plan. 
Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland) asked Loyzim how much the state has spent on storm recovery in recent years. Loyzim estimated that the state has spent $100 million in the past few years for storm recovery as well as implementing resiliency efforts, including a bipartisan climate resiliency law that passed last year. 
Pointing to that figure, some committee members argued the cost of implementation would save taxpayers money in the long term by preventing them from paying for future recovery costs. However, some Republicans said they would like to see more documentation to back up the $100 million estimate. 
Rep. Mike Soboleski (R-Phillips) and Sen. Joseph Martin (R-Oxford) questioned whether climate change is impacted by human interference, despite wide scientific consensus, arguing that the climate always varies and there have been severe weather events over the past century. They voted against the bill, expressing concern that it could lead to higher heating and gas costs. 
The vote came after advocates, as well as state and municipal leaders, held a rally at the State House Tuesday in support of the measure.
“Taxpayers in cities like mine are on the hook for tens of millions of dollars to pay for climate resilience and adaptation projects, cleaning up a mess we didn’t cause,” said Jean Guzzetti, a Bath City Councilor who helped lead the effort last fall to pass a municipal resolution to support the establishment of a Maine Climate Superfund.
Sarah Woodbury, legislative director for Maine Conservation Voters called LD 1870 “an innovative, forward-looking bill that would help futureproof our state and protect our people and communities from the impacts of climate change.”

The Boston Indicators report found that nearly 7,000 housing units are now in the permitting, construction or occupancy pipeline across more than 100 projects in 34 eastern Massachusetts communities as a direct result of zoning changes adopted under the 2021 law. 
The analysis, authored by Boston Indicators Senior Fellow Amy Dain, focuses on projects linked to local compliance with the requirement that cities and towns served by the MBTA allow multifamily housing by right.
“Construction is happening as a direct result of the MBTA Communities law, but the law’s hallmark flexibility leaves a lot of leeway for communities to embrace or sidestep the law’s housing goals,” Dain said. “As a result, while MBTA Communities has been the most effective state policy in recent years to encourage multi-family housing by right, its impacts in some areas, especially near transit stations, have been relatively modest compared to the overwhelming need.”
The 7,000 units tied to MBTA Communities zoning represent a small slice of the housing push underway statewide. In her state of the commonwealth address, Gov. Maura Healey said the number of homes “built, permitted or under construction” across Massachusetts has surpassed 100,000 over the past three years.
“Experts said that we had to build about 220,000 homes by 2035. I’m telling you right now, we’re not just going to meet that, we’re going to beat it,” Healey said. “We’ve already in three years got 100,000 new homes built, permitted or under construction, and more are on the way.”
While the MBTA Communities Act was designed in part to steer housing growth toward transit, the report shows that only about 30 percent of the units in the current pipeline are located within a half-mile of train stations. 
Dain notes that state guidelines allow communities without developable land near stations to site their multifamily districts elsewhere, and many projects still have access to town centers, bus service, or bike infrastructure that supports multimodal travel.
The data also underscore how heavily production is concentrated in a small number of large developments. 
Just 19 projects with more than 100 units each account for roughly three-quarters of all MBTA Communities housing in the pipeline. 
According to the report, 34 municipalities have projects in the pipeline, ranging in size from two to more than 500 units. Dain writes that for small-scale projects to add up to the tens of thousands of homes the region needs, communities would have to allow more building within MBTA Communities districts or expand zoning beyond the law’s minimum requirements.
Luc Schuster, executive director of Boston Indicators, said the law’s design has shaped those outcomes.
“MBTA Communities was never going to be the single solution to our region’s housing needs, but its progress could set the stage for continued development and the crafting of new, more ambitious efforts to provide housing for families in and around transit moving forward,” Schuster said.
Even as projects move forward, enforcement of the zoning law remains a live issue on Beacon Hill. 
As of early January, 165 of the 177 cities and towns covered by the statute had adopted compliant zoning or received interim or conditional approval from the state. Twelve communities — Carver, Dracut, East Bridgewater, Freetown, Halifax, Holden, Marblehead, Middleton, Rehoboth, Tewksbury, Wilmington and Winthrop — remain out of compliance after deadlines that fell in mid-2025 or at the end of last year.
A response from Attorney General Andrea Campbell could come in the next few days.
“We are on top of this right now,” Campbell said this month on GBH Radio. “We gave folks to the end of January, based on our guidance last year, to come into compliance. And those that do not, we will take action as appropriate by the end of the month.”
That July advisory to noncompliant communities said “in January 2026, the Attorney General is prepared to bring an enforcement suit against any MBTA Community that has failed to both adopt the required zoning and apply for a determination of district compliance from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities.”
Campbell’s office has emphasized that rezoning is only an initial step toward construction, but one the state views as essential. 
With the law marking its five-year anniversary this month, the report suggests that while MBTA Communities has begun to change the zoning landscape, translating that shift into housing at the scale Massachusetts needs remains a work in progress.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/condos.webp?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-28 16:58:20.924537

Ashley Perry, a leader with Indivisible Downriver United 734, called on both senators to “stand firm” as the deadline to pass the bill approaches.
“Our big concern is that, last time this happened, eight senators buckled, and it was all for nothing because the healthcare vote came and went and nothing’s come of it,” Perry said, referring to the holdout by Congressional Democrats last fall around the expiration of Affordable Care Act tax credits. “When it comes to this, we don’t want the money to go through, because we don’t want this in our city, we don’t want it in any other city and we want it out of Minnesota and everywhere else.”

The Homeland Security funding package, which totals $64.4 billion, was on track to pass with five other spending bills, until the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis by ICE agents — the second such killing in Minnesota since the start of 2026 — sparked a number of Senate Democrats to come out against the DHS funding. 
Representatives from both Peters’s and Slotkin’s offices came to talk with protesters, who included Indivisible chapters from Western Wayne, Huron Valley and around the metro Detroit area.
“It lets us know that we’re being heard,” Perry said. ”They understand our concerns, and that means a lot to us because we do know how hard our senators and their office works.”
Angel White and Lee Yzquierdo, two of the protesters who spoke with representatives from Slotkin’s office, also emphasized that they were grateful to the office staff for having conversations with them.  
“That felt really good, that they are listening to us even when we can’t get through the phone,” Yzquierdo, who said they have been met with a full voicemail box when trying to call Slotkin’s office, said.

Many of the attendees carried signs and chanted protest slogans calling for the total abolition of ICE as an agency — calls for which have only increased since the killings of Renee Good on Jan. 7 and Pretti on Jan. 24.
“I’m appalled at the violence of ICE and I don’t think anybody is fooled any longer that this is about immigration,” Sherri Masson, a leader for Indivisible Huron Valley, said. “This is about instilling fear into communities.”

Masson expressed her appreciation that both senators have said they won’t vote for additional funding. However, she continued, she also wants her senators to know that she believes ICE should be abolished. 
“They’ve already been funded beyond what they need to do any kind of immigration enforcement, which is not what they’re doing,” she continued. “We are here opposed entirely to ICE and the work that they’re doing. We’re here to ask our senators to stand up, even if it means shutting the government down because this is a time they have the opportunity, the leverage in the Senate now, to make that happen, and we want them to stand firm.”
Lawren Juip, a protester outside Slotkin’s office, called a vote against the DHS funding bill “the bare minimum” for Slotkin and Peters to do in standing up to ICE. 
“I think ICE needs to be abolished. It’s younger than I am. You don’t need it,” she said. “I don’t think that the department as it exists today could be meaningfully reformed into something better.”

Around Detroit, organizations around the city and beyond are sharing similar calls for legislators to block continued funding for ICE. 
“This murder does not exist in isolation. It reflects a broader and deeply troubling pattern of violence carried out through government systems that Black, brown, and immigrant communities have been experiencing for generations,” Danielle Atkinson, executive director of Detroit-based nonprofit Mothering Justice, wrote in a press release. “As elected officials debate the future of ICE and Department of Homeland Security funding, this moment demands accountability, oversight, and honesty about the real human costs of these policies. More importantly, communities most impacted by ICE and DHS’s violence must be centered in any discussion about public safety, family well-being, and justice.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_3985-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 16:58:20.924537

Maggie Nurrenbern is introduced to the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri senators debated a bill Wednesday that would impose age limits on kratom sales and ban 7-OH products, as lawmakers raised concerns about the drug’s opioid-like effects and growing availability.
The name, 7-OH, is short for 7-hydroxymitragynine, and it’s made by chemically converting and concentrating the main opioid-inducing element in kratom. 7-OH is sold as gummies, candies, imitation ice cream cones, liquid shots, tablets and powders. People can buy it in Missouri smoke shops, gas stations, convenience stores and online shops. 
Members of the Senate Judiciary and Civil and Criminal Jurisprudence Committee heard support for a ban from physicians and opioid-addiction specialists who argued 7-OH products can lead to addiction. These drugs should be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and prescribed by a doctor, they said. 
Opposition largely came from those suffering from chronic pain who testified the FDA-approved medication that’s available has bad side effects, unlike 7-OH, which they say has improved their lives. 
Missouri Democratic Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern of Kansas City said several families submitted statements to the committee regarding how these “highly addictive, unregulated drugs” have impacted their loved ones and children.
“I don’t know if there’s any more pressing issue before us than making sure that kids don’t have access to these drugs,” Nurrenbern told the committee on Wednesday morning, “as well as making sure that we’re not doing further damage to our community right now that’s already grappling with so much in terms of addiction and mental health.” 
The bill prohibits the preparation, distribution, advertisement or sale of a kratom product to a person under 21, that mimics candy or is appealing to children. It bans combustible products or vapes and any products that contain more than 2% of 7-OH.
It requires disclaimers on labels and that products be stored behind a counter or where they can’t be accessed by people under 21. A person who violates this provision will be deemed in violation of the state’s Merchandising Practices Act and could face a Class E felony.
A representative from Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway’s office said Wednesday that the bill would strengthen enforcement authority. Last year, Hanaway launched an investigation into 11 makers and sellers of 7-OH products for violating the Merchandising Practices Act.
“We expect to share more in the coming months,” said Dan Engemann, Hanaway’s director of policy and outreach. “We do plan to bring cases, protecting Missourians from MMPA violations relating to this drug.”
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services issued a health advisory last year as well, warning consumers of potential health risks it says are associated with 7-OH. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters in June to six manufacturers of 7-OH, and federal action is still pending. The companies the FDA targeted are different from the ones Hanaway is investigating, except for one.
Kansas-City-based Shaman Botanicals LLC — the leading supplier of 7-OH in Missouri — received letters from both the FDA and Hanaway.
Shaman Botanicals LLC’s White Vein plant-based alkaloid tablets contain 3.75mg of 7-OH each (Screenshot of the product page on CBD American Shaman’s website).
The company’s owner, Vince Sanders, told senators Wednesday that Shaman was the first company to make 7-OH products in 2023. Traditional opioid-related deaths, largely from fentanyl, had been on the rise since 2016, he said, until he began making and selling 7-OH products.
“If you overlay that with the presence of 7-OH on the market, it is a hand and a glove fit, as these products came to market in 2023,” Sanders said. “In ‘24, they dropped dramatically. In ‘25, they dropped dramatically. If my conclusion is correct – and I honestly stake my life on that it is – there’s 70,000-plus people walking the earth right now that wouldn’t be.” 
He argued studies he funded using beagles and rodents show the products are safe. The studies, he previously told The Independent, were completed as an attempt to earn FDA approval. 
Jeff Smith, a lobbyist for the nonprofit research group Holistic Alternative Recovery Trust, said the group agrees with most regulations in the bill but opposes the 2% limit on 7-OH, arguing it would only encourage dangerous workarounds. Scientists use the potency of a substance based on its milligrams, he said, not percentage. 
“So if you wanted to game this system, under the current proposal, you could put together a capsule that’s got 20 milligrams of 7-OH and 981 milligrams of mitragynine,” Smith said. “And I would not advise anyone to take a pill with that, but it would be legal under this proposal.”
Smith added that the group, which is funded by Sanders, fears the bill could legalize a myriad of potential dangerous products.
The bill received support from kratom advocacy groups, including Global Kratom Coalition and the American Kratom Association, who have pushed for removing 7-OH from the marketplace. 
Natural kratom products and 7-OH are different because of the concentration of 7-OH, said Tom Dempsey, lobbyist for the association. He compared it to extracting caffeine out of the coffee bean, concentrating it, and then putting it in a product and marketing it as coffee.
“That’s in effect what is happening today,” Dempsey said. 
Smith compared the difference to eating 40 oranges or three gallons of orange juice to get the benefits of vitamin C, instead of taking a vitamin C pill. 
“A businessman in Kansas City kind of figured out a way to pull the most effective part of the plant out and put that into a capsule,” Smith said, adding that he takes them for his own back pain. 
Jennifer Rhoad, director of the youth drug prevention coalition Smithville Community in Action, said the FDA “pulls no punches” when it says 7-OH products could lead to another opioid crisis. And in a town of 11,000 people in Smithville, three stores sell kratom and two stores sell 7-OH products. 
“As somebody who is trying to allocate funds for the after effects of the current opioid crisis, I dramatically want to prevent that from happening,” Rhoad said. “Senate Bill 927…does not ban kratom, but rather regulates it responsibly, protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring product integrity for adult consumers.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010825_nurrenbern1-1024x673.jpg,,,2026-01-28 16:58:20.924537

“The greater impact is on the community and how somebody is treated outside of those chats,” Rutland County NAACP President Mia Schultz said.

A Rutland County sheriff’s deputy was ousted from the department this week after he sent racist text messages, an internal affairs investigation found.
In a group chat with other officers, former deputy Ryder Paskevich sent an image of officers in Klu Klux Klan garments taking Black people into custody, according to a Brady letter sent on Tuesday by Rutland County States Attorney Ian Sullivan. 
Paskevich admitted to the conduct before he was fired on Monday, according to the letter. Paskevich could not be immediately contacted, and his sheriff department email account had already been disabled by Wednesday.
Sullivan sent the Brady letter to the Rutland County defense counsel, including the defense attorneys of cases that the deputy was involved in. The U.S. Constitution requires the prosecution to disclose potentially impeachable evidence to the defense to “ensure that trials are fair (and) that sources of bias or exculpatory evidence can be explored,” Sullivan said. 
Around a half dozen cases Paskevich was involved with have been discharged as of midday Wednesday, Sullivan said. 
“We’ve already begun the process of reviewing cases he was involved in where he is a crucial witness,” Sullivan said. “We’re not anywhere close to done (with) the reviews, so this is affecting cases.”
One of the officers in the image Paskevich sent was depicted making “a statement to the effect of being able to tell they were all guilty by looking at them,” according to the letter. The picture referenced was not included in the letter. After Paskevich sent the image in the group chat, another officer responded, “that is racist and descriminatory [sic.] you bigot asshole,” according to the letter. 
Paskevich deleted the messages, and all officers left the chat, the Brady letter stated. Paskevich’s conduct prompted officers to inform authorities in the department, who launched an investigation.
Rutland County Sheriff David J. Fox was not immediately available for comment Wednesday. 
Paskevich’s messages violated internal department policy and the Vermont Criminal Justice Council’s Law Enforcement Officers’ Code of Conduct, Sullivan wrote in the Brady letter.
Defender General Matt Valerio said he could not speak to Paskevich’s case, but explained that a “Brady letter” — also known as a “Giglio letter” after a U.S. Supreme Court case — marks the “death knell for a law enforcement career.” This is because an officer’s reckless or intentional misconduct is “so egregious that it fundamentally impacts their credibility” in offering testimony in cases and enforcing the law, Valerio said. 
Court cases that include testimony and evidence “material to the heart of the case” from officers with such letters should be dismissed, Valerio said. 
The racist messages Paskevich admitted to run the risk of seeping into decision-making and use of discretion in cases, Rutland County NAACP President Mia Schultz said.
The conduct also “sets us back to rebuilding trust,” which is already fragile between law enforcement and marginalized communities, Schultz said, even as the Vermont Criminal Justice Council and advocates in the state are working to shift the culture around policing. 
Paskevich’s termination and the reevaluation of cases he was involved in are both appropriate first steps to addressing the deputy’s misconduct, Schultz said. Accountability and building community trust, she added, requires ongoing work like continuing independent oversight, regular training and clear standards to establish a law enforcement environment where discriminatory behavior is not tolerated. 
“The greater impact is on the community and how somebody is treated outside of those chats,” Schultz said. “Accountability is not about just removing that person. It’s about asking how this culture is allowed to exist in the first place.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Two separate investigations are underway into the Saturday shooting death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti at the hands of Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis, according to U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-PA). 
During a telephone town hall on Tuesday evening, McCormick said he spoke with senior people in the Department of Homeland Security and was told the probes will be made public in the coming weeks, “which should give us some insight into what happened on the ground in Minneapolis.” 
McCormick described the shooting as a tragedy.
“I don’t understand all the facts of where the gun was and all that stuff, but I certainly think that we need to have a full and transparent investigation to make sure that the public knows because it’s really important that our law enforcement not only protects the public, but keeps its confidence,” McCormick said. “That’s the best way our law enforcement is going to be able to do their jobs well.”
Of the 11 calls McCormick fielded on Tuesday evening, five of them were related to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement funding and law enforcement. Four callers argued against funding ICE. One, however, asked McCormick what can be done to ensure support for law enforcement.

Some also argued that there should be a leadership change at the Department of Homeland Security. U.S. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) on Tuesday, who voted to confirm Kristi Noem as DHS secretary, joined his fellow Democrats in calling for Trump to fire her.
All seven of the Pennsylvania Democrats serving in the U.S. House have signed onto impeachment articles against Noem, although it is unclear if Fetterman supports that action. The effort would need Republican support, since the GOP controls both the House and Senate. 
As of Tuesday evening, GOP U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Tom Tillis (R-NC) had called for Noem to step down. 
“I do think that the ICE mission is an incredibly challenging one and I think there’s ultimately a situation in Minneapolis that’s gotten out of control and I think we need to step back and learn from it and the enforcement mission is still critical, but I also think we want to try to deescalate the situation,” McCormick said. “That appears to be what President Trump and Gov. Walz are doing.”
Pretti, a Veterans Affairs nurse, was shot multiple times by immigration agents during a scuffle that erupted Saturday as he stepped between two women and an agent who was shoving them.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Pretti, who had a pistol holstered in his waistband, “attacked” officers and “brandished” his weapon. But video footage appears to contradict that accusation, and does not show Pretti ever holding the firearm. He had a permit to carry the pistol legally.

Stephen Miller, a top White House aide who previously described Pretti as a “would-be assassin” backpedaled a bit, telling CNN on Tuesday that the Customs and Border Protection team in Minneapolis “may not have been following” proper protocol before the fatal shooting.
A few of McCormick’s GOP colleagues have also called for an investigation into the shooting, while the National Rifle Association, (NRA), which is largely supportive of conservative elected officials, also supports an investigation.
But the Trump administration is starting to face pressure from gun rights groups over comments made by the president and others that Pretti was dangerous because he was carrying a handgun and spare magazines. President Trump twice on Tuesday referred negatively to Pretti legally carrying a pistol. However, groups pointed out it’s common for gun owners with a concealed carry permit to also have extra magazines.
Despite the Minnesota shootings of Pretti and Renee Good, who was killed in her car earlier this month by agents, McCormick supports a DHS funding bill some Democrats are attempting to block. 
“The funding includes Border Patrol, it includes customs agents that you see in your airports, it includes the Coast Guard, and it includes ICE, which, of course, is just one small part of the budget and I do think we should not shut down our government or defund that,” McCormick said.
Prior to Pretti’s shooting death, the U.S. House voted 220-207 to advance the DHS funding bill, which included the support of seven Democrats. Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation voted along party lines, with the 10 Republicans backing it and seven Democrats opposed.

Republicans hold a majority in the U.S. Senate, but even if their delegation is united, they would need several Democrats to vote in support of the bill to reach a 60-vote threshold. But, Democrats have already said they have enough votes to block it.
McCormick predicts there will be some negotiations with Democrats over the spending proposal, but vowed to avoid a partial government shut down. 
“I’m not in favor of ever shutting down the government. It doesn’t matter what party is in power, but some people see that differently,” McCormick said.
Fetterman said he won’t vote against DHS funding, despite the Democratic U.S. House delegation urging him to vote no.

The federal official in charge of a multi-billion-dollar fund to compensate victims of New Mexico’s biggest-ever wildfire received a six-figure payment for smoke damage at his Angel Fire home far from where the fire burned, according to documents obtained by Source New Mexico and New Mexico PBS.
Internal records reveal that Jay Mitchell, who runs the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Claims Office, received roughly $266,000 in compensation last July for smoke and ash cleaning costs for his home and adjacent casita in Angel Fire, a ski resort town more than an hour’s drive from the hardest-hit areas of the 2022 wildfire. 
Mitchell’s wife Lisa, a licensed real estate broker selling property in the Angel Fire area, received additional payments totaling more than $250,000 last August for business-related losses she said she incurred during the fire, according to the documents.

This story was reported and produced in collaboration with NMPBS, a Source New Mexico partner. Look for the station’s broadcast version at 7 p.m., Feb. 6 on channel 5.1.

Because the U.S. Forest Service accidentally ignited the wildfire with two botched prescribed burns, Congress in late 2022 passed the Hermits Peak Fire Assistance Act requiring FEMA to compensate people who lost their homes or livelihoods due to the wildfire or subsequent flooding. The claims office, which is overseeing $5.45 billion in compensation funds, also pays property owners in and around the wildfire perimeter for smoke and ash cleaning costs for both exteriors and interiors.
According to recent estimates from the claims office, 74 individuals or families who lost their homes in the wildfire are still awaiting final compensation offers more than 3 1/2 years after the fire ripped through their communities. 


Mitchell and his wife did not respond to multiple recent requests for comment from Source New Mexico, including phone calls and text messages. Source NM attempted to contact Mitchell at his Santa Fe office and his Angel Fire home. At his home, Mitchell slammed the door after shouting an expletive at reporters for approaching him at his “private residence,” and his wife accused reporters of “harassing” her.
Adán Serna, communications director for U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), told Source that while he had no first-hand knowledge of the Mitchells’ payout, “It would be deeply disappointing and shows the need for greater transparency from FEMA. The senator, Serna said, “has repeatedly called for greater transparency, improved processes, and faster claims decisions. That is the sole purpose of the Claims Office: to get money out the door to people who need it. It must also answer to Congress. Unfortunately, FEMA has failed to meet those standards.”
Less than 1,000 feet from the boundary line
FEMA named Mitchell as its new director of the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon claims office in April of 2024. A native New Mexican, Mitchell previously served as director of the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management under Gov. Susana Martinez. He took over the claims office at a time of deep public dissatisfaction among fire victims and public officials over delays in distributing funds.

Mitchell also began work one month after the claims office rolled out its smoke compensation program.
Mitchell applied for smoke damage compensation in July 2024, and indicated in his application that he needed the payout to clean his two-story, 4,800-square-foot home and a 1,700-square-foot casita with an attached two-car garage. Recent tax records value the Mitchells’ home at about $785,000. 
On July 15, 2024, Mitchell signed FEMA’s application, which requires signatories to affirm under threat of perjury that they are telling the truth that the “reported structures, contents, and need for smoke, ash, and soot cleaning on this worksheet is true and correct.”
It’s unclear how much smoke Angel Fire experienced during the wildfire, which burned primarily in nearby Mora and San Miguel counties. Last week, Source New Mexico visited Mitchell’s neighborhood, which features numerous million-dollar houses, most of them vacation rentals, tucked between aspens and Ponderosa pines on a hillside overlooking the Angel Fire Country Club. 
Two year-round homeowners along the winding dirt road through Mitchell’s neighborhood, Michael Martinez and Dan Brown, in separate interviews said they were paying close attention to the fire during spring and early summer of 2022. They said they remember a few days during which they could smell smoke, but said that it did not cause any discoloration or damage to their homes or to those of anyone they know.
“We didn’t have any smoke damage,” Brown said in an interview at his home. “Now, sometimes you could smell it. Sometimes you were breathing some of it, but not heavily.”
Michael Martinez, who lives within a half mile of Mitchell, told Source and NMPBS that smoke was never bad in the neighborhood during the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. (Cailley Chella/NM PBS)
Martinez, who lives a half mile northeast of Mitchell, told Source that, “There was no smoke damage to my house at all. We never had a day where smoke was that bad coming in. We have pictures of it just blooming up over to the south of us, but never anything that really hit our neighborhood.”
According to a Source New Mexico analysis of the map officials consult when approving smoke damage payments, Mitchell’s home is less than 1,000 feet from a boundary line demarcating a roughly 2,200-square-mile zone in which claimants need only to sign a declaration form to receive smoke compensation payments.  
Had he lived on the other side of the line, Mitchell would have been required to provide additional proof of smoke damage or discoloration as part of his claim, including photos, a site inspection or invoices for professional cleaning.


Burn scar victims left behind
After FEMA rolled out payments for smoke damage, the category quickly became one of the most expensive areas of loss the office paid out. By September 2024, the office had cut checks for $393.8 million in smoke and ash damage claims to 4,168 claimants, which works out to an average of $94,500 each. That was more than one-third of the total compensation the office had released to fire victims at that time. 
Meanwhile, concerns grew among survivors and elected officials that even as it released huge sums of money, the office was leaving behind people who lost the most in the fire.
Those people reside in what victims refer to as the “burn scar,” the 534-square-mile wildfire that contains multiple communities. It stretches from outside of Las Vegas, through Rociada and other hard-hit areas to south of Taos. The fire destroyed more than 900 homes within that boundary, in addition to livelihoods and forestland. 
Luján posted on social media in May of 2024 that he had met with Mitchell “on behalf of impacted New Mexicans” and emphasized the importance of “prioritizing people with total home loss.”
But those concerns continued into 2025 and in January of that year, Yolanda Cruz, a fire victim who moderates a Facebook page for fellow neighbors still navigating the recovery process, and Luján’s office pushed for a meeting with Mitchell to hear directly from those who had lost their homes. 
According to Cruz’s notes, which Source NM reviewed, at the meeting, Mitchell committed to prioritizing compensation to fire victims living in the burn scar, and particularly those who lost their homes.

Serna from Lujan’s office said Wednesday that Mitchell, at a late January meeting last year, reiterated that commitment. Luján’s office “has repeatedly pressed FEMA for updates on that commitment and has received insufficient responses,” Serna said. 
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District where the fire hit hardest, said in a statement provided to Source NM that her office continues to hear from constituents “who are desperate for answers and aren’t getting responses, and every week of delay means more suffering for families.”
In an interview last week at her home in Sapello, Cruz sat on her living room couch and reviewed the records of the Mitchells’ payments, a picture window behind her revealing the charred remains of acres of trees. 
She said she felt betrayed to see that Jay Mitchell would agree to receive any funds for himself. She said he had an obligation, even if he was technically eligible for compensation, to ask for his claim to be put “on the back burner” until everyone in the wildfire perimeter was compensated. 
“It is really disheartening and disturbing that he received this,” she said, holding a document showing the $266,000 payment for smoke damage.

She rattled off names of people who live in the direct path of where the fire burned and are still waiting: her friends, the Silvas, whose adult children lost their home and had to move with young grandkids into their trailer. Their neighbor: a mechanic waiting on business compensation and funds to pay for equipment the fire melted. Down the road, Cruz has a neighbor who has since moved to near Albuquerque after losing her home and also has yet to be compensated. Then there’s the diner owner in Las Vegas who had to shut down for months. 
“Jay Mitchell has not been honest with people. He is not putting the people in the burn scar first, like he said he would,” she said. 
On a tour later of her scorched property, Cruz pointed to signs of progress in her family’s recovery. Her family has been able to remove the vehicles the fire destroyed, as well her granddaughter’s playground that it liquefied. 
Her son had just completed downing hazard trees at the top of the hill, she noted, leaving the hilltop barren of trees and covered with blackened sawdust. Despite the lack of vegetation, deer visit her daily, she said. 
As she walked slowly back down the hill toward her home, she stayed upright by placing her hands on the bark of scorched trees. By the time she reached the bottom, her hands were coated with soot.
“This always happens,” she said, wiping the soot off her hands onto her pants.

The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota has sparked furious backlash. Protests have been held around the country following the killing by federal agents of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott characterized the immigration raids as “a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that’s resulting in the murder of Americans.”
Last week, a group of over a dozen Vermont faith leaders responded to a national call for clergy to come to Minneapolis to bear witness and support besieged local religious leaders. On this Vermont Conversation, I spoke with two Vermont clergy who have just returned from a tumultuous and emotional trip to Minneapolis. Rabbi David Fainsilber is the rabbi of the Jewish Community of Greater Stowe, and Rev. Dr. Becca Girrell is the pastor of United Community Church of Morrisville.
“Minneapolis is serving as a testing ground. That is true both for the operations of ICE and Border Patrol and other federal enforcement (using) pretty brutal tactics, but it’s also true of the community response and resilience,” said Rev. Girrell. “What moved me and stays with me the most is the way in which the people of Minneapolis are drawing together peacefully and legally and in strong solidarity and support.”
Rev. Girrell said that the brutal tactics of federal agents are “meant as a warning to people like me, to people of good faith or no faith all around the country, that we should not stand up for our neighbors, and we should not protect them with ourselves and our very lives if necessary. And what I saw was the people of Minneapolis will not comply with that order.”
Asked whether he saw parallels between the actions of federal agents in the U.S. and how immigrants were rounded up in Nazi Germany, Rabbi Fainsilber said the link wasn’t necessary. “You don’t need to look far to see slavery, to see genocide. Let’s look in our own backyard here and our history to make the point that today is not okay. What is happening feels like a direct line from American history to today.”
Fainsilber added that it is “time for people to raise their voices, to not sit on the sidelines, … to make sure that there’s legal accountability when officers kill civilians, that there’s no additional federal funding for ICE right now, for corporations to become Fourth Amendment businesses so that they’re not aiding and abetting ICE activity.”
Rev. Girrell returned from Minnesota with a warning. “The violence we see in Minneapolis may come here to Vermont. But the strength of community resilience is already here, and we continue to build that, and we continue to know our neighbors well, so that if there is a crisis, we can respond immediately, and we can respond with strength and love for our neighbors.”

The legislation would give local governmentss allow the removal of a member of a library board by a two-thirds vote of a governing body.
The bill comes as conservatives and right-wing organizations in Alabama continue to target library books, particularly those with LGBTQ+ themes. The Alabama Public Library Service Board last year approved a ban on books with “gender ideology,” a broad term it does not define. Earlier this month, the board voted to withhold state funds from the Fairhope Public Library over the placement of books like “The Handmaid’s Tale” in a teen section.
Read Freely Alabama, a nonprofit that opposes the recent restrictions, said in a statement that the bill was “blatantly designed to wrest decision-making authority from local library boards and put it in the hands of politicians.”
“Our libraries have experienced enough political strife already,” the statement said.
Elliott first introduced the bill in 2024, where it got out of a House committee but did not come to a vote. A similar bill filed last year passed the Senate but did not come to a House vote. Representatives from Read Freely Alabama and the Alabama Library Association spoke against the bill at a public hearing Wednesday.
One of their main concerns is language in the bill that states “shall serve at the pleasure of his or her respective appointing authority and may be removed at any time by a two-thirds vote of the appointing authority.”
Currently, city councils and county commissioners cannot remove members of library boards at will according to state statute.
“The cause, literally, could be about anything,” said James Gilbreath, president of the Alabama Library Association.
Speakers also criticized a  provision requiring local library boards to provide a report to the Governor’s Office, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President Pro Tempore of the Senate to review and remove library materials from their collections throughout the year.
Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, introduced an amendment that the committee approved that effectively removed that section of the bill.
Regardless, Elliott continued to advocate for the legislation.
“Guys, these are volunteer appointments,” he said regarding concerns about due process. “This is not a job. This is a volunteer appointment. These folks are not employed; it is not a due process or for cause type of situation.”

The county said in a news release that routine testing after the first sample was detected in the sheriff’s office led to Legionella being identified in the water systems of North Oakland Health Center and the Resource and Crisis Center.
“There are no known cases of Legionnaires’ disease associated with either facility and the risk to employees and the public remains low,” the county said.
Heavy-duty water filters are being installed on all fixtures in those buildings and the county has begun flushing the buildings’ water systems. The incoming water supply for both buildings has tested negative for the bacteria. Other measures, like water temperature monitoring, are also in place, as the bacteria flourishes in warm temperature water.
Routine testing is taking place at the Oakland County Jail, as well, the county said.
The issue at the sheriff’s office, which was reported in early December 2025, caused the building to be temporarily closed while testing and remediation work commenced.

,DC,2026-01-28 21:26:35+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump tries to shift attention away from woes with glitzy Trump Accounts rollout,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-tries-shift-attention-away-woes-glitzy-trump-accounts-rollout,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump touted the coming generation of “Trump Account children” Wednesday as the administration aims to deflect attention from rising food prices and a deadly federal immigration crackdown that in recent weeks took the lives of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.The day-long U.S. Treasury Department event in Washington, D.C., brought together big names from corporate America and entertainment to promote forthcoming tax-deferred investment accounts that will be available to all U.S. children — and that will be seeded with one-time $1,000 contributions from the government for babies born between Jan. 1, 2025 and Dec. 31, 2028.Trump said the accounts, enacted under the massive tax and spending cuts package in July, will be “remembered as one of the most transformative policy innovations of all time.”“Perhaps no provision of the great, big, beautiful bill will prove more consequential than Trump Accounts,” Trump said during his roughly 45-minute speech that included a brief appearance by Grammy-nominated rapper Nicki Minaj, who has become an advocate for the policy.Higher birth rateAhead of the president’s remarks, panel speakers, including White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell, framed the policy as celebratory of this year’s 250th birthday of the United States, and as a carrot to encourage a higher birth rate.“Today and forevermore, every child born in America becomes a shareholder in America,” said Brad Gerstner, founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital, a California-based tech investment firm.The Treasury event, titled the “Trump Accounts Summit,” came one day after Trump delivered remarks on the economy in Iowa, where he told voters, “I hope you remember us for the midterms.”An interest-bearing account for American children has drawn bipartisan support. U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., touted his own such proposal in late 2018, bringing the idea to the 2020 presidential campaign trail. Booker’s “American Opportunity Account” bill proposed $1,000 seed money from the government, with up to $2,000 in annual contributions per child, depending on a family’s income level.In May, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, with the backing of Dell and Gerstner,  proposed similar accounts for every child born in the U.S. to be seeded with $1,000 from the government. Cruz attended Wednesday’s event and received public recognition from the president.Launch coming in JulyThe Trump Accounts, as named in the law, are set to launch July 5, according to the White House website, TrumpAccounts.gov. While the accounts will legally belong to a minor, they can only be managed by a parent or guardian until a child’s 18th birthday. Parents and guardians will need to elect to open the account during tax filing season or via a government portal scheduled to launch this summer.The accounts are structured like a traditional individual retirement account, but with different investment features and restrictions.Annual contributions from parents and guardians, as well as their employers, are capped at $5,000 per year. Parents can elect to divert pre-tax contributions from their paychecks directly into their child’s account. Employers can match up to $2,500.Trump told the crowd Wednesday that “dozens of major employers have signed up to add the Trump account contributions to their employee benefit packages, including Uber, Schwab, Charter Communications and many, many others.”The government’s $1,000 seed money as well as contributions from state and local governments, and 501(c)3 organizations, will not count toward the $5,000 annual cap.The most high-profile foundation contribution to date has come from Dell, and his wife Susan, who pledged last month to give $250 to children up to age 10 who were born before the time window to receive the government seed money. The money is targeted to children in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000, Dell said Wednesday.Trump said other companies announced “really big contributions” Wednesday, including Intel, Nvidia, Broadcom, IBM, Steak and Shake, Coinbase, Continental Resources and Comcast.William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, told States Newsroom during an interview Tuesday that while specific federal guidance is still emerging, direct charitable contributions to individual investment accounts are “pretty much a completely new concept in the tax code.”The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit that describes itself as nonpartisan, advocates for economic growth and simpler tax policies.Some exceptions to penaltyThe accounts are bound by certain restrictions, including a prohibition on withdrawals until age 18, when the account essentially becomes an individual retirement account subject to tax penalties for early withdrawal before age 59.5.Penalty-free exceptions include accessing the cash for a first-home purchase, up to $10,000; birth or child adoption fees up to $5,000; and qualifying medical expenses.“It's aimed at trying to get families to save and grow that balance,” said Rita Assaf, vice president of retirement offerings for Fidelity Investments.“But for those that need flexibility of cash, this is where maybe that account, depending on your goal, may not be a right account for you. For day-to-day, or, some sort of big event needs before age 18, that's where you might want to consider other accounts,” Assaf told States Newsroom in an interview Tuesday.Other restrictions on the account include types of investments. Eligible investments include mutual funds or exchange traded funds, or ETFs, that track the returns of large American companies, for example the S&P 500 index.A child’s account that receives the maximum family and employer contributions of $5,000 at the start of each year could grow to nearly $200,000 by age 18, assuming a 7% annual rate of return, according to a Fidelity Investment hypothetical example, not adjusted for inflation. If a child qualified for the $1,000 government seed money, and a parent left it untouched until age 18, the White House estimates the former minor would have $5,800 upon reaching adulthood, assuming historical returns for the S&P 500.McBride said that while several specifics remain unclear, the accounts have “a lot of potential” and that advocates hope children from varying socioeconomic levels become more engaged in the process of creating wealth, learning how to invest money, and manage money.“I'd say it has huge upside, and it just remains to be seen if it will actually catch on and become a way to sort of encourage a broader swath of society to participate in the benefits of capitalism, if you will.”",,,,2026-01-28 16:58:20.924537

(Courtesy of the New Jersey Department of Agriculture)Farmworkers who say they are unfairly excluded from overtime and minimum wage laws can continue to fight their claims in court, a state Superior Court judge said Wednesday.
El Comité de Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agrícolas, a grassroots group known as CATA that advocates for farmworkers, sued three high-ranking state officials in 2024, including the attorney general, over their claims, and in a 30-page opinion released Wednesday, Judge Patrick J. Bartels denied the state’s bid to dismiss the complaint.
Jessica Cully, general coordinator at CATA, called the ruling the “beginning of vindicating the rights of farmworkers” who have faced decades of unfair pay.
“Especially in this moment, when immigrant communities are being brutalized across the country and our local communities experience raids on a nearly weekly basis, New Jersey must begin treating farmworkers with the same dignity and respect it affords similar workers,” Cully said.
Judges hear challenge to Seaside Heights law aimed at after-prom parties

The initial complaint alleged that the state’s Wage and Hour Law, which was amended in 2019 to increase the minimum wage for most workers to $15, improperly forced farmworkers to wait longer than other workers to reach that amount. The law also exempts farmers from having to pay their workers overtime pay, which the lawsuit alleges is unconstitutional.
Under current law, New Jersey’s minimum wage for farmworkers is $14.20 an hour, and will rise to $15 beginning next year. The minimum wage for most workers rose to $15.92 on Jan. 1. The minimum wage for all workers will not be uniform until 2030.
When the Legislature amended the minimum wage law in 2019, it slowed proposed increases for farmworkers after hearing testimony from the New Jersey State Board of Agriculture president, who said farm employers would be hurt if the wage floor increased too quickly.
The plaintiffs argued that they represent a vulnerable group of workers who are often doing dangerous tasks, are paid substandard wages, largely don’t speak English, can’t access adequate health care, and cannot meaningfully advocate for their rights due to their immigration status.
State officials argued in court that the law doesn’t violate equal protection because being paid overtime or minimum wage is not a fundamental right. And they argued that farmworkers aren’t left out of minimum wage increases — they will receive them eventually, just at a slower rate.
Jeanne LoCicero, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, which joined with other groups in filing the lawsuit on behalf of CATA, said Wednesday’s ruling “brings us closer to achieving economic justice for farmworkers.”
“Farmworkers deserve a shot at making their case, and now they will get it,” LoCicero said in a statement.

Iowa Reps. Steven Holt, R-Denison; Mike Vondran, R-Davenport, and Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, held a news conference Wednesday about the three proposals that make up the House GOP crime package.
Holt, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, spoke on the House GOP “career criminals” bill that would establish a mandatory minimum 20-year sentence without parole for people convicted of repeated crimes. The mandatory minimum would trigger when a person has reached “three strikes,” or points, in a new system of evaluating crimes, Holt said.

The fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte, N.C, train in August showcases the need for this measure, Holt said. The man charged with stabbing her had a lengthy criminal history — “so long, in fact, that it left many of us scratching our heads wondering why this individual was ever let out of prison.”
“Had that individual been behind bars where he belonged, Iryna Zarutska would likely should be alive today,” Holt said. “None of us want this to happen in the state of Iowa, to someone in Iowa. This is why we have introduced this legislation.”
Under the proposed system, one point would be given for felony convictions as well as several specific aggravated misdemeanor charges, including sexual and domestic abuse, assault with the intent to inflict a serious injury or while using or displaying a dangerous weapon, organized retail theft and possession of a controlled substance. Half-points would be given for all other aggravated misdemeanors, as well as certain serious misdemeanors, such as assault causing bodily injury or mental illness, domestic abuse, harassment, unlawful possession of the controlled substance, theft in the fourth degree and criminal mischief the third degree.
When a person accumulates three “points” when charged with these offenses, Holt said that person would be required to serve a minimum of 20 years in prison, unless they are convicted of a crime with a higher minimum sentence. The measure would not apply retroactively.
While Holt brought up the death of Zarutska, he said there are several instances in Iowa of people convicted of serious crimes being released on parole and continuing to commit crimes.
“I believe that lives will be saved by this approach, of incarcerating individuals who refuse to be rehabilitated,” Holt said.
Many criminal justice and mental health advocates push back against measures seeking higher penalties for repeat offenses, saying that this will not help the issues that cause these individuals to repeatedly commit crimes, like substance use disorders and untreated mental health problems.
Holt said he believes Iowa, as a state, already commits “a massive amount of resources from the hard-working taxpayers of Iowa” to these issues. This measure, he said, allows the state to continue providing “help and rehabilitation,” while preventing people “that do not want to be rehabilitated” from posing a threat to public safety.
The second measure, led by Vondran, makes changes to Iowa’s bail system. In line with the “three strikes” legislation, he said, the proposal would state standard bond schedules could not be used for people arrested for crimes in certain “areas of concern,” such as intimidation with a dangerous weapon, possessing a firearm as a felon, or any forcible injuries.
The proposal would seek an update to statewide bail schedules adjusted for inflation, and require any judge who deviates from the established schedule to provide specific justification for why they are setting a different bail. The bill would also restrict “promise to appear” releases, when a person signs a document allowing them to be released from custody without being taken to jail. These releases would be prohibited when a person faces violent or drug-related simple or serious misdemeanor charges. Additionally, any pretrial release would require the Iowa Department of Corrections to present information to a magistrate that independently verifies the individual’s residency, employment and criminal record.
If approved, these measures could lead to more people being held in Iowa prisons and jails. According to state statistics, Iowa prisons are currently overcrowded, holding more than 20% above their facilities’ capacities.
When asked by a reporter about concerns about whether Iowa law enforcement believe local jails had the capacity to hold more individuals under the increased bail requirements, Vondran said the priority of House Republicans’ package was to keep Iowans “safe and secure in their homes and their communities.”
“Let me ask you a question in return: how long do we tolerate criminals on the street, chronic offenders, violent offenders, because we don’t have enough space?” Vondran said. “That’s an issue that will be addressed when we have that concern. I’ve not had anybody raise that question with me.”
These two measures are not yet available online, but House Republicans said they will be introduced before the end of the week. However, the third proposal, House Study Bill 631, led by Thomson, is already scheduled for a Feb. 5 subcommittee.
This bill proposes requiring the Iowa Judicial Branch to create a dashboard containing data on judges’ practices. The state would be required to collect and publish information on how often a judge departs from standard bail schedules or statutory sentencing recommendations, how quickly they rule on motions and cases, and how often their decisions are overturned by higher courts. Information in the database would be focused on criminal, not civil cases, Thomson said.
The database would also provide judges the ability to submit a 500-word statement on their judicial philosophy.
Thomson said this proposal would allow Iowans to better evaluate judges during judicial retention votes. While the Iowa State Bar Association releases a Judicial Performance Review ahead of Iowa elections where voters decide on whether Iowa judges stay in their positions, Thomson said this system would be “more robust” than the information provided by the ISBA, and would be more available to the public.

Organizers described the shutdown as a “nationwide day of no school, no work and no shopping” to protest the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s deployments and call on Congress to cut the federal funding that supports them. Already, hundreds of organizations have signed on in support of the protest, including several in Connecticut.
The strike is planned exactly one week after hundreds of Minnesota businesses, museums, schools, restaurants and other shops shuttered for the day on Jan. 23 as tens of thousands of residents marched in downtown Minneapolis in opposition to the increased presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the Twin Cities area. The protest followed the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by ICE agents in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.
On Saturday, the day after Minnesota’s general strike, Customs and Border Protection agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti, who worked as an intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital. Homeland Security agents have injured and killed several people during deployments in U.S. cities in recent months, including in Chicago and Los Angeles.
“The historic General Strike in Minneapolis showed them our power. This Friday we must answer the call from those on the frontline in Minneapolis and expand the strike,” a representative with Indivisible Southeast Connecticut, an organization taking part the strike, said in an emailed statement.
“The people of the Twin Cities have shown the way for the whole country — to stop ICE’s reign of terror, we need to SHUT IT DOWN,” the National Shutdown website reads.
Representatives for DHS didn’t respond to a request for comment on the planned strike. 
It’s unclear how many businesses in Connecticut are planning to close their doors this Friday in support of the shutdown. 
But several Connecticut-based organizations have signed on to “endorse” the strike, including New London Immigrant Defense, Workers’ Voice Connecticut, Hearing Youth Voices, Connecticut Democratic Socialists, CT Nurses United and ACT UP Connecticut according to a post on the Instagram page of New London Immigrant Defense.
Demonstrations are also planned in towns and cities across the state. 
In New Haven, an “Ice Out!” protest will take place at 1 p.m. on the New Haven Green. In Stamford, protestors will gather at 4 p.m. off Exit 14 on the Merritt Parkway, on the overpass between Darien and New Canaan. 
Members of AFT’s Connecticut chapter — a union that represents health care workers, educators and public service workers — will be in New London, where organizers with Indivisible Southeast Connecticut are holding a candlelight vigil and protest at the “whale tail” sculpture on State Street at 5 p.m.
Sherri Dayton, a nurse practitioner in Plantsville, said she plans to attend. Dayton said Pretti’s death hit home for her, and for many other nurses, because what Pretti did in his final moments went “to the core of what nurses do” — that is, they come to people’s aid. According to video footage of Pretti’s death, just before he was surrounded by CBP agents, he stepped between an agent and a female protestor the agent had shoved to the ground.
The demonstrations in Connecticut will continue on Saturday, with a vigil for Pretti “and all impacted by the violence of ICE” on the north steps of the state Capitol at noon, according to an Instagram post by Connecticut Nurses United.  The group will be joined by AFT Connecticut, Connecticut Working Families and several other organizations. 
John Brady, a registered nurse and the executive vice president of AFT Connecticut, said that Pretti’s death hit him hard. “The work of nurses doesn’t end when they leave” the workplace, Brady said.

(Photo by David Talukdar/Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered the Polk County Jail to immediately release an asylum seeker, ruling that the Russian immigrant was illegally detained through a “legal fiction” constructed by the federal government.
Since July 2025, immigration courts around the nation have been denying bond hearings for people detained in county jails by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The denials are based on the Trump administration’s newly adopted legal theory that longstanding federal laws require that ICE detainees who are at risk of being deported be held in jail without the possibility of bond.
As reported by Politico, more than 300 U.S. District Court judges in 1,600 cases have rejected that theory, finding the new interpretation of the law is contrary to ICE’s own regulations, its published enforcement guidelines, previous court rulings, and “the overall logic” of the nation’s immigration system.

Even so, Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice have continued to use that interpretation of the law to argue for mandatory detention in cases where immigrants have lived in the United States for months, years or decades.
Some of the immigration judges — who are not part of the Judicial Branch and instead function as administrative employees of the Executive Branch led by the president – continue to deny detainees bond hearings unless otherwise ordered by a federal judge in U.S. District Court.
One such case involves 26-year-old Arsen Kulumbekov, a Russian immigrant who came to the United States in March 2023 through the so-called “CBP One” process that at the time allowed migrants, at U.S. ports of entry, to request asylum or other legal pathways to residency.
Upon his entry to the United States, Kulumbekov was released, or paroled, with the understanding that he would have one year to formally apply for asylum. After filing for asylum in 2024, Kulumbekov was granted authorization to work in the United States and, by all accounts, he complied with the requirements of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to remain in the United States while his asylum case was pending.
Court records show that at some point, ICE issued an undated notice canceling Kulumbekov’s asylum application, and then forwarded his information to immigration court. In October 2025, ICE notified Kulumbekov that he was considered an alien who had been apprehended while in the process of entering the United States and that he was therefore subject to being detained without bond.
A few weeks later, in November 2025, ICE agents took Kulumbekov into custody and placed him in the Polk County Jail. Homeland Security then scheduled an immigration-court hearing for him in Texas, mistakenly believing he was being held in Polk County, Texas.
Kulumbekov then took Polk County, ICE and Homeland Security to U.S. District Court, where a judge ordered Homeland Security to show why Kulumbekov was not being unlawfully detained and then barred the agency from moving Kulumbekov outside Iowa’s Southern District without first giving the court notice and offering Kulumbekov a chance to be heard on the matter.
In response, the U.S. Department of Justice argued Kulumbekov was subject to mandatory detention without a bond hearing, citing the Trump administration’s new legal theory.
On Jan. 20, 2026, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger ruled against the government, citing the fact that ICE detained Kulumbekov 32 months after he entered the country, and not while he was in the process of entering. As such, Ebinger ruled, Kulumbekov was not subject to mandatory detention.
Citing previous case law on the subject, Ebinger characterized the Department of Justice’s position in the matter as a “legal fiction.” She also noted that upon entry to the United States, Kulumbekov had been paroled for one year, had successfully completed the term of his release, and had met the requirements of Homeland Security while his case for asylum proceeded.
“Kulumbekov is being unlawfully detained,” Ebinger ruled, ordering his immediate release from the Polk County Jail.
The judge then took the additional step of barring the U.S. Department of Justice from using the same “mandatory detention” theory to deny Kulumbekov bond in any subsequent proceedings they may bring against him.
Andrew Kahl of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District Iowa is the lead attorney for the government in the Kulumbekov case. He declined to comment on the judge’s ruling or the DOJ’s handling of the case.

The Chicago Bears might not be packing their bags yet — but Indiana’s bid for the team picked up momentum Wednesday after senators approved legislation creating a state-run stadium authority that could finance and build a National Football League stadium in northwest Indiana.
Senate Bill 27, authored by Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, advanced to the House in a 46-2 vote. Only Sens. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, and Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, voted against the bill.
The proposal establishes the Northwest Indiana Stadium Authority, a public body that would have the power to acquire land, issue long-term bonds and finance the construction of a professional football stadium and related facilities.

It’s the latest step in Indiana’s effort to court the Chicago Bears, who have publicly explored relocating amid stalled negotiations in Illinois over a proposed stadium development in Arlington Heights.
Mishler cautioned that the current draft “just creates the framework” and that “a lot of other details will need to be added” before the legislation could be finalized, including adding local representation to the authority’s board and outlining specific requirements and commitments from participating local governments. Discussions with local leaders are ongoing, he said.
Even so, Gov. Mike Braun praised the Senate’s action, calling it a key step in Indiana’s effort to attract the NFL franchise.
“Indiana is open for business and the Chicago Bears have taken notice,” Braun said in a statement. “The Senate’s passage of SB 27 to establish a Northwest Indiana stadium authority is the next critical step in the right direction to bring the Chicago Bears to the Hoosier state and to grow Indiana’s economy.”
How the deal would work
Senate Bill 27 outlines a stadium authority that would be responsible for acquiring land, constructing the stadium and issuing bonds — with bond maturities of up to 40 years — to finance the project.
The state would own the stadium, while an NFL franchise would lease the facility under a long-term agreement. The bill requires any NFL team leasing the stadium to commit to a lease of at least 35 years.
Bond payments would be made primarily from lease rental payments, which the legislation allows to be funded through local tax revenues, including proceeds from local excise taxes, food and beverage taxes and innkeeper’s taxes. The bill does not specify which local taxes would be used or how much revenue would be pledged, however.

The authority’s three-member board would initially consist of the director of the Indiana Office of Management and Budget or a designee; another OMB appointee, and the state’s public finance director.
Mishler said an additional local representation could be added later as negotiations progress.
The legislation also lays out a lease-back structure common in large public stadium deals. Those terms would allow the authority to finance and own the facility. The team, meanwhile, would operate it, keep revenue from games and non-football events, and be responsible for maintenance and improvements.
At the end of the lease term, the team would have the option to purchase the stadium — either for the cost of any remaining debt or, if the bonds are fully paid off, for $1, as long as conditions in the lease agreement are met.
Courting the Bears
Sen. Lonnie Randolph, D-East Chicago, framed the bill as a potential statewide economic opportunity.
“We don’t get an opportunity like this every day,” he said. “It is a bill that could be beneficial to not just the individual location … but to the entire state of Indiana, period.”
Randolph pointed to the economic and tourism impact of Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis and said a similar dynamic could take hold in northwest Indiana.
“That same kind of benefit could develop in northwest Indiana,” he said. “So we will have a dual effect, and that dual effect will be a dual positive impact.”

While he acknowledged uncertainty about whether a deal ultimately materializes, Randolph said early legislative support still matters.
“The more support that we show for this bill,” he said, “the better chance that reality could very well occur.”
Northwest Indiana leaders — including officials in Gary — have publicly pitched multiple lakefront and casino-adjacent sites as potential locations for a new stadium complex.
House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, said last week that House Republicans are prepared to take up the bill when it arrives.
“Yes,” Huston said when asked whether there is appetite in the House to create a stadium authority. “When that bill comes over, we’ll work closely with all the stakeholders and see what we can do on that.”
Huston rejected the idea that Indiana is merely being used as leverage in negotiations with Illinois.
“I trusted their word,” he said of conversations with the Bears. “I think we’re sincere in trying to figure out how to get this done.”
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, echoed that optimism, saying lawmakers from northwest Indiana are “excited” about what the project could bring.
“That’s part of bargaining, that’s part of making deals,” Bray said when asked about concerns Indiana could be used as a negotiating tool. “I trust that we will shine. The State of Indiana will shine, and we’ll put together a great package.”

,DC,2026-01-28 20:47:11+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Republicans celebrate school choice in US Senate hearing, while Dems question fairness",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republicans-celebrate-school-choice-us-senate-hearing-while-dems-question-fairness,,"WASHINGTON — The fierce debate surrounding school choice initiatives took center stage Wednesday during a hearing in a U.S. Senate panel. President Donald Trump’s administration and congressional Republicans have made school choice a central point of their education agenda, including a sweeping national school voucher program baked into the GOP’s mega tax and spending cut bill Trump signed into law in July. The hearing came in the middle of National School Choice Week, which the U.S. Department of Education dubbed a “time to highlight the many different types of education across the United States and to empower families to choose the best learning option for their child’s success.” The umbrella term “school choice” centers on alternative programs to one’s assigned public school. Opponents argue these efforts drain critical funds and resources from school districts, though advocates say the initiatives are necessary for parents dissatisfied with their local public schools.Sen. Bill Cassidy, chair of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which held the hearing, described school choice as “the avenue for expressing the innovation that we need to meet a student’s need.” “Traditional schools work for many students — what we’re asking, though, is to give the parent the choice if it does not,” the Louisiana Republican added.Many models for school choiceProponents in Ohio and Florida touted the work of their respective organizations and the broader school choice efforts in their states. Cris Gulacy-Worrel serves as vice president of Oakmont Education, an operator of dropout recovery charter schools serving more than 5,500 students in Ohio, Iowa and Michigan. Gulacy-Worrel said last year, Oakmont Education “graduated 1,309 students, and we’ve placed over 4,500 young people directly into the workforce over the last three years alone.”“For far too long, we’ve been told school choice is about (Education Savings Accounts) or public charter schools — it’s not,” she said. “What we’re really talking about is educational plurality, a system with room for many models and many pathways to success.”John Kirtley is chairman of Step Up For Students, a nonprofit scholarship funding organization that distributes scholarships for children in Florida. Kirtley said his state “has been moving towards a new definition of public education: Raise taxpayer dollars to educate children, but then empower families to direct those dollars to different providers and even different delivery methods that best suit their individual children’s learning needs.” More than half of all K-12 students in the Sunshine State participate in a school choice program rather than attending their local public school. Bernie Sanders sees two-tier system createdMeanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, the panel’s ranking member, said that while there are a “number of things we can and should be doing to strengthen and improve education” in the country, “we should not be creating a two-tier education system in America — private schools for the wealthy and well-connected and severely under-funded and under-resourced public schools for low-income, disabled and working-class kids.” The Vermont independent said that “unfortunately, that is precisely what the Trump administration and my Republican colleagues in Congress are doing,” pointing to the national school voucher program that’s now law. Sanders’ staff released a committee report Wednesday analyzing the state laws of 21 states with school voucher programs that scholarship granting organizations administer, in an effort to understand the forthcoming federal school voucher program’s potential effects.Among the findings, the report concluded that “nearly half of analyzed private schools (48%) explicitly state that they choose not to provide some or all students with disabilities with the services, protections, and rights provided to those students in public schools under federal law.” Arizona voucher programMarisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, testified about the negative repercussions of private school vouchers in the Grand Canyon state. In 2022, Arizona became the first state in the country to enact a universal school voucher program. Garcia described her state’s voucher program as a “bloated mess costing three times more than it was projected” and said vouchers “often only offer the illusion of choice.” “Every child deserves a great public school in Arizona,” she added. “Our experiences show that vouchers are not the way to achieve that goal.” National school voucher program The permanent national school voucher program, starting in 2027, allocates up to $1,700 in federal tax credits for individuals who donate to organizations that provide private and religious school scholarships. The program reflects a sweeping bill that Cassidy and GOP Reps. Adrian Smith of Nebraska and Burgess Owens of Utah had reintroduced in their respective chambers in 2025.Cassidy defended the program during the hearing, saying: “We’re not trying to supplant funding for public education — we’re trying to supplement funding for education.” As of Tuesday, nearly half of all states have opted in to the initiative, per the Education Department.",,,,2026-01-28 16:01:04.432551

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Services ranging from counseling for children suffering from sexual violence to post-assault examinations could end if New Mexico lawmakers don’t step in, providers told Source NM.
A coalition representing 14 organizations that support sexual assault survivors and work to prevent sexual violence across New Mexico urged state lawmakers Tuesday to make a $2 million permanent, recurring investment in their programs.
Lawmakers for the past three years have approved one-time grant funds for sexual assault programs, following 2022 federal changes to the Victims of Crime Act funding, which resulted in 40% cuts for programs across the country, including New Mexico.
The Farmington-based Sexual Assault Services of Northwestern used the one-time funding to pay for a certified nurse to offer exams for sexual-assault victims in Gallup.
But without sustained funding, Executive Director Eleana Butler said, the ability to continue giving exams is in jeopardy.
“This isn’t even about expanding, it’s about continuing the services already in place,” Butler said.
The one-time funds also helped expand some organizations’ footprint into more rural areas, said Krysta Montez, the director of prevention programs at La Piñon Sexual Assault Recovery Services in Las Cruces.
“In years past, people would have to travel more than four hours, from Animas or further out, to reach us, but with satellite offices in Deming and T or C, we can offer our support,” Montez said.
Beyond sustained funding, survivors and advocates for the program said they also are pushing lawmakers to support House Bill 151. Sponsored by Albuquerque Democrats Senate Pro Tem Mimi Stewart and Rep. Marianna Anaya, HB151 would extend the civil statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse, allowing a victim to bring a lawsuit until their 58th birthday, rather than age 24, the current legal limit.
Finally, the advocates want New Mexico lawmakers to pass petitions for future studies. Those include: closing the backlog on sexual assault evidence kits; strengthening state protections against rape in jails and prisons; and House Memorial 10, which would conduct a study on sexual health education across the state as a prevention tool.
Prosecutors warn New Mexico lawmakers about ‘new backlog’ in rape kits

However, within the limits of a 30-day session, advocates said their best hope is securing permanent support in the state’s budget. Recent Trump administration moves to cut crime victims’ funding constitute an existential threat, said Sachi Watase, the executive director of the NM Asian Family Center.
“If our services can’t continue because of ongoing threats to our funding, to our existence of a culturally-specific service, we’d be failing so many New Mexicans,” Watase told Source NM. “It’s really important for our state lawmakers to fill the gap and step up.”

Larry Stutts, R-Tuscumbia, walks on the floor of the Alabama Senate on Jan. 14, 2026 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate Committee passed a bill Wednesday that would exempt “covered” K-12 schools and higher education institutions construction projects costing less than $750,000 from all state inspections.
SB 88, sponsored by Sen. Larry Stutts, R-Tuscumbia, passed the committee 11-2. It would prevent the Division of Construction Management (DCM), located in the Department of Finance, from conducting inspections on school projects costing less than $750,000 for Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and fire and safety compliance. 
“I was approached by several people in the education community in my area about the cost of construction and delays in construction when the Department of Construction Management gets involved in a project,” Stutts said to the Senate Finance and Taxation Education Committee.
Currently, DCM does not inspect projects under $750,000, save for those compliance issues. 
Sens. Roger Smitherman, D-Birmingham and Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery voted against the bill, while Sen. David Sessions, R-Grand Bay, abstained.
Stutts claimed there are unnecessary inspections happening on smaller projects.
“We have qualified architects, we have qualified contractors. And when they get involved and are building relatively small projects, we don’t need somebody else to come inspect behind them and be in the middle of the process,” Stutts said.
Ryan Hollingsworth, executive director of School Superintendents of Alabama, spoke in favor of the bill. He said the Legislature in 2021 exempted most K-12 construction projects under $500,000 from DCM inspection, raising the threshold to $750,000 in 2022.
“This bill would take it back to the 2021 version and raise the $500,000 up to $750,000 with no required requirement to submit,” he said. “So we operated on that 2021 version for about a year, maybe a little longer. I’m not aware of issues that came up during that time. I never heard of those.”
Alec Whaley, a general contractor based in Troy, opposed the bill, saying there are certain counties that have no one other than the DCM to do safety inspections.
“I would hate for there to be an unintended consequence. It would be an effort to try to save some money in missing something and not having that peer review, and some children get hurt,” Whaley said.
Scott Williams, an architect speaking on behalf of the American Institute of Architects, said the bill isn’t necessary.
“We have a great process. We don’t feel that it’s horribly expensive. It’s not time consuming. If I organize my projects, I’ve got the building commissions reviews, I’ve got the building commissions inspections, all of it timed out pretty good,” he said.
When asked by Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, what kind of projects $750,000 can cover, Williams said it’s mostly renovations and echoed Whaley’s concerns about safety.
“The process of doing some work on an existing building opens up situations that you were not aware of when your program was initially started,” he said.
Smitherman also had safety concerns.
“If because the paramount decision and those pride decisions did not make the top priority, the safety and well being of the young people who are going to be affected by the projects, if they are not up to standard is simply this, we can’t bring them back if they’re dead,” Smitherman said.
Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, said she voted for the bill because she understands the pressure K-12 schools are under for funding.
“When we can give charter schools and tax credits to people who already had decided to send their children to private schools, you’re trying to find ways to make up for the money you’re not getting because we’re not adequately funding you, which is our first priority,” Figures said. “So of course, I’m always about safety, but I also know that there will be inspectors. And as the contractor said, so many of these projects are small projects,” she said.
If passed, the legislation would go into effect Oct. 1. It goes to the Senate.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Larry-Stutts-Jan-14-2026-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 16:01:04.432551

Gabe Amo and nearly three dozen other Congressional Democrats are asking federal law enforcement agencies for a formal briefing on their investigations of the mass shooting at Brown University last month that killed two students and wounded nine.  
Amo, whose First Congressional District includes the Ivy League school’s Providence campus, is lead signatory on the Jan. 28 letter addressed to FBI Director Kash Patel and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Acting Director Daniel P. Driscoll. The Democratic representative is one of 33 signatures attached to the letter, a list which also includes Rhode Island’s other Democratic congressional delegate Seth Magaziner.
Amo and the reps credit the local, state and federal law enforcement, including the Boston divisions of the FBI and ATF, with identifying the “individual responsible for this heinous crime.” The Dec. 13, 2025, shooting occurred at the Barus & Holley engineering building on the Brown campus.
“We seek to learn more about developments in the case, including how the individual responsible for this crime obtained a firearm and other details relevant to our oversight responsibilities,” Amo and his colleagues wrote.
In a press release on the letter, Amo’s office characterized the request as being aimed at “transparency” about the investigation and noted Amo’s role on the Congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. 
Other letter signers include Massachusetts Reps. Jake Auchincloss and Ayanna Pressley.
Brown University is conducting its own investigations into the shooting response and the aftermath.

Marvin Knuckles, 48, was eligible for parole in 2028, according to his online inmate profile.
Knuckles, who was incarcerated at the Eastern Kentucky Correctional Complex on drug charges, was part of a “work crew of inmates” that was “removing snow and ice debris on facility grounds prior to the start of regular inmate movement” early on Tuesday morning, according to the Justice and Safety Cabinet. 
During that work, the cabinet said, he fell and injured his head. He died at Appalachian Regional Hospital in West Liberty around 7:30 a.m. 
Cabinet spokeswoman Morgan Hall said Tuesday night Knuckles was assigned to an outside detail unit “for good behavior.” 
“Inmates assigned to this unit outside the prison fence are provided opportunities to work several jobs,” she said. Knuckles worked on the tree farm, road crew and special details.  
“When asked who was able to help with the special assignment of ice removal, Knuckles volunteered to assist,” Hall said. 
A winter storm hit Kentucky over the weekend, with some areas getting 13 inches of snow. In Eastern Kentucky, the National Weather Services reports about 3-4 inches of snow. 
Justice and Public Safety Cabinet Secretary Keith Jackson said in a statement that “we will conduct a thorough review of this situation to better prevent this from happening again.”
“This tragic accident is one that we work to avoid each day as we protect those in our custody,” Jackson said. “We extend our deepest condolences to the family of Mr. Knuckles and to our correctional staff.”

The state’s first poet laureate was appointed in 1919, and there have been 10 others since then. The two-year role is meant to honor writers and promote poetry and literacy in the state, and laureates often do readings at schools, libraries and literary festivals.
Polis said there is an emphasis on honoring Colorado’s 150th anniversary of statehood this year.
“Especially as we celebrate our state’s 150th and our nation’s 250th birthday, this milestone is an opportunity to honor and learn from our past and then really look forward to a bright future that celebrates the arts and their critical role here in Colorado,” he said.

“Apache’s critical work and inspiring voice will invite all Coloradans to reflect upon our storied histories, contextualize the realities of today and boldly imagine a future where all Coloradans can belong and thrive,” Colorado Creative Industries Director Josh Blanchard said in a statement.
CCI, Colorado Humanities, and Colorado Center for the Book support the poet laureate position. CCI is a division of the state’s Office of Economic Development and International Trade.
Gibson served as the poet laureate from September 2023 until their death from ovarian cancer in July 2025. They are the subject of the Oscar-nominated documentary “Come See Me in the Good Light.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)An Iowa House subcommittee moved ahead a bill Wednesday to change how state universities determine admission through different test scores.
House Study Bill 547 would require the Iowa Board of Regents to develop a policy for students applying to state universities who do not qualify for admission based on the regent admission index, which combines ACT or SAT test scores, high school grade-point average and number of completed core classes.
For these students, the bill would require universities to only use “merit and likelihood of employment in Iowa after graduation” in deciding whether to admit them or not. The board of regents would also have to incorporate the Classic Learning Test into the regent admission index if the legislation is passed.

A report released by the board in April 2024 recommended leaving the Classic Learning Test out of the admission index until its viability can be better measured, and only use it in individual students’ cases. According to its website, more than 300 colleges and universities accept the test.
Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jillian Carlson said the board is registered as undecided on the bill, and referenced the report. She said state universities do accept the test for admission, it just hasn’t been incorporated into the regents admission index.
Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Birmingham, chaired the subcommittee and was joined by Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville. Rep. John Wills, R-Spirit Lake, was on the subcommittee but did not attend the meeting. The subcommittee approved the bill to head to the full Iowa House Higher Education Committee, Shipley said in a text message.
Jacoby was opposed to the legislation, saying in an interview after the meeting the board needs to have admissions measures that have been tested, and the Classic Learning Test is “such a low denominator for potential students” that he’s not sure it’s accurate.
Another concern he had was of students signaling their intent to stay in Iowa after graduation and then leaving after graduation anyway. There are no pre- and post-tests to measure this, he said, and the board of regents doesn’t have staff to handle it.
He is, however, in favor of taking a more holistic view in admissions than just looking at ACT and SAT scores and allowing students to create portfolios that they could submit to universities for admission.

Last week, a federal judge in the Middle District of Georgia dismissed a similar lawsuit, arguing that the Macon-based court lacked jurisdiction over the case “because the Attorney General’s demand was not made, and the demanded records are not located, in the Middle District of Georgia.”
Federal judge tosses out DOJ lawsuit seeking sensitive voter data in Georgia

Georgia is now one of at least three states in which federal judges have dismissed lawsuits seeking sensitive voter information. The judge assigned to the new lawsuit filed in Atlanta, Eleanor L. Ross, was appointed by President Barack Obama.
In both lawsuits, the Department of Justice argued that Georgia’s unredacted voter registration list was needed as part of an ongoing investigation into “Georgia’s compliance with federal election law.”
Raffensperger had previously sent redacted voter registration data to Justice Department officials, but he argued that state law prohibited his office from divulging the Social Security numbers, full dates of birth and driver’s license numbers of Georgia residents. He maintained that stance in the face of a pressure campaign from some state lawmakers and members of Georgia’s State Election Board urging him to turn over the data.
In an op-ed published earlier this month by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Raffensperger defended his decision not to release the unredacted data. He also criticised the lawmakers who cosponsored a Senate resolution urging him to comply with the Justice Department’s request for the data, saying they were “putting political ambition ahead of common sense and public service.”
Raffensperger rebuffs pressure campaign to hand over sensitive voter data to feds

The resolution, which passed the Senate Ethics Committee last week, will be up for a vote Thursday in the Senate.
Georgia is among at least 44 states who have received requests from the Justice Department for their complete voter data, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, which is tracking the requests. It is also among the 24 states that the Brennan Center says are currently facing lawsuits for refusing to turn over all the requested data, which includes voters’ names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. 
In September, the Trump administration disclosed that the Department of Justice is also sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens.

The Legislature created the council last spring to oversee close to $300 million of money Mississippi won from drug companies that contributed to the opioid epidemic. Over the next eight months, the council was appointed, created an application for grants that would address addiction, reviewed submissions and recommended which proposals the Legislature should fund. 
Many of the council’s 37 members hold high-ranking positions with organizations that applied for opioid settlement money. After the small groups of council members reviewed the 127 applications for the first time, Mississippi Today found that over $94 million of the roughly $142 million requested from the highest ranked applications came from organizations with a representative on the council. 
The committee adjusted those recommendations after the initial meeting, but some council members openly lobbied for applications they were associated with at later meetings. Some of those efforts helped the council members’ applications move up in the rankings. 
The newly proposed legislation would prohibit council members from indirectly or directly influencing financial decisions — including the discussion and ranking of proposals — for applications they’re associated with. It goes beyond the current council conflict of interest rules, which simply instructs members to not vote on those grants.

Sen. Mike Seymour, the Republican Ethics Committee chair from Vancleave and lead author of the bill, said reports of the council’s conflicts of interest last fall brought this issue to his attention. 
“If we’re all there, and we’re all going to ask for grant money and we’re all appointees, it gives a bad light,” he said.
Attorney General Lynn Fitch, the council’s chair, did not respond to an email asking about her thoughts on the bill. When Mississippi Today asked her about council conflicts of interest last fall, her office cited the existing ethics rules in place and said it would disadvantage the state to prohibit council members from applying for opioid settlement money.
James Moore, a Hattiesburg recovery advocate and opioid settlement council member, leads an organization that applied for funds last year. He chose not to lobby for his application, and it wasn’t highly recommended by the council to be funded. 
Moore said he wants some clarification about how the bill would change interactions between the council and grant applicants. But overall, he supports the bill. 
“I don’t know how anyone could oppose that,” he said. 
Greg Spore, another council member and lawyer for the Office of State Public Defender, said he wishes a provision like this was in place during the 2025 opioid settlement grant evaluation period. He said it’s discouraging that it takes a legislative bill to prevent potential conflicts of interest. 
“The council should not have to be reminded to do the right thing,” he said in a text message to Mississippi Today.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Less than a week before Gov. Josh Shapiro is expected to unveil his spending proposal to kickstart the next state budget process, a group of county commissioners detailed their funding requests to support all 67 counties. 
Key issues introduced on Wednesday include increasing the monthly 911 surcharge paid by phone users, boosting funding for mental health services and assistance for home reassessments. 
“These priorities reflect our enduring commitment to providing exceptional services while using tax dollars in a responsible manner,” said Kyle Kopko, the executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania.  
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Atop the list is adding funding for 911 services. A 2023 law raised the fee from $1.65 to $1.95, netting $322 million in its first year. According to a 2025 breakdown of funds, 98% of the funding, or roughly $316 million, goes to 61 Public Safety Answering Points and the remainder pays for system upgrades and program administration. 
The association is pushing for another increase of “no less than” $2.20, but CCAP President Joe Kantz, a Snyder County commissioner, said that “even at that level, the surcharge will still fall below inflation.” 
“This is a service counties are proud to provide, but as technology evolves and costs rise, counties need a consistent and sustainable funding structure to continue fulfilling the responsibility,” said Kantz. “Counties have been forced to rely increasingly on local property tax dollars just to keep pace with rising costs.”
Collectively, more than 13.9 million emergency calls were made in 2024, more than one call per Pennsylvanian. Kantz said that the first surcharge of $1 in 1990 for some counties would be equivalent to $2.48 today.
 Reassessing property values

Counties are tasked with calculating property values and regularly reassessing to ensure they “accurately reflect current market conditions,” said Jeff Thomas, a Huntingdon County commissioner. 
The numbers play a key role in calculating property taxes, which fund schools, law enforcement and other local public services. State law dictates the framework, Thomas said, but “the administration of, funding and timing of reassessments fall squarely” on counties. 
According to a map shared by CCAP, 27 counties haven’t completed a full reassessment since before 1999, compared to 14 which have gone through the process since 2020. Beaver County’s 2024 review had a price tag of nearly $8 million. 
(From the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania)
Market conditions and staffing capacity determine when a county can conduct a reassessment, which Thomas said was revenue neutral and didn’t increase taxes. Rather, they ensured fairness.
“While essential for fairness and equity, reassessments are costly, technical and resource intensive, especially for counties that have not done one in many years,” said Thomas. 
Assistance to counties could include designating a state agency to oversee assessments, potential grant funding and develop standards. Additionally, commissioners pushed for a legislative study to examine the state’s system and identify opportunities for reform. 
“Property reassessment is always a hot button issue,” said Thomas. “But with the right policy changes, we can make the process more efficient, timely and accurate to the benefit of all Pennsylvanians.” 
 Mental health

According to CCAP, counties received nearly $671 million in the 2024-2025 budget, slightly higher than recent years but tens of millions less than pre-2021 budgets. 
Greene County Commissioner Betsy McClure said that county-level services include community residential programming, family-based support, outpatient care and crisis intervention. 
“Counties have stretched limited state funding to serve as many residents as possible, but we are now at a breaking point,” McClure said. “Inadequate state funding paired with increasing demand has pushed the county mental health system to the point of collapse.”

She added that more dollars would reduce reported delays of at least six months for services, though people  often wait much longer. Money could also help stabilize existing services and address workforce shortages.
“In our area, we don’t have providers. We don’t have psychiatrists or psychologists. There’s a deficit,” said McClure. “From doctors all the way down to counselors … trying to find providers to fit into all those slots is very hard.” 
Fortunately, McClure said, there are two health systems within a 30-mile radius to serve her rural population’s needs, plus another across the state border in West Virginia. 
But it’s the only county in the southwest region that doesn’t have a transit system. The population of just under 36,000 can use shared ride services, where a 15-mile trip can cost nearly $20, said McClure. 
“That’s unaffordable,” said McClure.
McClure told the Capital-Star she used to work as a school nurse, saying Pennsylvanians had come a long way in reducing any stigma around mental health, but services haven’t kept up — particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“We’re getting past the stigma of parents not wanting to seek help for their children, but then providing it timely … it’s like, ‘Today I’m ready, but I can’t get an appointment for a month or two or maybe three.” 
That delayed care can exacerbate what initially was a relatively minor issue, she said. 
“The unmet community need has created a growing population of individuals that become involved with emergency departments, law enforcement and the criminal justice system when no appropriate diversion exists,” said McClure. “The remaining solutions are hospitals or incarceration, both of which are not appropriate settings for mental health treatment and (are) more costly.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8327-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-28 15:01:58.615647

Connecticut patients registered under the state’s medical marijuana program receive tax-free cannabis products. But items purchased under the recreational, or Adult-Use Cannabis Program, are subject to several taxes in Connecticut.
To obtain tax-free cannabis, patients’ health care providers must certify that they have an approved condition on the state’s eligible list and patients then register with the Department of Consumer Protection.
The Adult-Use Cannabis market, on the other hand, serves all adults 21 years or older and registration is not required. Cannabis purchased, however, is subject to a 6.35% sales tax, 3% tax to municipalities and a cannabis tax based on milligrams of THC.
Medical cannabis can be more potent in Connecticut, but because the market is so small, it’s not seen as a profitable business for manufacturers and retailers, contributing to a drop in the state’s sales, according to a report by CT Insider.

“Dr. Ellington is a long-respected member of this body, and his dedication to bettering the education West Virginia children receive is to be commended,” House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, said in a news release. “Many of us have leaned on him for his counsel, but now in this new role we will be relying on him for even more input and counsel in a wider area of policy.”
Ellington, an OB-GYN, has served as chair of the House Education Committee since 2019, He announced that he’d be stepping down from that role at the end of an Education Committee meeting on Tuesday.
Hanshaw, while addressing committee members, explained that former Deputy Speaker David Kelly had done a lot of administrative work for the House, including driving budget conversations in the executive branch and Senate. Kelly resigned from the House last year to serve as the state’s commissioner of corrections. Hanshaw said Kelly’s absence was “noteworthy.”
“To take care of that and to help us drive the overall agenda of the House, I’ve asked Del. Ellington if he’d be willing to assume the role of deputy speaker of the House,” Hanshaw said. 
Ellington said that he was “honored to serve in that lineup.”
Del. Joe Statler, R-Monongalia, will now serve as chairman of the House Education Committee and plans to focus on public school funding.
Statler has served as vice chair of the Education Committee. He served on the Monongalia County Board of Education from 2002 to 2012.
Del. Chris Toney, R-Raleigh, will serve as Education Committee vice chairman.
“Our education team didn’t use the previous session adjournment as a reason to stop working on solutions to the major issues we know our communities across the state are facing, so we didn’t want to disrupt that work going into this session, but it became clear right away that our committee will keep working hard on their efforts to improve education,” Ellington said.

Applications for replacement SNAP benefits must be submitted by mail, email or online to the Department of Human Services within 10 days of the outage. The application deadline is Feb. 3. 
Replacement SNAP benefits are available to beneficiaries year-round if food is destroyed because of a disaster, including flood, fire and severe weather. Recipients are asked to report the value of the food lost. If approved, replacement benefits equal to the value of the food lost will be issued, up to the maximum amount of SNAP benefits issued for the month, according to the MDHS website. 
As of midday Wednesday, about 8% homes and businesses in Mississippi remained without power, according to poweroutage.us
MDHS spokesman Mark Jones said the department is working to share information about replacement benefits through the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency and local emergency management authorities. The team is also working on a flyer for Red Cross and Salvation Army shelter locations.
“We find every avenue we can,” Jones said. 
Most SNAP recipients are expected to work or volunteer to qualify for assistance. The work requirements remain the same during the storm, Jones said.

Unsurprisingly, rates of turnover have increased since the pandemic. The authors of the report plan to conduct a survey to determine why teachers leave. I’ll save them some time. If you were treated in your job the way teachers are in theirs, you’d leave too.
As in any job, teachers want to be successful. They want their students to learn and grow as human beings. Yet the conditions in our schools make that impossible. Every year, class sizes grow. Every year new requirements are added and resources are taken away. If you were in a job that became more difficult every year with less and less chance of success, would you stay?
Teachers must hold degrees in education. Teachers must pass national exams. They are vetted by the state for certification. Yet teachers aren’t respected as professionals. The current push for school choice and parental rights combined with the proliferation of low accountability education options like correspondence schools send a clear message to career educators: Anyone can do your job. Your expertise and professional opinions don’t matter. Our governor has made this message part of his educational policies by continuously attacking teachers’ organizations and unions in a way he has not attempted with other professions like electricians or equipment operators. Yet when educators express funding concerns, the governor portrays them as special interests and implies they are an obstacle to student success rather than the instrument of success. If you were in a career where you were attacked and belittled every year by parents, lawmakers and our governor why would you stay?
Finally, teachers aren’t compensated adequately. Alaska used to pay teachers 170% of the national average and offer an excellent defined benefit retirement package. Today that number is 110%, which barely adjusts for the cost of living in our state — facts our governor tried to suppress. Without a defined benefit package, today’s retirement packages offer no incentive to stay in Alaska or in education.
I spent more than twenty years in Alaska schools as both a teacher and principal. There is only one thing I would do differently. I would never encourage students to pursue education as a career. Working with kids is incredibly rewarding, but the conditions educators face are unbearable. No one should spend their career being underpaid, underappreciated and under constant pressure to do the impossible. Nothing about this is confusing — except why lawmakers haven’t been able to fix it.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A bipartisan bill to reduce school lunch debt is back, and it’s headed to the House floor after unanimous approval in the House Revenue and Taxation Committee. 
Sponsored by Rep. Matt MacPherson, R-West Valley City, HB148 would allow Utahns to make a donation towards a school lunch debt relief program through their state tax forms, similar to other voluntary donation programs. The non-tax deductible donation would have no effect on state tax revenue.
“This was a pretty simple bill that we passed last year, it went unanimous in both the House and the Senate,” MacPherson told Utah News Dispatch. “Last year we ran it in the last two weeks of session, and we just ran out of time.”
Starting July 1, Utah students qualifying for reduced-priced lunches can get meals for free

School meals debts are “outstanding unpaid balances for school meals provided to students,” according to the bill. In 2025, Utah expanded its free lunch program for qualifying students. 
MacPherson, who expects the bill “will pass through flying,” has garnered bipartisan support. HB148 is co-sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City. 
“This is a really simple way that we could perhaps provide an avenue for taxpayers in the state to try to help tackle a problem, and it would allow pretty much anyone to make a dent into this, in any amount, small or large,” he said to the committee. “(It uses) a mechanism that’s already established and has operated successfully in a lot of other ways.”
MacPherson emphasized school lunch debt throughout Utah “is in the millions,” and the bill is “not intended to solve the problem, but perhaps make a dent in it.”
The bill requires the State Board of Education to gather data on school lunch debt statewide, as well as granting them full authority over the program. 
“The State Board of Education would identify the total meals debt that’s outstanding by school district, and then would receive the funds that come from this account and appropriate it out appropriately to districts based on need,” MacPherson said. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While speaking with the Dispatch, he emphasized that the bill puts power in the hands of Utah’s Board of Education, saying “we’re leaving that all up to them, that’s my preference.”
“All is going to depend on how much money is there. If it’s a very small pot, they may have to be creative, because only giving a few dollars to each school may not be very effective,” he said. “They may want to tackle larger debts first. If it’s a larger pot of money, then maybe they’ll distribute it a little more evenly, but I want to leave it to them.”
It also includes a provision that would automatically cancel the program if it generates “less than $30,000 per year for three consecutive years,” according to the bill. 
“It’s pretty simple, and it does have a very minor fiscal impact as far as setting up the fund,” he said. “It’s expected to generate $30,000 but again, if it doesn’t, then whatever costs associated (with) this will not be ongoing.”

(Via Liv Caputo/Florida Phoenix)U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, the far and away frontrunner in the Florida gubernatorial race, wasted little time Wednesday on his Republican competitors and lead critics, brushing them off as jealous of his success.
“My rivals would all love to be in my position, and they’re not,” he said during a media briefing at the Florida Capitol when asked about claims that he’s a “DEI hire” with a “thin record” in Congress.
“Next question.”
Trump-endorsed Donalds has amassed a $45 million war chest seven months ahead of the Republican primary. That’s $40 million more than the next highest earner in the race, former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner — who’s begun to attack Donalds on social media for “lying.”
Buttressed by sweeping endorsements at all levels and heavy-hitting financial backers, Donalds has started to shift from smaller-scale intra-party sniping to broader political issues. These include both the behind-the-scenes influence of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ operatives and the reckoning on immigration tactics now facing the Trump administration.
Investor James Fishback, a new entrant to the gubernatorial race, has led the charge on lobbing brazen insults at Donalds. He’s partially built his campaign off of personal social media attacks on Donalds, claiming the Black representative is a “slave” to donors and a “DEI hire.”
Fishback, for his part, hasn’t been operating alone.
Christina Pushaw, a top DeSantis staffer, was quietly advising the investor for months — without the governor’s knowledge, she insists. DeSantis has long opposed Donalds succeeding him as governor, telling voters last year that Donalds isn’t active enough as a member of a Congress and missed out on Florida’s conservative wins.
Pushaw and Fishback publicly split after she claimed Fishback was falsely telling people they were dating. Other news organizations have reported that at least one other member of the governor’s office has been quietly advising Fishback.
“I’ll leave that to the governor and his team,” Donalds said of Pushaw Wednesday. “Campaigns all take on a life of their own. … I stay focused on what I’m doing.”
He said that he’ll consider debating fellow candidates after qualifying in June.
“You qualify, then we’ll talk,” he said. “Qualifying for the ballot matters, because that means you’re an actual candidate for governor.”
On Minneapolis: ‘I’m not gonna go that far’
Although Donalds showed little patience for his underfunded challengers, he was more cautious when pressed on a volatile issue roiling the GOP: use of lethal force by immigration agents during protests in Minneapolis.
This month alone, ICE and border patrol have been responsible for two videoed killings of protesters, one of which the administration agreed was justified while the other, the death of Alex Pretti over the weekend, has split the party. The Department of Homeland Security initially claimed Pretti planned to “massacre” law enforcement.
Those misleading comments quickly sparked an ever-evolving blame game within the Trump administration and top immigration officials, Axios reported. Since then, some Republicans have called for an investigation into Pretti’s death while others maintain his death was justified.
Donalds struck a more measured tone.
“I’m not gonna go that far [to say it’s justified]. The investigation will bear that out, but I think it’s important as we level set: a loss of American life is a tragedy. No one wants to see that,” Donalds said. “Mr. Pretti or any other American, you have a right to protest. We will always protect that right. I will protect that right.”
He continued, standing by Americans’ right to bear arms under the Second Amendment while doubling down on his support for immigration authorities and insistence that Minnesota’s leaders comply with federal immigration orders.
“But when you decide, whether it’s Renee Good, to use your vehicle to disrupt law enforcement, which is what she was doing that entire day, and then you’re driving at law enforcement; or in the situation of Mr. Pretti, you were on the sidewalks recording law enforcement and then you decide to impede law enforcement, the entire dynamics change,” he said.
“It’s not as cut and dry. The investigation will bear all this out, and then we’ll go from there.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_1169-1024x970.jpeg,,,2026-01-28 15:01:58.615647

Lenney called the voter affidavit a “loophole.” 
“I would submit that there’s no valid excuse to show up last minute at the polls without an ID,” Lenney said.
He noted the Legislature in 2023 approved a bill that eliminated the use of student IDs as valid photo identification for voting or for registration, but created a no-fee ID issued by the Department of Transportation that may be used for voting. 
“You can’t go to a bar without an ID and sign a piece of paper saying, ‘I swear I’m 21,’ and get and get served drinks,” Lenney said.
Lenney introduced a similar bill last year, but it never received a hearing. In 2023, Rep. Joe Alfieri, R-Coeur d’Alene, proposed a bill to eliminate the voter affidavit, but it died in a 33-36 vote in the Idaho House of Representatives, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma City Democrat on Wednesday resigned effective immediately after pleading guilty to forgery-related charges. 
Rep. Ajay Pittman, D-Oklahoma City, received a seven year deferred sentence and must pay restitution to a charitable organization in addition to the terms of a separate settlement agreement with the Ethics Commission. The separate settlement agreement Pittman entered into Tuesday requires she resign from office and bars her from holding public office for 15 years. 
Pittman pleaded guilty Wednesday to multiple charges including conspiracy to commit a felony, forgery in the second degree, and violating the Oklahoma Computer Crimes Act, according to a news release from the Attorney General’s Office.
Pittman was first charged Wednesday with the crimes and appeared before an Oklahoma County District Court judge the same day to plead guilty. 
She did not immediately return a request for comment, but in her resignation letter wrote that she chose to “step aside” after “careful consideration” because it is in the best interest of her district and “our great institution.”
“This decision will allow the House’s work to continue without distractions and ensure that the focus remains on the needs of Oklahoma’s people,” she wrote.
The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office, which investigated Pittman, said she faced felony charges related to submitting a forged check to the Oklahoma Ethics Commission in an effort to avoid repaying funds to her campaign account. 
“The scheme involved altering and creating a false $2,500 check and using a computer network to transmit the fraudulent document to state officials while representing it as genuine,” according to a statement from the Attorney General’s Office. 
Pittman initially settled with the Ethics Commission in 2024 and was ordered to pay $35,000 for improperly using campaign funds for personal use. She failed to comply with the settlement agreement, leading to further investigation by the Ethics Commission, which eventually filed a separate civil lawsuit to recover damages. 
The lawsuit alleged that Pittman had filed false documents in an effort to comply with her original settlement. Her Tuesday settlement agreement concludes this pending lawsuit, according to a news release from the Ethics Commission.

The Ethics Commission called their cases against Pittman the “most serious campaign finance enforcement matters in recent years.” 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, said they coordinated closely with the Attorney General’s Office to “ensure full accountability under both civil and criminal law.”
“This case involved intentional misconduct and deception, not reporting errors or technical mistakes,” Bruce Boone said. “Campaign funds are not personal funds, and when an elected official deliberately abuses that trust, the Commission will pursue every appropriate remedy available under the law.” 
The Ethics Commission settlement requires Pittman to repay the remaining civil penalty of more than $17,000 from the 2024 settlement and provide proof of compliance. It also bars her from running for public office in Oklahoma for the next 15 years, according to a copy of the settlement signed Tuesday.  
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said her caucus remains committed to accountability and transparency. 
“While we believe everyone has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law, with charges formally filed, we know that Rep. Pittman will no longer be able to serve the people of House District 99,” she said in a statement. 
The House Democratic Caucus temporarily suspended Pittman’s caucus membership in October and she was also stripped of her committee assignments by chamber leadership. 
“This conduct is unacceptable and falls well below the standard expected of anyone serving in the Oklahoma House of Representatives,” said Republican House Speaker Kyle Hilbert. 
The governor has 30 days to set dates for a special election.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)A divided NC Board of Elections voted along party lines Wednesday to take a broad look at administrative rules for absentee ballots. 
The result could be stricter rules on what kinds of errors voters will be required to correct in order for their votes to count.  
The board won’t make any changes to rules or practices before the March 3 primary. 
The decision to reconsider how to address mail-in ballot mistakes stems from the settlement of a federal lawsuit brought by the NCGOP, the Republican National Committee and a voter over how absentee ballots county elections officials should handle ballots that are not sealed in the proper envelope. 
Absentee ballot instructions say ballots should be sealed in an inner envelope, then placed in an outer envelope for return to county elections offices. 
Former state elections director Karen Brinson Bell told county officials in 2021 it was okay if voters did not seal their ballots in the inner envelope – that their votes should still be counted. The state Republican Party and the Republican National Committee objected and asked the state Board of Elections for an official ruling in 2024. The board, then with a Democratic majority, unanimously endorsed Brinson Bell’s position.
Republicans sued in federal court. The suit was dismissed in December as the reconstituted, Republican-majority Board of Elections and Republican plaintiffs agreed that the board would reconsider its 2024 decision.
After a free-wheeling debate, the board voted 3-2, with Republicans in the majority, to consider not only a change to envelope rules, but a potential rewrite of other rules for absentee ballot errors and which mistakes voters would need to fix.  
Democrats on the board worried about unnecessarily penalizing voters.
“Nobody should deprive a person of their vote on the basis of a non-material error,” said Democrat Jeff Carmon. 
Republican Bob Rucho said it’s the voter’s responsibility to follow instructions. If the instructions are too confusing, he said, it’s the board’s responsibility to clarify them.
Voter challenge hearing next week
The board postponed consideration of a challenge to Margot Dupre’s candidacy in the U.S. Senate Republican primary. 
Fayetteville resident Jerry Reinoehl brought the challenge. The address DuPre has on her voter registration and the address she used when she filed to run for office is for a UPS store in Charlotte. Voter registration applications require a residential address. Applicants can provide a separate mailing address if they don’t receive mail where they live. 
Reinoehl’s complaint alleges that Dupre is probably registered in Florida at an Ocala address.
Dupre is one of seven Republicans running in the GOP primary for the open U.S. Senate seat. 
The board voted to push the hearing to Feb. 4 after Dupre told them she didn’t have enough advance notice to find a lawyer. 
Dupre made a short statement asking for a continuance, then said she wouldn’t answer any questions without a lawyer. 
Reinoehl said after the meeting that he has been involved in election integrity efforts for years and is on the lookout for voters who use UPS store addresses as home addresses.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5071581-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-28 15:01:58.615647

Josh Hawley speaks to reporters at the governor's ham breakfast at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia on Aug. 15 , 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley on Tuesday called the shooting of an ICU nurse in Minneapolis “very troubling” and added that he welcomes investigations and hearings on the actions of Department of Homeland Security agents in the incident.
Video of the incident shows DHS agents pinning 37-year-old Alex Pretti to the ground and shooting him multiple times after disarming him. There is no video evidence that Pretti ever brandished his weapon, which he was licensed to carry.
In the uproar immediately following the incident, Missouri’s other senator, Eric Schmitt, defended DHS, accusing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz of engaging in a “war on law enforcement.” Schmitt’s comments came before President Donald Trump’s Monday call with Walz, and his announcement that “we’re going to de-escalate a little bit.”
Schmitt was traveling back to Washington Tuesday and was unavailable for comment.
Hawley said he agreed with Trump that it is time to “turn the temperature down” in Minnesota.
When asked about the legality of the shooting, Hawley drew on his experience as Missouri’s attorney general, saying that he oversaw many police raids and that they are always dangerous.
“I am a firm believer in qualified immunity for law enforcement,” Hawley said. “But qualified immunity isn’t total immunity. The test there is: what would a reasonable person have done in those circumstances.”
Hawley said he wouldn’t recommend people carry firearms into an area where law enforcement is known to be conducting an operation, but added that Pretti’s decision to do so did not violate any law. In Missouri, the senator noted, a person would not even need a concealed carry permit, which Pretti had.
Pretti’s death, the second of two fatal shootings by DHS personnel during the agency’s surge in Minnesota, is creating the potential for a government shutdown at the end of the week.
The Senate faces a Friday deadline to approve a package of six funding bills for federal agencies, but Democrats, and some Republicans, say they want to reconsider the DHS funding package in light of what they consider the agency’s overreach in Minnesota.
Hawley said he wants to fund the Department of Homeland Security and keep the government open. Still, he said he will defer to Majority Leader U.S. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., when it comes to delaying or amending funding for DHS.

The Aitken was the first English-language translation of the Bible printed in the United States in 1782.
This specific version of the Bible would have to be displayed in fourth, eighth and 10th grade classrooms, according to Senate Bill 388. Those grades are when students are taught about the American Revolution, said bill sponsor Sen. Amy Grady, R-Mason, a fourth grade teacher. 
Grady said separation of church and state as required under the U.S. Constitution would prohibit teachers from teaching out of the biblical text.
“The significance of this particular Bible has to do with historical significance, and it’s not religion-based, and it’s not saying the teacher has to use it to instruct from,” she said.
Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell
Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, attempted to amend the bill to include that  classrooms also be required to display Catholic American Bible.
“Isn’t it true that many Americans came to this country to flee religious persecution? I think they were fleeing your particular brand of Protestantism that’s reflected in this Bible,” Woelfel said to Grady during debate on the Senate floor.  
Sen. Ryan Weld, R-Brooke
Woelfel received support from Sen. Ryan Weld, R-Brooke, who said that including the Catholic version of the Bible, which has 46 books, compared to the protestant Bible’s 39 books. 
“I think it’s important for a historical context to also have the Catholic Bible, not just as a Catholic but as a historian as well, for students who are part of these classrooms,” Weld said.
Sen. T. Kevan Bartlett, R-Kanawha, opposed the amendment, stressing that the Aitken Bible would provide “significant historical context” for West Virginia students.
Del. Kevan Bartlett, R-Kanawha
“It even lets the students see what printing looked like in the 18th century,” he said. 
 Woelfel’s amendment was voted down 8-25. Six Republican Senators joined the Senate’s two Democratic members to vote in support of the amendment. 
According to the bill, public funds are prohibited from being used to purchase the Aitken Bible. Schools can accept and use private donations to purchase the Aitken Bible.
The measure also requires the state’s charter schools to display the Aitken Bible.

(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)While Alaska school districts are seeing improvements in kindergarten to third grade students’ reading proficiency, which officials credit to the Alaska Reads Act, some districts are struggling to access state managed funds for a federal grant program aimed at supporting literacy programs, teacher development, and student learning.
Lawmakers with the House Education Committee heard from two district superintendents about the successes and challenges of the Comprehensive Literacy State Development grant program — which in 2024 awarded $50 million to Alaska schools over five years. 
In 2025, roughly half of Alaska’s districts, or 27 school districts, qualified for these grant funds administered through the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development, according to the department. 
The program is aimed at advancing literacy for children from birth through 12th grade students, including pre-literacy skills, reading and writing. The program focuses on districts with disadvantaged children, including those living in poverty, English language learners and students with disabilities.
While all Alaska districts are required by state law to implement the Alaska Read’s Act, the policy did not come with additional state funding, said Rep. Rebecca Himschoot, I-Sitka, co-chair of the education committee, in an interview on Monday. She said some districts are struggling to fund the kindergarten through third grade reading initiatives. “I would like to see us supporting schools so that everybody gets the support they need to implement the law the way it was written,” she said.
The program isn’t new, but it has more money and it’s funding more districts now. In 2019, nearly one third of Alaska districts were awarded $25 million over five years, according to DEED. 
“The literacy grant is a really powerful tool that is going to help the districts that it’s in, a lot,” Himschoot said. “I’ve heard a lot of gratitude from superintendents about having this opportunity for those who have it, but we did hear about some bumps in the rollout of it.”
District officials’ testimony prompted Himschoot to send a list of questions to DEED about how the grant is managed. 
Michael Robbins, superintendent of the Bristol Bay Borough School District, which serves approximately 135 students, said the grant has been crucial for implementing the Alaska Reads Act, particularly supporting teachers’ training professional development, which helps retention. “The grant supports training, coaching and leadership development grounded in research-based instruction, including the science of reading,” he said. 
“It creates consistency across classrooms in schools, helps prevent problems before they grow, and ensure that limited resources are utilized where that matters most,” Robbins said.
But Robbins said in implementing the grant, districts need more “clear, timely and reasonable guidance around allowable use of grant funds” from DEED.
He said the district would like to use the money for professional services vendors to provide training to teachers, and funding to attend conferences. “The approval process has been particularly cumbersome as some districts have had to resubmit their application multiple times, which takes valuable time from our grant leaders and administrators, as well as delaying the implementation of important activities,” he said.
Officials with DEED did not attend the legislative hearing, but department spokesperson Bryan Zadalis said by email on Monday that the department recognizes the importance of clear guidance, which is communicated through multiple channels including webinars and office hours. “DEED also aligns state-level guidance with federal updates as they are released to ensure accuracy and compliance, which can at times require sequencing information rather than issuing it prematurely,” he said. 
In addition, Robbins, who formerly served as the superintendent of the Ketchikan Gateway Borough School District, said that that district did not qualify for grant funding. “The need was there, but the resources are not,” he said. “We need to find ways for all districts and all students to have access to the same level of support and opportunity.”
Robyn Taylor is superintendent of the Petersburg School District which serves approximately 420 students, and was awarded $350,000 per year through the grant program. She testified to lawmakers and echoed the need for equity in supporting reading programs across Alaska’s school districts. She said Petersburg still continues to have challenges with implementing the Alaska Reads Act, which she called “a real tension.” 
“In Petersburg alone, between FY 25 and FY 26 we eliminated one of our three elementary reading interventionist positions, positions that were directly supporting Reads Act implementation and student outcomes,” she said. She said the district was told that CLSD funds were for supplementing programs not replacing funding. 
“(The) restriction makes it difficult to use this grant to maintain positions or systems that are already working but are no longer financially sustainable under current funding structures,” she said. 
Taylor and Himschoot both emphasized that districts who did not qualify for funding need support with the administrative work to apply. They said some schools should have easily qualified for the funding, but didn’t in part because they lack proper documentation of their students’ need for free or reduced school meals, which is one of the federal poverty guidelines. “It’s not that they don’t have kids in need,” Himschoot said. “It’s that they haven’t been identified through the paperwork, because they don’t have the capacity in their district to go chase that down.”
Zadalis said the grant process is a competitive one. He said the primary source of education funding is through the state’s funding formula, but districts may also access state or federal funding through other grants focused on literacy efforts. 
Taylor said Petersburg students are making gains in reading proficiency, and the district is committed to continuing improvements beyond the grant cycle. “What we are asking for is greater flexibility, clearer and earlier guidance,” she said. “And increased trust in districts to make decisions that reflect local context and student needs.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Higher teacher pay and lower class sizes topped Oklahoma educators’ list of needs in public schools, a state Department of Education survey found.
Parents, 5,000 of whom also took the survey, agreed that quality teachers, adequate funding and small class sizes are among their top priorities for their children’s schools. Both parents and teachers emphasized a desire for family involvement in students’ education, according to the survey, which the Education Department and the Oklahoma State School Boards Association conducted in November and December.
The 5,800 responding educators expressed numerous concerns for disruptive student behavior and called for more support in managing it.
Several survey answers urged the state to raise Oklahoma teacher wages, last increased in 2023, to retain and recruit more traditionally trained educators. Doing so, some said, would lower class sizes, improve instruction and help manage classroom disruptions.
State Superintendent Lindel Fields said the survey responses played a “critical role” in determining what legislative priorities he would present to state lawmakers.

In a hearing Monday, Fields requested a mostly flat education budget but encouraged House and Senate legislators to focus on school security, teacher development, school leader training, improving literacy and raising first-year teacher salaries.
Multiple survey respondents, though, called for higher wages across the board, not only for first-year educators. Several said veteran teachers should be rewarded.
“We have thousands of certified teachers who are opting out of teaching because of the volatile environment,” one respondent wrote. “Experience cannot be undervalued or cast out. We need experienced teachers to lead new graduates and help us reduce class sizes. So many have left.”
The average salary of Oklahoma teachers is $61,330, enough for a middle-of-the-pack ranking among its bordering states, according to Education Department data. However, Oklahoma ranks second-highest in average teacher salaries when accounting for cost of living, the state agency’s data shows.
Oklahoma’s average for first-year teacher pay, $41,152 a year, ranks near the bottom in the region even when considering cost of living.
About 11% of Oklahoma public school teachers left the profession last school year, Fields told lawmakers in the Monday budget hearing. The state has 725 fewer teachers in public schools than the year before.
“The challenge with 11% leaving is we’re not filling the pipeline to adequately replace those that are leaving,” Fields told lawmakers. “So, a little work there would go a long way.”
Parents told the Education Department which skills they most want their children to learn before graduating from high school.
Financial literacy was at the top of the list followed by critical thinking, reading and literacy, life skills and career readiness.
They also want their children to learn to communicate effectively, have strong math skills, build strong social and emotional skills, become technologically savvy, and understand civic and historical knowledge, the survey found.
Some parents complained that sports, technology and standardized testing have too great a role in schools. Others gave a more favorable view or didn’t mention them as an issue.
Teachers also gave mixed responses on state testing. Some called for it to be eliminated, and others suggested it be reformed. Technology in education and extending the school year had conflicting responses, too, with some teachers in favor and others opposed.

Ron DeSantis and Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas announced Wednesday that Florida will participate in the federal school choice tax credit program.

Ron DeSantis announced Wednesday.
During a news conference celebrating national School Choice Week in Valrico, DeSantis and Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas announced Florida’s participation in the federal tax credit program established by the One Big Beautiful Bill last summer.
Florida’s participation in the program will begin Jan. 1, 2027, DeSantis said. Floridians will be able to receive a tax credit of $1,700 per year if they contribute to the program.

Taxpayers can receive a credit of up to $1,700 for contributions made to scholarship funding organizations (organizations that disperse money to families to pay for education) that would otherwise have been owed to the government in Federal income taxes. A tax credit reduces the amount of Federal income tax owed dollar-for-dollar (unlike a deduction, which decreases taxable income).

“I think this could be something that’s really meaningful. I think it will supplement the great stuff we’re already doing here. Probably is going to be pretty groundbreaking in states that have not yet gone down the road of school choice,” DeSantis said.
DeSantis made the announcement at Grace Christian School.
“I think this is going to supplement our efforts in a good way. What we don’t want is the schools to just simply see this money is there and raise the tuition. That’s not what we want. We want the parents to actually benefit, so we’ll be watching on that,” DeSantis said.
The state offers its own tax credit scholarship, too. That program provides tax credits for those who contribute to scholarship funding organizations, which then pass the money on to parents using the scholarship program.
For students to qualify to receive funds from the federal program, their family cannot earn greater than 300% of the area’s median gross income. Florida’s median household income is around $76,000.
Families may spend the scholarship on private school tuition, public school tutoring, and support services for students with disabilities.
“I want to commend the president and Secretary [Linda] McMahon for implementing this as well as dismantling the bureaucracy that is the United States Department of Education,” Kamoutsas said. “And by opting in to this program, Florida will now enable more low-income families to pursue private schools, homeschooling options, and other educational opportunities that best meet their child’s needs.”
In 2023, Florida expanded its school choice program, making it universally available. Before, the state voucher program was based on family income.
As of Tuesday, nearly half of states had announced they would participate in the program, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The federal government indicated the program will especially help states like Louisiana and Pennsylvania, which have waitlists for tutoring programs and school choice vouchers, respectively.

The song from the rock legend comes just days after federal immigration agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA, on Saturday. He is the second fatality in a month, following poet and mother Renee Good, who was killed about a mile away in her car on Jan. 7. Both victims are honored by name in Springsteen’s lyrics, with the refrain, “We’ll remember the names of those who died; On the streets of Minneapolis.”
In a statement, Springsteen said he wrote the song on Saturday following Pretti’s killing and dedicated it to “the people of Minneapolis, our innocent immigrant neighbors and in memory of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.”
The title of the song echoes his 1993 song, “Streets of Philadelphia,” written for the film “Philadelphia” about the AIDS epidemic.
The song’s release underscores the cultural and historical significance of the resistance to the violent federal siege on the state still underway, which has mobilized tens of thousands in opposition and captured international attention through bystander videos documenting the federal agents’ brutality against immigrants and American citizens alike.
The song pays homage to the signature symbols of resistance — the whistle and the phone — which counter Stephen Miller and Kristi Noem’s “dirty lies.”
President Trump promised “reckoning and retribution is coming” for Minnesota and sent 3,000 federal agents and officers to the state in the “largest (Department of Homeland Security) operation ever.” But the operation, labeled a military occupation by local Democratic leaders, has turned public opinion sharply against the president and ICE.






Lyrics to ‘Streets of Minneapolis’ 
Through the winter’s ice and cold
Down Nicollet Avenue
A city aflame fought fire and ice
‘Neath an occupier’s boots
King Trump’s private army from the DHS
Guns belted to their coats
Came to Minneapolis to enforce the law
Or so their story goes
Against smoke and rubber bullets
By the dawn’s early light
Citizens stood for justice
Their voices ringing through the night
And there were bloody footprints
Where mercy should have stood
And two dead left to die on snow-filled streets
Alex Pretti and Renee Good
Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice
Singing through the bloody mist
We’ll take our stand for this land
And the stranger in our midst
Here in our home they killed and roamed
In the winter of ’26
We’ll remember the names of those who died
On the streets of Minneapolis
Trump’s federal thugs beat up on
His face and his chest
Then we heard the gunshots
And Alex Pretti lay in the snow, dead
Their claim was self defense, sir
Just don’t believe your eyes
It’s our blood and bones
And these whistles and phones
Against Miller and Noem’s dirty lies
Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice
Crying through the bloody mist
We’ll remember the names of those who died
On the streets of Minneapolis
Now they say they’re here to uphold the law
But they trample on our rights
If your skin is black or brown my friend
You can be questioned or deported on sight
In chants of ICE out now
Our city’s heart and soul persists
Through broken glass and bloody tears
On the streets of Minneapolis
Oh our Minneapolis, I hear your voice
Singing through the bloody mist
Here in our home they killed and roamed
In the winter of ’26
We’ll take our stand for this land
And the stranger in our midst
We’ll remember the names of those who died
On the streets of Minneapolis
We’ll remember the names of those who died
On the streets of Minneapolis",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-12.28.26-PM-1024x632.png,,,2026-01-28 14:01:13.994639

Jack Stewart, R-Yukon, and Sen. Kendal Sacchieri, R-Blanchard, await votes on a veto override during the Senate session on Thursday, May 29, 2025. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Thirty-four lawmakers are asking Oklahoma’s high court to prevent a state agency from providing driver’s license information to a Virginia-based nonprofit.
The lawmakers, including Sen. Kendal Sacchieri, R-Blanchard, are asking the Oklahoma Supreme Court to prevent Service Oklahoma from sharing driver’s license data with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. 
The Virginia-based nonprofit operates a technology platform that is used by 44 states and allows officials to cross-check driver’s license information to determine if motorists have active driver’s licenses in other states.
Service Oklahoman intends to give the nonprofit access to some driver’s license information, including names, dates of birth and  partial social security numbers, in mid-February. Driver photos and biometric information will not be exchanged.
Sacchieri and the other lawmakers filed a lawsuit late Tuesday to block the data sharing.
“Once transmitted, the data cannot be retrieved from AAMVA’s system or from other states that may access or rely upon the record,” the lawsuit said. “The transmission therefore creates irreparable injury to statutory rights, constitutional structure, and personal-data privacy that cannot be remedied after the fact.”
The agency’s decision was not authorized by the Legislature, the suit said.
The lawsuit asks the Oklahoma Supreme Court to prohibit the information from being shared and find that the agency may not share the information absent legislative authorization.
Service Oklahoma said it could not comment on the lawsuit, but said the system, more commonly known as State-to-State or S2S, is used exclusively by state driver’s licensing agencies and does not allow federal access.
Service Oklahoma is permitted to share records with other states as part of routine license administration, the agency said.
The system does not store or centralize full records, the agency said.
By the end of 2026, Service Oklahoma said 48 states are expected to utilize the system, which has been in existence for two decades.
Oklahoma provides residents with the option to either obtain a federally-compliant REAL ID license or one that is non-compliant. A REAL ID license, which contains a gold star in the upper right corner, signifies that it meets minimum federal security standards.
Oklahoma’s non-compliant licenses allow motorists to drive within the state, but are not recognized to access federal property or to fly domestically.
Sacchieri said the suit is aimed at stopping the transfer of any information, but especially the information of those who sought a non-compliant license.
She said the association is private, but works with and is an arm of the Department of Homeland Security.
Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, is among the plaintiffs seeking to block the sharing of information.
“We just can’t trust the federal government right now,” Boren said.
She said the state should keep the promises made to its residents and keep the information private.

Jim Pillen remarks in a tele-town hall drew criticism from disability advocates and families.,"Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen before his State of the State address in the Capitol on Jan. 15, 2026. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen’s office has addressed his recent tele-town hall comments that triggered criticism from disability advocates and families. 
Last week, reporters tried to ask Pillen about his use of the term “libtards” three times during the tele-town hall, but a spokesperson stepped in before the governor could answer. 
Pillen, through a statement on Wednesday, said that he has always supported “Nebraska’s developmentally disabled community.” The governor’s spokesperson pointed to him clearing the “long-stalled DD waitlist, speeding service access to Nebraska families who had waited for years, and substantially increased special education funding for our schools.”
“He is a fierce advocate for the inherent dignity and value of all people,” said Laura Strimple, Pillen’s communications director. 
Strimple said the governor didn’t direct his comment to the developmentally disabled community or their families, “nor did the thought ever cross his mind.”

“Rather, he was referring to the group of liberals who continually dress in Handmaid’s Tale outfits as a form of political protest and disrupt official events, as well as other left-wing radicals who have poisoned our political discourse and sowed division throughout our society,” Strimple said. 
Pillen tele-town hall on property tax relief, other priorities veers into tough talk against critics

State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, in a social media post, said, “The governor is missing the point. Ableist slurs are harmful because they equate disability with something contemptible.” She criticized his response, saying, “Disabled Nebraskans deserve leadership that takes their dignity seriously.” 
Pillen’s Democratic challenger for governor, former State Sen. Lynne Walz of Fremont, said the comments were “disappointing.”
The nonprofit Disability Rights Nebraska said it finds “the repeated use of this term to be highly unprofessional and lacking in integrity.”
Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who often criticizes President Donald Trump on his tone and rhetoric, during a press conference last week said he had thoughts on Pillen’s comments but said, “I think I’ll just keep it to myself.”
Multi-state agribusinessman Charles Herbster, who is deciding whether to run against Pillen in a potential Republican primary election rematch, said in a social media statement that Pillen “​​deserves to be challenged on the words he uses” as it’s “part of the job.” 
“​​What was on full display is that he does not like being challenged on his authority or record.” The longtime Trump donor said, “I’ve said it before, he acts as if he has all the answers, and if you question him, you’re either a liar or a ‘libtard,’ in his words.”

Tiffany at a press conference in October 2025.  (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)President Donald Trump endorsed U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany for Wisconsin governor Tuesday evening, saying that the 7th Congressional District representative has “always been at my side.”
The endorsement gives another boost to Tiffany’s primary campaign, though he was already considered the frontrunner over Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann, who was the first candidate to join the open race. 
“A very successful Businessman, Family Farmer, and State Legislator, prior to becoming a distinguished United States Congressman, Tom is a Proven Leader who has dedicated his life to serving his Community,” Trump said in his Truth Social post. 
Trump said in his Truth Social post endorsing Tiffany that Wisconsin is a “very special place to me in that we had a BIG Presidential Election Win just over one year ago” and noted he had previously endorsed Tiffany in his campaign for Congress. Trump won Wisconsin over former Vice President Kamala Harris by a little over 29,000 votes in 2024. It was the second time a Republican had carried the state since 1984; the first time was Trump’s 2016 win in Wisconsin.
“As your next Governor, Tom will continue to work tirelessly to Grow the Economy, Cut Taxes and Regulations, Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A., Champion American Energy DOMINANCE, Keep our Border SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, Ensure LAW AND ORDER, Strengthen our Brave Military/Veterans, Advance Election Integrity, Advocate for the Working Men and Women of Wisconsin, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment. He will fight to advance Common Sense Values, and put WISCONSIN, AND AMERICA, FIRST,” Trump said.
Tiffany, who has represented Wisconsin’s 7th CD since 2020, said he was honored to earn Trump’s endorsement. 
“Just one year into his second term, wages are rising, gas prices are down, our economy is growing, and our border is secure,” Tiffany said in a statement.
“For seven years, Democrat leadership has pushed our state in the wrong direction. As governor, I will make Wisconsin great again by lowering utility rates and property taxes, cutting burdensome red tape, rooting out waste and fraud, and restoring common-sense leadership to Madison.”
Earlier this week at a press conference, Tiffany highlighted his plan to eliminate the 400-year veto issued by Evers which extended a two-year increase in school districts’ authority to raise  school revenues for the next four centuries. He also said he would freeze property taxes should he become governor. Tiffany’s announcement was overshadowed by remarks he made about the recent shooting of Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse from Green Bay,  by federal Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. 
Tiffany said at the press conference that he hadn’t seen the video of the Pretti shooting. He followed up the next day with a social media post saying he would work with local, state and federal law enforcement to “remove criminal illegal aliens” and that Minnesota leaders should do the same.
“Cooperation is how you avoid tragic consequences. Deporting illegal aliens is how you make America safer. And waiting for the facts is how you avoid escalating the situation,” Tiffany said.
Bystander footage of the Pretti shooting shows him being pinned down by federal agents before being shot in the back and does not support Trump administration claims that he tried to assault or impede the agents.
The Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Devin Remiker issued a statement that tied Tiffany to a number of the actions taken under the Trump administration. 
“We agree with Donald Trump — Tom Tiffany has been by his side for all of it: ICE murdering Americans in the streets, the Big Ugly Bill, ending funding for the Affordable Care Act, invading Greenland, and raising everyday costs. Donald Trump just made Tom Tiffany the general election nominee, and we will stop him from bringing his chaotic and dangerous agenda in November,” Remiker said.
Tiffany has often aligned himself with the Trump administration throughout his time in office including as one of two Wisconsin members of Congress who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election results in two states. Prior to his time in Congress, Tiffany served in the Wisconsin Assembly and Senate. 
Trump has previously been involved in primaries in Wisconsin and carried significant influence.
During the 2022 Republican governor’s primary, Trump endorsed businessman Tim Michels over former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, who at the time was considered the frontrunner in the race. Michels went on to win that primary with 47% of the vote. Michels lost in the general election to Gov. Tony Evers by 3.5 percentage points. 
In 2024, Trump endorsed businessman U.S. Rep. Tony Wied, who won in a three-way primary that year and now represents Wisconsin’s 8th Congressional District.
The Schoemann campaign has not responded to a request for comment from the Wisconsin Examiner. 
The winner of the Aug. 11 Republican primary will face the winner of the Democratic primary on Nov. 3 this year. Several Democratic primary candidates issued reactions to Trump’s endorsement of Tiffany. 
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez said that “Wisconsinites know what ‘Trump–Tiffany leadership’ actually looks like. Higher health care costs. Cuts to Medicaid. Families squeezed by rent, groceries, and utility bills. Chaos and fear instead of safety. Those are their priorities. And we’re all paying the price.” 
Former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes said Trump endorsed Tiffany because “he’s been a rubber stamp for his agenda in Washington, giving tax cuts to the wealthiest while making life harder for families and farmers here at home.” 
“It’s time to reject Trump’s chaos and Tiffany’s Washington Way and get things done the Wisconsin Way. That’s what I’ll do as Governor,” Barnes said. 
Former Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. CEO Missy Hughes said that “Wisconsin needs a leader, not a sidekick.” 
Milwaukee Co. Exec. David Crowley sarcastically congratulated Tiffany, saying he “would be a great addition to Trump’s Board of Peace.” He posted an edited photo of Trump with notorious fictional villains Voldemort, Darth Vader and the Joker as well as President of Russia Vladimir Putin. 
Other candidates in the Democratic primary include state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and former Department of Administration Sec. Joel Brennan.

Chris Becker, the county’s prosecutor, held a press conference Wednesday morning to announce that Kornak was being charged with two counts of embezzlement of a vulnerable adult and a charge for false pretenses, according to both The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press.
House Oversight Committee continues hearings on alleged ethics concerns of Attorney General’s office

Kornak’s new legal troubles come after years of speculation and scrutiny from independent reporters, including former Detroit News reporter Charlie LeDuff, and Republican legislators who have drawn a line connecting dots to Kornak, the Democratic Party and Nessel.
Kornak was the party’s treasurer between 2019 and the spring of 2025. She was a member of Nessel’s transition committee when she was elected to office in 2018.
LeDuff and Republican members of the state House have for years accused Nessel and her office for burying an investigation into Kornak’s alleged abuse, which quietly wrapped up in 2022.
Nessel rebuffs ethics claims from Michigan House Oversight chair

On Tuesday, Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), the chair of the House Oversight Committee, said that the Michigan Attorney General’s office is “either wholly incompetent or it is corrupt” in a hearing of the Oversight Committee on ethics violations allegedly committed by Nessel.
AG spokesperson Kimberly Bush told the Advance on Tuesday, in an email request for comment that the committee “continues to conflate the Attorney General’s investigation with subsequent, separate investigations by other agencies that were predicated on separate allegations made by different complainants involving a different victim, that began only after the Attorney General’s investigation was concluded.”
The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday regarding the new charges against Kornak in Kent County.
Nessel’s office did open an investigation after LeDuff wrote about the issue in the summer of 2022, and a conflict wall was set up to isolate Nessel from the case. However, the case was requested to be closed later in the fall.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1483489085-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 14:01:13.994639

Thom Tillis (R-NC) speaks to reporters before a weekly Republican policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol Building on June 3, 2025 in Washington, DC. Tillis announced on Sunday that he will not seek reelection in 2026. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)North Carolina’s U.S. senators are calling for an investigation into a fatal shooting by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. 
The killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents on Saturday was the third shooting by immigration officers in Minneapolis in just as many weeks — and the second to end in death. 
Republican Sen. Ted Budd said in a Tuesday statement that he’s joining calls, including from North Carolina’s senior Sen. Thom Tillis, for an investigation on the shooting. 
“Given heavy-handed rhetoric and recent events, we have seen an erosion of trust in federal immigration officials growing among too many Americans,” Budd wrote on social media. 
He reiterated his support for President Donald Trump’s efforts on immigration and border control, but criticized statements by Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that Pretti should not have been carrying a weapon at the protest, which is lawful in Minnesota. 
“I’d also like to remind federal leaders that words matter,” Budd wrote. “Americans have a constitutional right to bear arms, and the mere possession of a firearm does not represent a threat justifying lethal force.” 
Earlier in the week, Tillis, a Republican who isn’t seeking reelection, pushed for a “thorough and impartial” investigation, calling it a basic standard expected following an officer-involved shooting. 
“Any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump’s legacy,” Tillis wrote in a Sunday social media post. 
The incident and its aftermath have led to increased criticism of Noem, including from her own party.
No Republicans voted against her confirmation last year. 
“What she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying. She should be out of a job,” U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis told reporters on Tuesday. “It’s making the president look bad on policies that he won on.”
Speaking to reporters as he left the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, Tillis did not hesitate to speak his mind on the former South Dakota governor, though he avoided criticizing the president. 
He declined to explicitly answer if he thinks Noem should step down, but called her “incompetent” and “amateurish.”
“I think if Noem looks at her body of work… I can’t think of any point of pride over the last year,” Tillis said. “She has taken this administration into the ground on an issue that we should own.”
But the president dismissed Tillis’ criticism, describing him and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Republican from Alaska, as “losers.”
“They’re both terrible senators. One is gone and the other should be gone,” Trump said in an ABC News interview on Wednesday. “What Murkowski says — she’s always against the Republicans anyway. And Tillis decided to drop out. So you know, he lost his voice once he did that.”
On the House side, three of the four Democrats in North Carolina’s congressional delegation have signed an impeachment resolution against Noem. 
Rep. Don Davis, the lone holdout, said in a letter to constituents that Noem must be held accountable. He’s running for reelection in the state’s most competitive congressional district later this year. 
Former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said on social media on Tuesday that when he served as the mayor of Charlotte, the city conducted extensive reviews of police shootings.
“If this had happened in Charlotte, we’d probably be trying to settle this case without going to trial because the jury would kill us in a civil case,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2217838562-594x594-Tillis.jpg,,,2026-01-28 12:59:51.102120

Janet Mills and other state and local leaders met Wednesday to discuss the ways they’re pushing back on unlawful immigration enforcement — ongoing lawsuits, legislation and a potential fund to help the families of those detained or those too fearful to leave home. 
They also rebuked the Trump administration for not communicating about its operation in Maine, despite continued demands from the governor and others for arrest numbers, warrants and basic information about who is being detained.
“We’ve heard nothing so far,” Mills said Tuesday, during the meeting of leaders at Portland City Hall where she also reiterated her request. 
Lack of communication, clarity 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Monday that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have arrested more than 200 people in Maine since launching its operation last week, after announcing earlier arrest data via Fox News. That figure has not been independently verified by Maine Morning Star, nor community organizers or state leaders as DHS has declined to share specifics. 
“When we’re getting our news about what’s going on as mayors, as elected officials and as neighbors from Fox News and government press release and diatribes on Truth Social, that’s not good governance,” Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) said. “That’s a tantrum.” 
In the recent DHS statement, the agency characterized the people arrested as “illegal aliens.” However, several lawyers and family members of those who have been detained say they are people who are lawfully present in the U.S. with permission to work and no criminal record. 
Because of that, Portland Mayor Mark Dion asked Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey if his office could put out a clarification for the community regarding what protections immigrants with work permits have.  
“Even with the rules of the road being made clear,” Frey responded, “I can’t sit here and guarantee that the federal government is going to follow those rules.” 
Frey condemned the Trump administration for not treating state and local agencies as partners and said ICE’s recent actions amount to “constitutionally deficient enforcement” undertaken by “masked, nameless, faceless people.”

Actions taken or being considered by the state
Frey encouraged Mainers to report potential civil rights violations and excessive force by immigration agents to a tipline his office launched earlier this week. 
He also highlighted ongoing litigation the state is involved with — such as fighting against the termination of Temporary Protected Status for immigrants from several nations and President Donald Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship. 
In the immediate future, members of Maine’s immigrant community are now also facing the threat of eviction, said Portland Mayor Mark Dion.
Based on data gathered from South Portland, Westbrook and Portland, 653 households are under threat of eviction due to either their primary breadwinner being detained or not going to work out of fear of being detained, he said. 
“Eviction is going to be the new tsunami,” Dion said.
With other mayors echoing his concerns, Dion asked Mills to create a fund to help immigrant families facing eviction, especially in light of the strain already on emergency housing shelters. 
There are also several bills the state Legislature is currently considering to try to curb unlawful ICE action. Daughtry highlighted one she is co-sponsoring, which has a public hearing on Thursday, that would prohibit the disclosure of non-public records without proper judicial review, aiming to protect places like schools and hospitals. 
During Trump’s second term, there have been instances of people being erroneously detained and deported. A proposal from Senate Assistant Majority Leader Jill Duson (D-Cumberland) seeks to prevent that from occurring in Maine by creating a right to emergency review.
The governor also called on Congress to immediately bring Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem before them for a public hearing and to cut off further funding for ICE “until their lawless tactics and dangerous behavior cease.” Congress is now hurtling toward a partial government shutdown. 
Both Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree and independent U.S. Sen. Angus King said they won’t vote for a bill that includes DHS funding amid aggressive immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden voted for that spending package despite most other Democrats, Pingree included, rejecting it. Maine Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins has resisted calls to withhold funding for DHS, instead saying the recent killing underscores the need to provide money to equip federal agents with training and body cameras. 
Local perspective 
ICE’s actions are not making Maine safer; they’re doing the opposite, state leaders and several city mayors agreed during the meeting at Portland City Hall.  
The majors of six cities detailed stories they’ve heard from residents, including people going through legal immigration processes who have been watched by federal agents, fearful of leaving their homes even with documents proving their status in hand. 
“Our police officers in Maine don’t wear masks,” said Auburn Mayor Jeffrey Harmon. “In a free society, when they’re taking action on behalf of the government, people need to be able to know who it was, so that they can raise their concerns and they can be properly addressed.”
Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said ICE’s tactics are re-traumatizing many people who fled unsafe countries. 
Several of the mayors said residents have closed their restaurants and stopped sending their children to school. And, U.S. citizens filming ICE and offering support by delivering meals and carpooling, have also faced threats. 
South Portland Mayor Elyse Tipton said the way to ensure public safety and dignity for residents “is to build a strong community in partnership and not in fear.”
Throughout the first week of ICE’s immigration operation in Maine, community organizers fielded more than 4,000 calls, up nearly 75% from the week prior, reporting 529 possible agency sightings throughout the state.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5509-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 12:59:51.102120

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia Democrats on Wednesday introduced a package of bills designed to curb federal immigration enforcement activities in the commonwealth. The lawmakers framed their effort as a public safety measure to protect the state’s immigrant communities and other residents, following deadly clashes between ICE agents and protesters in Minnesota and as media polls show Americans’ growing discontent with the federal government’s aggressive campaign to rout out undocumented immigrants. 
The proposals, which have been filed but not yet advanced through committee, would restrict where and how federal immigration and border patrol agents can operate and limit cooperation from state and local authorities.
At a morning news conference at the state Capitol in Richmond, Democratic lawmakers said the legislation aims to prevent what they described as aggressive, unaccountable federal enforcement actions from taking place in Virginia communities and to ensure immigrants and other residents can access schools, hospitals, courthouses and polling places without fear.
“House Democrats are here for one reason. We’re charged with protecting all Virginians,” Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, told reporters. “It’s Virginia citizens, all Virginia residents, our neighbors, and keeping our communities safe.”
Simon tied the legislative push to the deaths of Alex Pretti, a hospital ICU nurse who cared for veterans, and Renee Nicole Good, a Minnesota mother of three, during recent federal enforcement actions.
“Alex Pretti, a VA hospital ICU nurse, was just trying to help a woman who’d been knocked to the ground, he was shot in the back 10 times by federal agents. He was shot like a dog in the street. Renee Good, a mother of three, shot in the head,” Simon said. 
Democrats did not provide a response Wednesday on a reported federal plan to establish an ICE detention facility in Hanover County, nor did they elaborate in details on the bills they expect to advance this session. 
The legislative push comes as immigration enforcement has become one of the earliest tests of Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s administration, following Democrats’ takeover of statewide offices and both chambers of the General Assembly. 
Shortly after her Jan. 17 inauguration as Virginia’s 75th governor, Spanberger moved quickly to reverse a signature Republican immigration policy by rescinding former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order that had urged state police and corrections officers to help carry out federal immigration enforcement, a step that advocates said fueled fear in immigrant communities.
But Spanberger’s move did not end existing agreements between state or local agencies with the federal government. 
Democratic lawmakers said their own proposals are designed to draw clearer boundaries between federal immigration enforcement and state and local institutions, particularly schools, hospitals, courthouses and polling places.
“We can enforce the law and respect the Constitution,” Simon said. “We hold criminals accountable without terrorizing communities. That’s what real public safety looks like.”
 Bills restricting enforcement locations and cooperation

Several of the new proposals were introduced by Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, who said they are intended to prevent immigration enforcement from interfering with access to essential services and democratic participation.
Lopez’s House Bill 1440 would prohibit federal immigration enforcement in certain “protected areas” owned or operated by the state or local governments, including hospitals and health care facilities, schools at all levels, offices of commonwealth’s attorneys and other locations designated by the attorney general.
Under the proposal, employees of those facilities could not knowingly allow federal immigration enforcement into nonpublic areas for enforcement purposes. Violations would be punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor, with limited exceptions.
HB 1441 would restrict state and local law-enforcement officers from assisting or cooperating 
with federal immigration enforcement operations, unless they are acting under a valid judicial warrant, subpoena or detainer, or are otherwise required by law.
And HB 1442 would prohibit immigration enforcement activity within 40 feet of polling places, locations where election results are being certified, or recount sites. Lopez said the legislation is meant to ensure that voters are not deterred from participating in elections.
“Public safety includes protecting the most fundamental right in a democracy, the right to vote without fear,” Lopez said. “What we have seen from ICE agents is intimidation.”
 Courthouse protections

Another proposal, HB 650 by Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, would restrict civil arrests inside courthouses. At the Chesterfield County Courthouse alone, at least 14 undocumented individuals were arrested last summer, drawing sharp rebukes from public officials, civil rights groups and lawmakers but praise from former Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
The measure would prohibit such arrests of people who are attending court proceedings, traveling to court or leaving court, including witnesses and family members, unless the arresting authority presents a judicial warrant or order that has been reviewed by a designated official.
Violations would be punishable as contempt of court.
“Courthouses should be places of justice, not fear,” Callsen said at the news conference. “People have to be able to enter a courthouse to testify, attend hearings and comply with the law without worrying that they’ll be snatched, detained or disappear on their way in the door.”
Callsen said the bill is aimed at preventing a breakdown in the justice system when people are afraid to participate.
“When people are afraid to show up, crimes go unreported,” she said. “That is not what public safety is about.”
 Data, masking and cooperation limits

Other bills filed this session address transparency and cooperation with federal authorities.
HB 7, introduced in December by former Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, now a state senator, would prohibit most state and federal law-enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings while performing official duties, with exceptions for health protection and tactical operations. 
The bill would create criminal penalties, allow civil lawsuits against officers who violate the rule and eliminate sovereign immunity as a defense.
And HB 1438 by Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, would prohibit state and local agencies from entering into agreements that authorize officers to perform federal immigration enforcement functions. Existing agreements would have to be terminated by Sept. 1, 2026. 
The bill would also limit inquiries into a person’s immigration status and create a cause of action for violations.
And Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, said data privacy and constitutional protections are also central to the legislative effort.
“No one should have their personal information swept up, shared or misused without due process or without their consent,” Tran said. “Our legislation is proactive. It’s responsible, and quite frankly, it’s our duty.”
 Senate counterparts

Across the hall, Sen. Saddam Azlan Salim, D-Fairfax, announced earlier this week that he introduced companion legislation, including bills mirroring the courthouse arrest restrictions and facial covering bans.
A third bill, SB 783, would limit agreements between state or local agencies and federal immigration authorities and expand data-collection requirements under the Virginia Community Policing Act to track the presence and actions of federal immigration officers during stops.
In a statement, Salim sharply criticized recent federal enforcement actions.
“ICE has murdered another Minnesotan, and we need to call it what it is: state violence, plain and simple,” Salim said, adding that his bills are intended to ensure that “no agency, no badge, and no president is above the law or the value of a human life.”
Republican leaders pushed back on the Democratic proposals Wednesday, arguing the focus should remain on economic issues rather than challenging immigration enforcement. 
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, and Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, said Democrats are straying from an affordability agenda that leaders in both parties have identified as a top priority this session. 
“That should be the focus,” McDougle said. “Not political games like gerrymandering, not political games like fighting with D.C.”
Asked about the Democratic measures, Kilgore said, “Virginia has absolutely no say in what the federal government is doing.”

Zach Nunn spoke to Republicans at the Westside Conservative Club gathering at the Machine Shed in Urbandale Jan. 28, 2026. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn told Republicans Wednesday he does not support the Affordable Care Act – but that without an extension of enhanced tax credits that subsidize premiums, more than 126,000 Iowans will be unable to afford health care.
Nunn, who represents Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, was one of 17 House Republicans, and the only member of the state’s all-GOP delegation, to vote for a three-year extension of the federal health care subsidies earlier in January. The Iowa Republican, who is running for reelection in 2026 in a seat expected to be one of the most competitive in the nation, told conservatives gathered at a meeting of the Westside Conservative Club Wednesday he did not support the ACA.
“Let’s make no bones about it: The ACA is one of the most destructive health care plans out there,” Nunn said. “Now the only thing worse than that, if we had no health plan and here’s where I have a challenge.”
The ACA tax credits, which were approved during the COVID-19 pandemic and extended through the Inflation Reduction Act under former President Joe Biden, expired at the end of 2025. The 43-day government shutdown in the fall of last year was largely centered on these tax credits, as Senate Democrats sought to extend the subsidies before the expiration date.
The shutdown ended without action on the issue. While the Senate voted on a measure related to ACA premium tax credits in December — one of the agreements brokered by Democrats to end the shutdown — it did not advance, and the House measure Nunn supported has not been taken up in the Senate.
The tax credits expired at the beginning of the year, and a solution on the issue has not yet been reached. As negotiations continue, premiums have risen for people receiving health insurance through the ACA-established Health Insurance Marketplaces, and federal data shows fewer people are receiving coverage because of the changes.
Nunn said he supports the larger health care package advanced by House Republicans in December as the solution to lowering health care costs. He said the plan would allow more flexibility for employers in offering Health Savings Account plans for workers, increase transparency on reimbursement rates, and make sure patients are receiving more support than insurance companies.
He said Republicans who crafted the proposal told leadership the measure needed to be advanced in November, “and then December, and then January.” He said while he respects House Speaker Mike Johnson’s work in leading the Republican majority in the House, Nunn said it was “frustrating” that no bill has moved forward on the House floor to lower health care costs.
As long as Republicans are not moving forward with “a new path” on health care, the Iowans currently covered by ACA plans are facing higher costs that could force them to move out of their apartments or keep them from affording food, Nunn said.
“I want the ACA gone as much as any of you, but I’m not going to leave 126,000 Iowans to wait for Congress to get its job done,” Nunn said. “Because while we can lead on that legislation, if the Senate will not pass it, then it’s effectively doing the worst of both worlds. … When it comes to representing 750,000 Iowans, I’m not gonna leave 100,000 in the lurch while Congress tries to do its job.”
According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly 137,000 Iowans were enrolled on Marketplace plans in 2025.
Nunn spoke to the Westside Conservative Club at the Machine Shed in Urbandale — a group he visited at the same location Tuesday, when he and other members of Iowa’s congressional delegation joined President Donald Trump on a stop before Trump gave a speech in Clive.  The president told Iowans in his Tuesday address he wants to lower health care costs by distributing funding currently going to insurers through the ACA directly to patients, as part of a plan that also includes lowering prescription drug costs and increasing price transparency requirements.
Nunn calls for independent review of Minnesota shootings
Nunn also touched on another issue brought up during the president’s visit to Iowa the day earlier — the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minnesota during protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he spoke with Trump Monday about allowing independent state investigations of the incidents as well as reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota.
Answering a question from a reporter Tuesday about pulling out U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents from Minnesota, Trump said, “We’ll do whatever’s appropriate.”
Nunn said he believes there needs to be a “a full account, an independent review” of the incidents in Minnesota, and said Trump also has said he wants to “hold folks accountable.” But Nunn said that means “let’s hold folks accountable on all sides,” criticizing some protesters who interrupted church services in Minnesota as a part of anti-ICE actions.
He also criticized protesters who demonstrated against Trump at the speech in Iowa yesterday, saying some individuals made comments to his wife, 6-year-old daughter of color and other children that were “harmful,” “hurtful” and “intolerant.”
“I’m all for First Amendment rights to free speech. I’m all for you showing up in negative four degrees — I’m guessing they were colder than I was by the end of the day. But what I’m not for is what I saw yesterday: walking out in the middle of a motorcade and almost getting hit. Standing on the street and screaming profanities at children.”

Last year, a GOP lawmaker attempted to pass a bill that would have banned anonymous complaints against law enforcement officers.
While the measure passed in the House, it never moved in the Senate.
Now that bill (HB 1283) has been reworked.
“We changed it this year to make a deal in the Senate and we are saying that you can have an anonymous complaint if it comes with corroborating evidence,” said Rep. Tom Fabricio, R-Miami Lakes, who sponsored the bill last year in the House and is co-sponsoring it this session with Rep. Omar Blanco, R-Miami.
The bill includes other provisions favorable to law enforcement. It requires that a copy of a signed complaint be provided to a law enforcement or corrections officer under investigation by his or her department before any interrogation, and prohibits punitive action unless the accused officer has received a copy.
And it says that an individual who makes a false complaint against a law enforcement or corrections officer commits perjury, which is punishable as a third degree felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison and a $5,000 fine. If the investigation against the officer does not result in disciplinary action, the episode could not harm the officer’s ability to receive a promotion, raise, or other commendation.
Although South Florida Democratic Rep. Mike Gottlieb said he thought the change made the bill better than what was passed in the House a year ago, critics remain.
Robin Graber is deputy director of the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence. He said that right now there are guardrails in place to ensure fairness in responding to allegations of misconduct by law enforcement, but said that removing the ability to report anonymously “unjustly targets the victim’s right to autonomy, as well as longstanding practices against trauma.”
He cited an incident involving a police officer in Bay County who was arrested for sexual violence last fall. There wasn’t any corroborating evidence, Graber said. After an investigation, it was learned that geo tracking had been obtained, something the survivor had no access to.
“Survivors will have none of that information,” he said.
Rep. Dianne Hart-Lowman has visited more than 60 Florida prisons since elected to the House in 2018. She said that inmates who make complaints against correction officers are not afraid of providing their names, but the problem is that they are retaliated against.
“I don’t know what we’re going to do here in Florida as it relates to our prisons in ensuring that those body-cams are on,” she said. “That people are not taken into bathrooms. That people are not taken into areas where there are no cameras. I’ve had officers draw maps for me to show me where the blindspots are inside of these prisons where people get beat.”
Hart-Lowman was the only member of the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee to oppose the bill.
Law enforcement remains split on the proposal
One rank-and-file police officer discussed his support for the legislation.
“It  strengthens the due process protection for our law enforcement officers and corrections officers, while maintaining accountability in a fair, responsible way,” said Felix Del Rosario, a police officer with the City of Miami. 
“Right now, anonymous or unsworn complaints sometimes are driven by persons with grudges if not outright malice can launch full investigations, tie up resources, damage reputations, and create unnecessary stress for officers and their families.”
The Florida Police Benevolent Association supports the bill. The Florida Sheriffs Association and the Florida Police Chiefs Association opposes the measure. Officials with those organizations chose not to speak during the hearing.

Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, listens to reporters' questions following adjournment of the 2024 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The annual State of the Judiciary address to a joint legislative session scheduled for  Wednesday was cancelled when it became clear Senate Republicans were going to boycott. 
House Majority Leader Alex Riley, a Springfield Republican, said he found out when he came to the floor that the speech by Chief Justice W. Brent Powell would not go forward as planned. 
Senate Republicans, Riley said, were upset about recent judicial rulings, most notably a unanimous decision last week that threw out a law that included changes to who writes ballot summaries and giving the attorney general new appeal power.
“At the moment, our understanding is the Senate is a little tied up in a filibuster of sorts, and that they wouldn’t be coming over to join us,” Riley said. “So therefore there wouldn’t be a joint session. And because there’s not a joint session, there was a decision made to call it off for today, and we’ll see where things go.”
A spokeswoman for the Missouri Supreme Court could not be reached for comment.
Powell wrote the unanimous decision last week that determined the bill enacting the ballot summary law changed too much during its path through the General Assembly. The changes, Powell wrote, violated the Missouri Constitution’s requirement that amendments should not change the original purpose of legislation.
Missouri Supreme Court strikes down law on ballot title cases, special appeal power for AG

After the House adjourned for the day, Republican state Sen. Rick Brattin of Harrisonville lambasted the court’s decision in the ballot summary case and others in recent years that deemed laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional. 
He also pointed to the 2021 decision by the court upholding voter approved Medicaid expansion and a 2024 decision allowing an abortion-rights amendment to appear on the ballot. 
“It’s been quite clear that this is a problem with the judiciary thinking that they have carte blanche capability to do the job of the legislature,” Brattin said, adding: “They’re just going to do whatever the heck they want to do. They want to act like they’re the legislature.”
The bill ruled unconstitutional last week originally only contained one section intended to prevent the courts from rewriting ballot language for measures referred to voters by the General Assembly. 
By the time it was passed, it changed five sections of state law, completely revising the process for court challenges to ballot summaries and granting the attorney general authority to appeal preliminary injunctions preventing enforcement of state laws or regulations in any field.
Riley, who is in line to become speaker of the House next year, said there is “a lot of frustration within the legislature over, not just recent Supreme Court decisions, but a lot of Supreme Court decisions over the years.”
Five of the seven judges on the Supreme Court were appointed by Republican governors, including Powell. Judges are selected for the Supreme Court using a nonpartisan plan that starts with a judicial commission selecting candidates to present to the governor, who then appoints them to the bench. 
The commission is composed of three lawyers elected by the Missouri Bar, three citizens selected by the governor and the chief justice, who serves as chair. 
That process may need to change, Riley said. 
“Our current system does need some reforms,” he said. “What exactly those look like, I’m definitely open to conversations. But I do think the current system is ripe for a conversation that hasn’t happened in a long time.”
Some of the rulings that have drawn the ire of Republicans involve bills deemed unconstitutional because they contain multiple subjects or stretched beyond the original purpose of the legislation. 
Riley said that while he disagrees with many of the court’s rulings, “at the end of the day, they do have a good point that these massive omnibus bills that we’ve been doing in the legislature for a long time aren’t good for multiple reasons.”
The legality of these wide-ranging omnibus bills is certainly questionable, Riley said. 
But it’s also “a better idea to try and pass smaller, cleaner pieces of legislation over the course of the legislative process,” he said. “That can be challenging, but I do think there is some benefit to getting back to that.”

Social media posts Tuesday night from Trump threw his support behind primary challengers to Sens. Greg Goode of Terre Haute and Spencer Deery of West Lafayette.
Trump’s post endorsing Vigo County Councilwoman Brenda Wilson against Goode erroneously identified her as a county commissioner.
In a separate post, Trump endorsed Paula Copenhaver, a top aide to Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith and the Fountain County Republican chair, in her challenge to Deery.
Trump has now in recent days endorsed five challengers to incumbent Republican senators after he vowed political revenge against those who defied him on the redistricting bill that failed in December.
Those posts have used nearly identical wording, denouncing the current senators as a “RINO” — for Republican in name only — and “an America Last politician.”
Neither Goode nor Deery immediately replied Wednesday to requests for comment about Trump’s posts.
Trump’s support for their challengers also puts him at odds with two legislators with close ties to top Indiana Republican figures.
Goode is U.S. Sen. Todd Young’s state director, while Deery was a top aide to former Gov. Mitch Daniels while Daniels was the Purdue University president. 
Another of Trump’s Tuesday night posts endorsed former state Rep. Jeff Ellington for the Republican nomination for an open seat created by GOP Sen. Eric Bassler’s decision not seek reelection. Bassler, of Washington, also voted against the redistricting bill.
Trump endorsed Ellington over other Republican candidates Kristi Risk, who is a Beckwith staffer and the Owen County GOP chair, and Vincennes attorney Tanner Bouchie.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0577-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 12:59:51.102120

Esther Charlestin, the former Democratic nominee for governor of Vermont, launched a bid for the state’s second-highest office on Wednesday.
Charlestin is the third Democrat to join this year’s race for lieutenant governor. Molly Gray, who held the office from 2021 to 2023, announced her bid just after New Year’s. Ryan McLaren, a former top aide to Vermont’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, launched his campaign two weeks ago. 
All three candidates will face off in a primary election in August. Republican John Rodgers, the current lieutenant governor, has said he plans to run again, and so far no one else has indicated that they will seek the GOP nomination.
Charlestin challenged Republican Gov. Phil Scott in 2024. She was the first Black woman to win a major party nomination for Vermont governor, and only the second Black woman to ever get a major party backing for governor in the country. 
Scott defeated her overwhelmingly, winning 72% of the vote to Charlestin’s 21%. Neither of the two Democrats who challenged Scott before Charlestin garnered more than 30% of the general election vote, either.
In a campaign press release Wednesday, Charlestin highlighted her leadership on the Vermont Commission on Women, a state body she chairs that advises the Legislature and the governor’s administration on issues impacting women and girls. Charlestin also owns and manages a consulting firm.
“I’ve spent my entire career bridging the gap between communities,” she said in the release. “Far too many people are feeling unheard, unseen, and left out by our current leadership, so I’m running to give everyone a seat at the table.”
Charlestin said her campaign would focus on making sure Vermonters can access a good education, lowering the cost of living and giving people “economic freedom.”

Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, speaks from the House floor during the organizational session on Dec. 3, 2024. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s House majority leader will not seek reelection this fall after representing the Dickinson area for more than a decade in the Legislature.
Rep. Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, issued a statement Tuesday evening announcing he will retire after his term ends at the end of November.
“I’ve been in public service for almost 40 years,” Lefor said in an interview Wednesday. “My family has had to step up to the plate in the business and different events, and I didn’t want that to really continue because I need to do my share in our family businesses.”
Lefor said his family owns some rental property companies that they are looking to expand, and he wants to spend more time with his family.
“I’ve got two grandkids and I think I’m going to set a world record in pitching wiffle ball this summer,” Lefor said. 
Longtime North Dakota lawmaker, House Appropriations chair announces retirement

Politics and ideological divisions within the Republican party played no role in his decision to retire, he said. The state party convention got off to a slow start in 2024 when some members challenged the credentials of delegates from District 37, including Lefor.
“If you are there for the right reasons, and that’s creating good public policy and smart budgetary decisions, and you maintain your focus with that, the politics is just noise,” Lefor said. 
Lefor set the tone for the House as majority leader in 2023 and 2025 legislative sessions. He also chaired Legislative Management in 2023 and served as a member of the Emergency Commission. 
Prior to being elected to the Legislature, Lefor began his public service career on his local park board in 1986 at age 29. He was appointed to the Dickinson Planning and Zoning Commission in 1988, a role he kept for the next 15 years. 
House Minority Leader Rep. Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks, said Lefor maintained a “friendly and collaborative” relationship with House Democratic-NPL members.
“Leadership turnover with term limits is going to happen much more often,” he said. “Hopefully, folks can look at the example that Mike Lefor set, that Chet Pollert set before him, to have that kind of collaborative leadership, especially when we are in this reality of a super majority and a super minority.”
Republicans hold a 83-11 advantage over Democrats in the North Dakota House and a 42-5 advantage in the Senate. Odd-numbered districts, including Lefor’s, are up for reelection in 2026. 
Lefor said he tried to keep the Legislature focused on delivering the best public policy it could for North Dakotans.
“I’m grateful that the citizens of District 37, and my hometown, elected me to public office,” Lefor said. “I sincerely hope that the policies that we have enacted over the last several years are going to benefit North Dakotans for generations to come.”

DOVER, Del. — Scouts from across Delaware and the Delmarva Peninsula will gather near Dover this spring for a three-day outdoor jamboree that blends youth leadership, hands-on adventure, and American history.
The Del-Mar-Va Council of Scouting America will host its 2026 Council Jamboree, titled “A Declaration of Adventure,” from April 24–26 at Akridge Scout Reservation, located at 1910 Baden Powell Way near Dover. The event will bring together Cub Scouts, Scouts, Venturers, Sea Scouts, adult leaders, families, and community partners for a weekend of activities focused on learning, teamwork, and service.
“This jamboree is designed to be immersive, educational, and fun for every age level,” said Kevin Holcomb, event chairperson. “It gives Scouts an opportunity to take part in hands-on activities, learn about history and service, and connect with organizations that play important roles in our communities.”
Organizers said the theme ties into the nation’s upcoming 250th anniversary, with program areas highlighting Delaware, Delmarva and American history from colonial times to the present. Scouts will rotate through activity zones that emphasize leadership, civic engagement, and outdoor skills.
Planned activities include historical games and reenactments, BB gun and archery ranges, climbing and outdoor challenges, fishing, technology demonstrations, crafts, and teamwork exercises.
A wide range of educational, historical and public-safety organizations are expected to participate, including Delaware Military Academy, First State Military Academy, Delaware Technical Community College, Delaware Historical Society, Delaware Public Archives, First State Heritage Park, Kent County Historical Society, Sons and Daughters of the American Revolution, Marshall Steam Museum, Lewes Historical Society, Delaware Agricultural Museum and the 1st Delaware Regiment.
Public-safety and conservation partners will also be on site, including the Camden-Wyoming Fire Company, Dover Police Department, Delaware State Police, Kent County Department of Public Safety, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, DNREC, and Delaware Freedom First.
Scouting leaders also pointed to continued growth in the Wilmington and northern New Castle County area, where participation in Cub Scouts, Scouts, and co-ed programs has increased as families seek structured, values-based activities that build confidence and leadership skills. Local packs and troops have expanded programming centered on outdoor adventure, STEM learning, and community service, drawing youth from both urban and suburban neighborhoods. Council officials said the jamboree reflects that momentum by connecting Wilmington-area Scouts with peers from across the region while reinforcing the benefits of Scouting beyond the classroom.
“Boys and girls grow to be strong, independent, and caring people who contribute to their communities and reach their potential,” said Ray Teat, executive director and CEO of Scouting America for the Del-Mar-Va Council. “Events like this jamboree help reinforce those values while giving young people experiences they’ll remember for a lifetime.”
Scouting leaders say programs like the jamboree highlight why Scouting continues to matter for families and communities. Through hands-on learning, leadership development and service, Scouts build character, responsibility and resilience. In Delaware, Scouting also connects youth to the outdoors, local history and civic life through conservation projects, public-safety partnerships and volunteer service—helping prepare the next generation of engaged, capable community leaders.
Early registration for the jamboree is open through March 31. The event is open to the public, with free admission for youth and $20 admission for adults.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)TOPEKA — Federal public defenders who went months without pay last year are facing more financial pressure as another government shutdown looms following state-sanctioned violence in Minneapolis and across the United States.
U.S. Senate Democrats have said they will refuse to provide enough votes for a bundle of federal appropriations bills if funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement remains attached, putting defenders’ funding at risk again.
Under current proposals, the judiciary is set to receive $1.76 billion, which is a $310 million increase from the amount allocated in 2025 and 2024.
Melody Brannon, the federal public defender for Kansas, said those funds will keep the country’s 83 federal public defender offices working and pay private panel attorneys, who step in when defenders aren’t otherwise available, through the fiscal year. They also address budget shortfalls and temporary stopgap measures that left thousands of attorneys, paralegals and judicial service providers without pay for months, amounting to nearly $70 million in unpaid vouchers across the country.
“It is a significant increase from last year, but in reality we are just catching up from the full-year continuing resolution, including four-plus months of money owed to private attorneys,” she said. “We had to dig out of a deep hole caused by years of underfunding public defense.”
The 43-day government shutdown this fall exacerbated missed payments.

Federal public defenders represent roughly 60% of people charged with federal crimes. The strained funding has coincided with a three-year federal public defender hiring freeze, which is expected to be lifted if the appropriations bill passes.
U.S. Senators must vote on the appropriations bill by Friday to avoid a partial shutdown. Some have advocated for stripping the Department of Homeland Security’s appropriations from the rest of the package, allowing other funding to proceed as written. However, U.S. Senate Republicans have not indicated they will compromise. Plus, if Homeland Security funding were separated, it may require U.S. House approval, and the chamber is not scheduled to return to the Capitol until after the end of the month, making a shutdown more likely.
Immigration agents have opened fire on civilians at least 20 times since President Donald Trump deployed them in cities across the U.S. last year, according to data compiled by The Trace, a gun violence reporting outlet. Agents have killed five people in total and injured nine. Saturday, agents killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, which was the second deadly shooting in Minneapolis in recent weeks, after an agent killed 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7.
The escalation in violence fueled U.S. Senate Democrats’ efforts to thwart a Republican spending bill that contains $28 billion for ICE and Customs and Border Protection — one portion of Homeland Security’s proposed $64 billion budget, as recommended for approval by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee.
Federal public defenders from across the country in a Monday statement described the killings in Minneapolis as horrific.
“Our nonpartisan work is rooted in the foundational principles of due process and equal protection under the law,” the statement said. “These constitutional protections are universal — they extend to every person, no matter the charges they face.”
The defenders expressed concern for reports of unlawful entry into homes, excessive force, and targeting or detaining community members, including U.S. citizens, without probable cause. They called on federal immigration officials to de-escalate and cooperate with independent investigations.

Since July 2025, there have been at least 17 open-fire incidents involving federal immigration agents, according to data compiled by The Trace, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news outlet investigating gun violence.

Andrew Birrell, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and a Minneapolis resident, said in a Saturday statement the rule of law suffers when federal agents target people because of perceived resistance instead of with objective evidence of wrongdoing.
“The Bill of Rights is not a suggestion,” Birrell said. “It is the bedrock of our Republic.”
The lawyers called for a recalibration of ICE recruitment and conduct.
“Currently, the actions of these agents — such as firing at moving vehicles or gunning down individuals recording their activities — fall far short of the constitutional standards expected of any entity granted the power of the state,” he said.
Both groups of lawyers and public defenders encouraged a move away from profiling, favoring a system that prioritizes constitutional rights, respect and de-escalation.
Brannon said defenders wanted to emphasize in the statement the constitutional mandate attorneys and law enforcement are beholden to, while calling attention to federal agencies disregarding the rule of law.
“We’re not asking for anything revolutionary,” she said.
The defenders want stability and predictability in the communities they serve, Brannon said, and in Minnesota, those principles are disintegrating.
“This is just a whole new level of complexity and problems that we haven’t seen,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250603_0391-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-28 12:03:09.905554

The congresswoman faced questions about the shootings of Alex Pretti and Renée Good, saying she'd have to see a completed investigation, drawing shouts and insults.

Harriet Hageman abruptly ended a town hall session here Tuesday evening and walked off the stage to booing and shouting from her constituents while others in the audience attempted to shout down her critics.

(Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)
A series of impassioned questions regarding recent killings in Minneapolis at the hands of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officers, as well as other ICE actions, prompted an escalating back-and-forth between questioners, the congresswoman and the audience at Casper College’s Wheeler Concert Hall while a half-dozen policemen stood guard.
A tall, dark-haired young man who said he was a Casper College student quizzed her about the killings. Hageman responded, “I haven’t talked about that. I spoke about the Laken Riley Act because it was one of the bills that we passed. I haven’t talked about what was going on in Minnesota.”
“Yeah. Why is that?” the student asked. “Why haven’t you said that you condemn the violence or given condolences to the families of the victims?”

“It hasn’t been the topic that we’ve been talking about today,” Hageman answered over rising jeers from the audience. “So I think what has happened in Minnesota is a terrible tragedy for the woman and the man who were killed,” she said, referring to U.S. citizens Alex Pretti, shot dead on Saturday, and Renée Good, shot dead on Jan. 7.
The student walked out of the concert hall, shouting retorts at the congresswoman as others applauded.

(Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)
Casper resident Allyse Taylor continued the line of questioning, pressing Hageman about whether she adheres to the U.S. Constitution and whether she’s concerned about alleged ICE and Trump administration violations of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against warrantless search and seizure.
Audience members shouted references to a Department of Homeland Security internal memo that allegedly informed ICE agents they can enter homes without a judicial warrant.
“I think that I have to look at the investigation,” Hageman responded, prompting a chorus of guffaws. “If there were violations of someone’s constitutional rights, there is redress.”

“Then why is there no redress?” Taylor asked, and implored Hageman to demand transparency of investigations of the ICE killings. “They are killing American citizens in the streets, and you are doing nothing. You are not saying a single solitary thing to support constituents or to support the American people. As a constitutional lawyer, you should be infuriated. You should be incensed. Why are you not?”
Hageman then gathered her folders, waved goodbye to the audience and exited the stage through a side door while people booed and one man shouted “coward” and “chickenshit.”
Hageman touts accomplishments
Hageman, who recently announced her Senate bid to replace retiring Sen. Cynthia Lummis, began the town hall event by noting it was her first of the year, and that she intends to continue to make good on her promise to visit each of Wyoming’s 23 counties annually.
Her team allotted one hour for the town hall. Hageman spent the first 30 minutes recapping her recent accomplishments in Congress.
She voted in favor of the continuing budget resolution while helping to secure about $3 million for the Casper/Natrona County International Airport, $1 million for a Northern Arapahoe water treatment facility and more than $1.6 million for reconstruction of the Fort Laramie canal tunnel, which collapsed more than six years ago.
Hageman also touted her work to advance the Grasslands Grazing Act, sexual predator legislation and anti-abortion measures. She blamed recent winter-storm-related power outages in the eastern U.S. on Obama and Biden policies to steer electrical generation away from coal and toward renewable energy. Hageman tied the inordinate volume of truck-driver-related deaths along Interstate 80 in Wyoming to immigrants who can’t speak or read English and touted a measure to allow “18 to 20-year-old” truck drivers to legally cross state lines.

Existing laws present “a barrier,” Hageman said, adding that her congressional work will make sure “that our 18 to 20-year-olds are getting the training and can have the career — that really fabulous career — as truck drivers.”
Among the most common questions she’s asked, Hageman said, before taking questions, is “How do we keep more of our young people in the state of Wyoming?
“The key … is you have to have good jobs and you have to have housing — and housing prices across the country are astronomical.” That’s because of past policies that inhibit logging the nation’s forests, Hageman said, leaving housing developers prone to skyrocketing lumber prices from other countries.
It’s why, in the GOP-led Big Beautiful Bill, “We’re requiring the U.S. Forest Service to sell 250 million board-feet, and we’re also requiring that they enter into 20-year lease contracts with our timber companies — so that these companies can invest in what they need to, but they know that they’ll have those contracts in the long term.”
Rising housing and rental costs have outpaced incomes while new construction lags — which some blame on overly burdensome permitting, according to a recent analysis by the Wyoming Community Development Authority. The analysis also suggests that an aging population and youth out-migration are factors.
Continuation of contention?
About a dozen people were still in line to ask Hageman a question when she walked off the stage — about five minutes before the allotted time was up.
It’s not the first time Hageman has seen criticism and discord at her town hall events.
She described some audience members at a March 2025 town hall in Laramie as “hysterical” and was booed in Pinedale last year after asserting that the 2009 endangerment finding — the federal doctrine to combat air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions — was “based on false science.”
“I would prefer that people use diplomacy and be polite, because more people would have a chance to ask their questions,” Natrona County Commissioner Dave North told WyoFile after the town hall event. “There’s nothing wrong with asking questions. But being disruptive and not showing diplomacy, that’s where we run into problems.”
Taylor, who asked Hageman about constitutional violations, had a different take on the town hall event.
“I had hoped that, at least on the Second Amendment front, [Hageman] would display some sort of integrity in what she claims to stand for,” Taylor told WyoFile. “Especially in a state that is so big on gun rights.” 
After agents killed Pretti, President Donald Trump and others in his administration suggested that the 37-year-old intensive care nurse shouldn’t have brought a gun while protesting ICE. Video shows Pretti did not brandish the weapon ahead of the shooting, despite misleading statements from some in the Trump administration.
“I had hoped that maybe there would be some sort of recognition,” Taylor added, “that that really critical right for so many people here was in danger of being violated. That there was some hypocrisy in the way that these federal administration [officials] are talking about it, that she would, at the very least, recognize that. But I prepared myself to be disappointed, to be perfectly honest.”
Hageman’s next Wyoming town hall event will be from 2-3 p.m. Thursday in Thermopolis, at the Hot Springs County Museum.

Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, will visit Topeka, Wichita, Dodge City and Colby — all outside her 3rd District — to check the pulse of Kansas voters.","U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, plans to visit with voters outside her 3rd congressional district anchored by Johnson County to talk about their priorities for addressing affordability issues, including health care and jobs, (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. House YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids says she’s embarking on a four-city sweep — all locations outside her congressional district — to learn more about Kansans’ priorities for the federal government.
In an interview, the Kansas Democrat said she planned to be in the Statehouse on Thursday with Gov. Laura Kelly and Academy Award-winning filmmaker Kevin Willmott. She has scheduled a Friday tour of aerospace research facilities at Wichita State University before visiting small businesses Saturday in Dodge City and a dairy Sunday in Colby.
“I’m just looking forward to showing up, meeting people and making sure that folks’ voices continue to shape the work we’re doing,” Davids said. “I’m looking at this tour as really a chance to go a bit deeper on certain topics, connect with more communities and really listen to folks.”
In addition to opportunities for lowering consumer costs, Davis said she expected to discuss ideas for protecting jobs, strengthening health care and keeping families safe because “strong communities make a strong Kansas.”
“Groceries, health care, gas — I mean everything is so expensive right now,” she said. “There’s too many policies coming out of D.C. that are causing more chaos. It’s not that they’re not making life easier, they’re actually making life harder for some people.”
Davids represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District, which is centered on Johnson County. It also covers Anderson, Franklin and Miami counties and half of Wyandotte County.
So far, Kansas Republicans have failed to gather sufficient support in the Legislature for redrawing boundaries of the four U.S. House districts in a bid to make it difficult for Davids to win reelection in November. Redistricting has been part of a White House strategy to gerrymander Democrats out of Congress. If the tactic worked as President Donald Trump sought, it could result in the GOP retaining control of the U.S. House through the remainder of Trump’s term.
Davids opposed plans by the Legislature to change Kansas’ congressional districts ahead of 2026 elections. She has considered running for reelection to the U.S. House or campaigning for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Roger Marshall.
“I can say this tour isn’t about some kind of announcement for something different,” she said. “With the conversations around the extreme mid-decade redistricting, I’ve said this before, that no options are off the table.

Ilhan Omar follows major uptick in threats against members of Congress,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/attack-us-rep-ilhan-omar-follows-major-uptick-threats-against-members-congress,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Capitol Police investigated a drastic increase in threats against members of Congress and their staffs last year, looking into nearly 15,000 statements, behaviors and communications.The volume of investigations rose sharply from the 9,474 USCP checked during 2024, the 8,008 in 2023 and the 7,501 in 2022. USCP Chief Michael Sullivan wrote in a statement released around the time a man squirted an unknown substance on Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar during a town hall Tuesday night that the agency has been strengthening its “partnerships with law enforcement agencies across the country to keep the Members of Congress safe when they are away from Capitol Hill.”“We want to make sure agencies have the resources they need to be able to enhance protection, which is critical to the democratic process,” Sullivan added.Political violenceLast year saw several instances of political violence, including the arson at the official home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the killing of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, the shooting at the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta and the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk during a rally at Utah Valley University.Earlier Tuesday, at an appearance in Iowa, President Donald Trump singled out Omar, a Somali-American who came to the United States with family members as asylum seekers in 1995 and became a U.S. citizen in 2000. Trump, who frequently criticizes Omar, said she should not speak about the U.S. Constitution when she comes from a country that is a “disaster,” adding Somalia is known for “pirates.”USCP said in its announcement the number of partnerships with local or state law enforcement to bolster security for lawmakers when they are away from Capitol Hill tripled during the last year, rising from approximately 115 to 350 departments.“For any agency that does not have a formal agreement with us, I would encourage them to proactively reach out,” USCP Intelligence Services Bureau Director Ravi Satkalmi wrote in a statement. “The agreement provides a framework for us to reimburse partner agencies for support they provide to help secure Members of Congress.”Spending increase for lawmakers’ securityCongress approved USCP’s annual funding bill in November, increasing spending on the agency by $46 million to a total of $852 million.The legislation included $203.5 million “for the Senate and the House to enhance security measures and member protection,” according to a summary from Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash. That same package, which ended the government shutdown, provided an additional $30 million for USCP, $30 million for the U.S. Marshals Service to bolster security for members of the judicial and executive branches, and $28 million for enhanced safety for Supreme Court justices.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Wednesday morning the attack on Omar was “unfortunate” and that everyone has a responsibility to ""dial down the temperature.”“When you’re a public figure, obviously, those are some of the things that come with the job. But it’s up to our citizens in this country too, the people out there, to do their part, obviously, to make their views known and weigh in and exercise their First Amendment right. But do it in a way that’s lawful and hopefully respectful.”",,,,2026-01-28 12:03:09.905554

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Senate President Ben Albritton was released from a Gainesville hospital Tuesday night after a multi-day hospitalization for a blood clot and “potential abnormality” in his heart.
Albritton, a Wauchula Republican, returned to Tallahassee late Tuesday from Gainesville’s UF Health Shands Hospital. The “potential abnormality” that doctors in the state’s capital feared they’d seen was either gone or, as Albritton put it, “God chose to heal it.”
“Above all, I want to give glory to God, for protecting me and guiding us through this difficult time. By the grace of God and through His divine healing, I am getting better,” the Senate President said Wednesday in a  written statement. “Additionally, through the knowledge and wisdom He has given to so many medical professionals, I am fully informed and can make important decisions about my health moving forward. Praise God!”
“The future is bright!” he added.
Albritton will remain under the care of a hematologist and begin a new medication regime to prevent future blood clotting, he said. He expects to undergo multiple future appointments and screenings in the coming months.
He first began experiencing chest pains Sunday morning. That night, he went to the emergency room at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, where physicians discovered a blood clot in his lung. He was held there overnight, and doctors the following day found a “potential abnormality” in the upper left portion of his heart.
So, Albritton was taken to Gainesville’s Shands, two hours south.
Albritton plans on taking the next few days to recuperate alongside his wife, Missy.
“I have personally received over 500 text messages of well wishes and prayers from all over the state, not including emails and calls, or the hundreds of other messages received by Missy and Senate Staff in Tallahassee and back home in District 27,” he said. “Missy and I could not be more blessed in every single way.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7873-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-28 12:03:09.905554

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)The number of people waiting for the state to provide court-mandated mental health treatment has grown by 58% in the last two months, consultants said in a new report. 
The report found there were 218 people stranded in county jails waiting for mental health treatment, as of Jan. 13. In November 2025, there were 138 people on the waitlist.
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ progress to improve the state’s mental health system “is still halting,” consultants said. The independent consultants have been hired to monitor the agency as it implements reforms that are part of a consent decree to settle a class action lawsuit.
The lawsuit filed in 2023 accused the Department of Mental Health of violating the civil rights of people in the criminal justice system with severe mental illness who sometimes wait months in jails for treatment. Before their cases can resume, defendants who have been found incompetent to stand trial must receive mental health treatment so they can understand the court proceedings and help their attorneys with their defense.
There’s no sign the steadily increasing waitlist will stop growing, the consultants said in the report.
“If unchecked, this increase will soon result in a waitlist at or exceeding the number of people on the waitlist when the [consent decree] was entered,” consultants wrote.
The department was unable to provide an official statement in time for this story, citing reduced staffing due to winter weather.
The state agreed to make fixes to the competency restoration system last year in March. At the time, at least 250 people were believed to be on the department’s waitlist, but consultants said that the data they received from the agency was “so flawed and internally contradictory,” it was not possible to establish a precise count.
Nearly a year later, consultants still had questions about the validity of data the department is reporting, and called for a full-time external auditor to verify the figures.
The latest report, and the slew of deadlines and requirements it creates for the department, is the result of a mediated session with the attorneys who filed the lawsuit on behalf of people in county jails waiting for treatment. Paul DeMuro, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, had previously asked the court to sanction the Department of Mental Health for its lack of progress.
DeMuro’s request was denied by a judge, but penalties have already begun for failing to come into compliance with agreed-upon fixes. Since November, the department has been fined more than $3.1 million for failing to reduce wait times for treatment and make other improvements.
DeMuro said in a statement that he agreed with the consultants’ latest findings, and admonished the department for its slow progress.
“After seven months of missed deadlines and rising wait times, the Department has still not implemented the Plan it agreed to,” DeMuro said. “People with serious mental illness are sitting in jail far longer than the law allows. This puts incredible strain on every aspect of Oklahoma’s criminal justice system. The court-appointed Consultants have given the State a clear roadmap. It’s time to act before this crisis overwhelms our jails and our justice system.”
Missed deadlines as agency deals with financial turmoil 
The most significant violation the consultants identified was the department’s failure to create a mandated “plan” to speed up wait times and improve the state’s competency restoration system. The consent decree required the plan be submitted in June, but consultants said it “neither exists nor has it been implemented.”
The consent decree also tasks the Department of Mental Health with creating two pilot programs to treat people at jails instead of waiting for a bed at the state mental hospital in Vinita.
The consultants reported they have received no documented effort at developing and implementing the pilot programs in Tulsa or another county. The initial deadline was also in June. The Tulsa County jail pod originally made available for the pilot program is no longer available because of the need to hold ICE detainees, the department told consultants.
Court consultants reported multiple requests for information from the department have been ignored, including questions about waitlist criteria, accreditation reports and other key data.
“[The Department of Mental Health’s] response to requests has substantially improved since entry of the Decree, after change of executive leadership at the agency. However, there are still occasions when requests for information receive no response,” consultants wrote.
The Department of Mental Health has been strained by a budget crisis and a change of leadership over the past year. The agency ran out of money to pay its 2,000 state employees last May and had to get an emergency infusion of cash from the Legislature.
Interim Commissioner Greg Slavonic has been in charge of the department since June, after state lawmakers fired former Commissioner Allie Friesen. During his time as the head of the department, Slavonic has made significant cost-cutting measures to “right the ship,” including slashing contracts for mental health providers. Slavonic has repeatedly identified coming into compliance with the consent decree as one of his key priorities.
Consultants acknowledged some improvement since Slavonic’s hire, but said the department is still not meeting “best efforts” to improve wait times for people waiting in jails across the state.
Slavonic could soon leave his temporary post, underscoring the need for a “solid plan,” the report said.
Along with an increased number of people waiting for treatment, admissions to the state’s lone state mental hospital have “sharply decreased,” the consultants said.
The facility, the Oklahoma Forensic Center, is in the process of adding a new wing with 80 new beds. In October, the department hosted a job fair seeking 100 new hires. A spokesperson for the department reported that more than 25 job offers had been extended.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office called on the Department of Mental Health to work toward reforms after the consultants issued their report.
“We appreciate the prompt and thoughtful work of the consultants and we hope this gives the department the additional insight it needs to comply with the consent decree and begin to provide prompt and meaningful mental health restoration services to people needing those services before their criminal charges can be pursued and appropriately resolved,” the Attorney General’s office said in a statement.
The consent decree required the agency to reduce wait times for treatment to 45 days by Jan 10. As of Jan. 13, the median wait time was 77 days.

Events in Bismarck, Fargo, and Minot are planned to educate voters on three measures, all placed on the ballot by the state Legislature, that could change the state’s initiative process for changing the state constitution and term limit laws for legislators.
The events will cover: 
Single-subject rule: Measure 1 on the June 2026 ballot would restrict the scope of constitutional initiatives to a single subject. Voters defeated a similar proposal known as Measure 2 in 2024.
Term limits changes: Measure 1 on the November ballot would alter the constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2022 that limits how many terms legislators may serve. It also is the subject of a lawsuit. 
60% rule: Measure 2 on the November ballot would require that at least 60% voter approval is needed to enact constitutional amendments. 
The first event will be at 6:30 p.m. Thursday in the basement of the Bismarck Veterans Memorial Public Library hosted by the North Dakota Watchdog Network.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has been criticized for his silence on the killing of two Minnesota residents at the hands of federal law enforcement agents this month, says he’s reserving judgment on the shooting of Alex Pretti by U.S. Border Patrol agents on Saturday, pending a full investigation.
“As a career law enforcement officer, I know better than to draw conclusions related to law enforcement action without having all the facts at my disposal, and I encourage all Americans to the same,” Lombardo, a former Clark County sheriff, said in a statement early Wednesday.  
The admonition is in stark contrast to the rush to judgment exhibited by top officials in President Donald Trump’s administration, including: Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem, who asserted Pretti “was brandishing” a gun at federal agents; FBI Director Kash Patel, who asserted Pretti “attacked” agents; and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who referred to Pretti as “an assassin” — a claim that was reposted on social media by Vice president JD Vance. All those claims are discredited by multiple videos of the incident.
Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino said it “looks like” Pretti “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” a claim echoed by Homeland Security via social media.  
Lombardo said protecting the right to peaceably assembly is “a top priority for officials at every level of government,” adding “there is nothing more fundamental in our Republic than exercising or rights granted to us under the First Amendment – without fear of retribution.” 
In 2020, Metro, under Lombardo’s watch, was widely criticized for its tactics, including the killing of a protester, during Black Lives Matter protests.
The governor did not address Trump’s assertion Tuesday that “you can’t have guns” at protests. Patel also alleged Pretti violated the law by carrying a concealed weapon at a protest, an exception not present in the Second Amendment. 
Patel and Trump voiced no similar objections when 17 year-old Kyle Rittenhouse shot three men, two fatally, during a 2020 protest in Wisconsin. Trump later invited Rittenhouse, who was acquitted at trial, to the White House. 
Lombardo said he was pleased that Trump called for a “thorough and unbiased review” of the evidence and said he believes anyone found culpable “regardless of the circumstances surrounding their involvement,” will be prosecuted. 
The governor reiterated his support for Trump’s border security efforts, adding he believes “we should remove violent or repeat criminals from our streets and neighborhoods as swiftly and as safely as we can.” He implored federal law enforcement to work with state and local governments “consistently and transparently to ensure the safety of our communities and keep every American citizen free from harm.” 
Though Lombardo did not mention the killing of Renee Good at the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month, he said he and his wife, Donna, are “distressed by the events of the past few weeks in Minnesota,” and hope to “reduce the tension that is seemingly gripping our country by simply listening more to people who hold different viewpoints.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260124_0729-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 11:05:45.019380

By George Rotsch, Editor Delaware LIVE
WILMINGTON, Del. — As Delaware’s energy future took center stage in Gov. Matt Meyer’s recent State of the State address, the discussion highlighted a growing challenge facing the First State: how to balance ambitious clean-energy goals with the rapidly rising electricity demands of a technology-driven economy.
In his address, Meyer identified offshore wind development as Delaware’s top long-term energy priority, while also referencing the state’s participation in studies examining small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) as a potential future power source. The remarks came as regulators, utilities, and local officials are reviewing whether Delaware’s electric grid can support a proposed large-scale data center in New Castle County — one of the most energy-intensive projects ever considered in the state.
That debate mirrors challenges seen elsewhere, including in California, where power availability, regulatory timelines, and rising infrastructure costs reshaped major technology investments, including a planned Microsoft data-center project that was ultimately abandoned.
What Happened in California
Microsoft’s California project was part of a broader effort to expand cloud-computing and artificial-intelligence infrastructure during a rapid buildout in 2023 and 2024. By mid-2025, industry analysts reported that Microsoft had pulled back from several planned data-center projects in the United States and Europe, totaling roughly 2 gigawatts of planned capacity.
Analysts said the decision reflected a reassessment of demand and a shift toward upgrading existing facilities rather than building new ones. Environmental review timelines, uncertainty around electric-grid capacity and escalating costs were among the factors cited in industry reports.
In California, large data centers are subject to extensive environmental studies examining air quality, water use, noise and land use. Those reviews can take years and are often vulnerable to legal challenges. Facilities also require large numbers of backup diesel generators, which must meet strict emissions standards.
Power availability proved to be an even larger hurdle. Modern AI-focused data centers can require hundreds of megawatts of electricity, comparable to the demand of a small city. Utilities warned that delivering that power would require major upgrades to transmission lines and substations, projects that can take five to 10 years to complete.
As timelines stretched and costs climbed, Microsoft chose not to wait and redirected investment to regions where power and permits could be secured more quickly.
A Similar Debate Emerges in Delaware
Delaware is now confronting a parallel set of questions as a proposed data-center campus in New Castle County called “Project Washington” advances through regulatory and local review.
According to filings by Delmarva Power, multiple proposed data centers in the county could require up to 2 gigawatts of electricity if fully built out, an amount approaching the state’s total peak demand. Utility officials have said meeting that demand would require significant infrastructure upgrades.
In response, the Delaware Public Service Commission opened a docket in late 2025 to examine how large electricity users should be connected to the grid and how upgrade costs should be allocated. Regulators have said the goal is to ensure that residential and small-business customers are not left paying for infrastructure built primarily to serve a single large customer.
Environmental permits related to stormwater, air quality and land use are also under review by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, while New Castle County Council continues to evaluate zoning and planning issues tied to the proposal.
Energy Reliability and Cost at the Center of the Debate
Energy analysts say reliability has become a central issue as Delaware seeks to attract power-intensive industries — including data centers, hydrogen projects, and advanced manufacturing — that require electricity around the clock.
“If Delaware wants to compete for data centers, hydrogen facilities, and advanced manufacturing, our energy policy has to go beyond wind,” said Dave Stevenson, a former DuPont engineer and energy policy expert.
“Those industries require reliable, around-the-clock power, and intermittent sources like offshore wind can’t deliver that on their own,” Stevenson said. “Other states are planning for firm generation and grid capacity, and Delaware will have to do the same to attract and keep major employers.”
At the same time, several state lawmakers and advocacy groups have warned that the proposed data center’s electricity demand — estimated at up to 1.2 gigawatts — could strain the grid and increase costs for Delaware residents if new generation is not added.
The most vocal concerns have come from State Sen. Stephanie Hansen, a Democrat from Middletown and chair of the Energy Stakeholders Group, which includes utility executives, consumer advocates and environmental representatives.
“The effect of the data center’s draw of energy from the grid without new energy being brought into the grid from somewhere else is going to have a tremendous impact on our Delaware energy bills,” Hansen said during public discussions of the project.
Members of the Energy Stakeholders Group have echoed those concerns, warning that the project’s electricity demand is unprecedented in Delaware and could require major transmission and substation upgrades. They have questioned whether the regional grid operator, PJM Interconnection, can supply that level of power without significant infrastructure investment — and whether those costs could ultimately be passed on to ratepayers.
Similar concerns have been raised by residents during public hearings held by New Castle County Council and state agencies, where speakers cited fears of higher electric bills, reliability risks during peak demand and the cost of expanding energy infrastructure to support a single industrial user.
While the county has not rejected the proposal outright, council members have advanced an ordinance to regulate data centers, including provisions related to energy use, noise and backup power systems. Councilman Dave Carter has cited the “enormous energy use requirements” of hyperscale data centers as a key concern.
Why Data Centers Matter to Delaware
Despite the challenges, state economic development officials, technology experts and the developer argue that data centers can play an important role in Delaware’s economy.  “Data centers are an important part of the broader technology ecosystem. When developed thoughtfully, they can create high-quality jobs, spur infrastructure investment, and help diversify Delaware’s economy,” said Zakiyyah Ali, executive director of the Tech Council of Delaware. “At the same time, we recognize that these projects can raise important questions about environmental impact, energy use, and community priorities.”
Data centers represent large private investments, often costing tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to build. Construction typically creates hundreds of short-term jobs, while ongoing operations require skilled technicians, engineers, and security staff. The developers behind Project Washington, a proposed large data center near Delaware City, promote it as a major economic boon, estimating nearly $10 billion in economic output during construction, millions in annual tax revenue for schools and local government, and hundreds of high-paying jobs.
New Castle County and the schools can benefit from property-tax revenue tied to the value of buildings and specialized equipment, without the added strain on schools and services that often comes with residential development.
Data centers also support industries already central to Delaware’s economy, including banking, health care, logistics, and corporate services, all of which rely on secure and reliable digital infrastructure. Delaware’s East Coast location, access to major fiber-optic networks, and proximity to large population centers are often cited as competitive advantages.
Economic Developers Cite Competitiveness
The Delaware Prosperity Partnership (DPP), the state’s lead economic development organization, has publicly described Delaware as a strong candidate for data-center investment.
“Data centers are one of the hottest project trends across the U.S. right now,” DPP spokesperson Susan Colby said in July 2025 after Starwood Digital Ventures filed plans for a large data-center campus in New Castle County. “Given Delaware’s tax structure and its other favorable features, our state would be a highly competitive location for almost any company looking to establish a data center.”
DPP has not taken a public position on the project’s power demand, electric-rate impacts, or environmental concerns, noting that those issues fall under the authority of regulators and local governments.
What Comes Next
No final decision has been made on the New Castle County data-center proposal. Regulatory proceedings, environmental reviews and public hearings are expected to continue in the coming months.
How Delaware resolves questions about power supply, cost allocation, and oversight will help determine whether the state can capture the economic benefits outlined by development officials — or whether the project encounters the same delays and uncertainties that reshaped major data-center investments in California.

Boley, 90, was the longest continuously serving state senator in West Virginia history. She announced her resignation Jan. 8, citing a need to focus more on her family and health.
Barnhart, a banker from St. Marys, was first appointed to the House of Delegates by former Gov. Jim Justice in 2019. Barnhant was elected in 2020 and reelected in 2022 and 2024. He’s a graduate of the University of Charleston. 
“Delegate Barnhart has served West Virginians in the 7th District with energy, integrity and a deep commitment to conservative principles,” Morrisey said in a news release Tuesday night. “I am honored to appoint him to the West Virginia Senate to succeed Senator Donna Boley, whose decades of service have shaped our state for the better.” 
The governor has also appointed former Del. Guy Ward to the vacant seat representing the 74th district of the House of Delegates. Del. Mike DeVault, R-Marion, resigned from the House seat just before the start of the legislative session earlier this month. 
Ward was elected to the House of Delegates in 2016 and 2020, according to a biography on his campaign website. He lost to DeVault in the 2022 Republican primary election for the 74th district seat, according to the West Virginia Secretary of State’s website. He also served as councilman and mayor for the town of White Hall and served on the Marion County Commission. 
According to the governor’s office, Ward “built a strong record of advocating for conservative values and practical solutions for West Virginia families.” He’s a supporter of the Second Amendment, a strong advocate for pro-life policies, and a champion for small businesses across the state, according to Morrisey.

For the past several years, […]","Chuck Jones, left, and Michael Dowling, right. (Photos by WEWS.)The trial against two former FirstEnergy executives who are accused of masterminding the largest public corruption scheme in Ohio history has begun, as jury selection took place Tuesday in Summit County.
“There are so many different fees, and I don’t even know what they’re for,” FirstEnergy customer John Makley said.
For the past several years, when Makley looked at his utility bill, he blamed the state.
“I’m disappointed that because of those indiscretions they threw at us, and the lawmakers have voted for it, it caused our prices to go up,” Makley said. “I’m hoping that the trials will certainly make up for that.”
Former FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones and VP Michael Dowling allegedly paid former Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Chair Sam Randazzo $4.3 million in bribes, along with $61 million spent to create and pass Ohio House Bill 6.
H.B. 6 was legislation to provide a billion-dollar bailout for their struggling company.
And with that bribe, the costs were pushed onto ratepayers like Makley.
“It’s disheartening,” Makley said. “I’m annoyed that I have to pay more money out of pocket.”
Jones and Dowling face nearly a dozen state charges each, ranging from bribery to corrupt activity. In January of 2025, a federal grand jury indicted them for racketeering.
In March of 2023, a jury found that Householder and former GOP leader Matt Borges, beyond a reasonable doubt, participated in the racketeering scheme that left four men guilty and one dead.
Neil Clark, a lobbyist accused of bribery, died by suicide after pleading not guilty in 2021.
Householder is now sitting in prison, while Borges is out after serving half of his five-year sentence.
In February of 2024, Jones, Dowling, and Randazzo were all hit with state charges. Each pleaded not guilty during their joint arraignment.
In April of 2024, Randazzo would become the second defendant accused in the scandal to die by suicide.
Case Western Reserve University criminal law professor Michael Benza explained that Jones and Dowling will likely use the same defense strategy as Householder.
“This line between legitimate political activity, campaign contributions, those types of things, and when it crosses that line into bribery — that line is very, very fuzzy,” Benza said.
The defense will argue that this was politics as usual; people make donations to candidates and politicians who share interests.
“‘It was all maybe unsavory, it may be unseemly, it may be something we don’t like about politics, but it is the rules, we played by the rules,'” Benza said, imitating what he thought the defense would say. “‘You have to acquit us.'”
FirstEnergy, as a company, has already admitted to bribing public officials, including the $4.3 million bribe to Randazzo.
Makley hopes that the men take responsibility.
“I want somebody to say, ‘Yeah, I screwed up, we owe you money,’ but I don’t know if I’m ever gonna hear that from any of those officials.”
Opening statements are set to happen in the coming days, but the trial is expected to last eight weeks.
What happened to H.B. 6?
There were several portions to H.B. 6.
The nuclear bailout portion was repealed in 2021.
However, up until mid-2025, ratepayers had still been paying a subsidy that funded two Ohio Valley Electric Corporation coal plants — one in Southern Ohio and one in Indiana.
The main beneficiaries for OVEC were American Electric Power Company (AEP), Duke Energy and AES Ohio.
Still, FirstEnergy collected payment for it.
In 2025, lawmakers finally repealed the remaining financial aspects of the legislation.
Following this, utility companies tried to hike their prices.
And it seems that the PUCO is still managing to keep secrets, according to testimony that alleges the state’s utility regulating body is trying to go easy on and help energy companies.
At the end of June 2025, a legal transcript from the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel cross-examined an auditor who admitted that PUCO staff asked him to delete information and recommendations that would have helped protect consumers.
The OCC said that PUCO, under Randazzo, was encouraging auditors to go easy on utility companies and to let them review drafts of the audits before publishing.
Who else is involved?
Major political players have been linked to the scandal. Both Gov. Mike DeWine and Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, whom we investigated for their close relationships with FirstEnergy, are listed as witnesses for the defense.
Neither have been accused by law enforcement of any wrongdoing.
Former lawmaker Bill Seitz is also listed as a witness for the defense.
His advocacy helped prevent H.B. 6 from fully being repealed.
Once he termed out of the legislature in 2025, the new GOP leadership got rid of it.
Juan Cespedes and Jeff Longstreth, the two men originally indicted with Householder, flipped. They took plea agreements early on, helping the FBI, and are still awaiting their sentencing. The feds are asking for 0-6 months for them.
Scripps News colleagues at WPTV in West Palm Beach reached out to me to confirm the identity of Cespedes, as he is now living in Florida and is opening a bar with musician Diplo.
In December of 2025, we asked Attorney General Dave Yost if he was aware that Cespedes was in Florida and in the restaurant industry.
“I have not,” Yost responded. “I think it’s curious that he and Mr. Longstreth are still pending sentencing, but you’ll have to talk to the US Attorney for that.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A 5-year-old boy, wearing a Spiderman backpack and a bright blue winter hat, detained by immigration enforcement agents after returning home with his dad after preschool. A chaotic scene outside a high school around dismissal time; immigration enforcement agents spraying chemical irritants and tackling people.
The Trump administration’s siege against Minneapolis has played out not just in public streets but in schools — places once considered “sensitive locations” off limits to immigration enforcement activities — and with children. It has many Nevadans wondering whether Clark County School District, the fifth largest school district in the country, is doing — or can do — anything to protect its students and their families if similar surges happen here.
The Nevada Department of Education says it “is not aware of any instances during the current or preceding school year in which federal immigration authorities have attempted to access Nevada school grounds without a lawful order, warrant, or applicable exception.” The department clarified to the Nevada Current that it is also unaware of any enforcement actions on school grounds that were deemed allowable.
The Nevada Immigration Coalition and the ACLU of Nevada say they are similarly unaware of any such activity on school grounds.
“What we have been hearing from the community is people have been picked up while they’re taking children to school or picking them up from school,” said Noé Orosco, coordinator of the Nevada Immigration Coalition, which is led by Progressive  Leadership Alliance of Nevada (PLAN), Culinary Union and Make the Road Nevada and includes 20 statewide partners.
CCSD, in a statement to the Current, said it “cannot verify off-campus law enforcement activity.” The Nevada DOE said it could not speak to whether or how individual schools were tracking or reporting off-campus activities.
Orosco believes the district’s responsibility “does not begin and end at the school gates.” 
“CCSD operates beyond the physical boundaries of a campus,” he says. “They have programs in community settings, they have a police department that monitors adjacent streets to campus. I don’t think the district should be narrowing its scope and saying it can only do something within the boundaries of any school.”
ACLU of Nevada executive director Athar Hassebullah said what happens outside of official school grounds is a “free for all.” Federal immigration agents are able to engage in those spaces, and because of a recent precedent set by the U.S. Supreme Court, they are increasingly profiling people based on perceived race or accent.
The prospect of immigration agents camping out near a school — either looking for specific individuals, or even just using their presence to incite fear — is a real threat, said Hassebullah. Making matters worse are growing reports of AI-generated images and videos of ICE agents outside of schools.
“This could cause additional panic,” he added.
Reports, whether intended to protect or to panic, are now common on local social media groups.
Data privacy concerns are also a growing concern, adds Hassebullah, though they are not as widely discussed because they don’t involve dark tinted SUVs driven by masked men with tactical gear. The ACLU of Nevada has sued the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles, alleging the agency improperly and illegally turned over driver information to ICE.
All of this contributes to “a very real fear” among students and their families, advocates agree. Nevada has one of the highest shares of school-aged children in immigrant families, behind only California, Texas and New Jersey, according to American Community Survey data analyzed by KFF.
Mixed-status families, of which Nevada has many, may be rethinking their schedules to ensure that someone less likely to be targeted by immigration officials is picking up the children.
“These conversations are being had,” says Orosco, though he emphasized that such conversations aren’t limited to school bell schedules because immigration enforcement is currently happening in a variety of spaces, often without an audience of observers.
On the whole, Orosco feels the conversation is shifting, from “immigration enforcement in Nevada is not at the same level as Minneapolis” to “Nevada is not seeing the same level of enforcement yet.”
“Yet.” he emphasized. “The key thing is it is not happening yet.”
He continued, “The federal government has essentially shown it has no limitations. How can we prepare? Nevada could be a targeted location.”
During a special session in November, state lawmakers passed legislation to prohibit federal immigration officers from accessing school grounds without a warrant. Those provisions were amended into Gov. Joe Lombardo’s sweeping crime bill after separate, stronger protections being pushed by the Latino caucus were rejected by majority party leaders.
Lawmakers also passed a data privacy bill designed to better protect student data beyond FERPA.
But they should have done much more, says Hassebullah. The ACLU pushed for legislation to bar the expansion of ICE detention centers in the states. That “would have helped all people, including students and their families,” he added.
They also could have considered legislation to ensure that local police officers are on the side of Nevadans and not, as Hassebullah sees them, the “untrained thugs” on immigration enforcement teams who routinely harass and threaten citizens and immigrants alike.
Law enforcement should be required under state law “to immediately treat every single incident that comes through, in every single jurisdiction in Nevada, as an emergency,” says Hassebullah. “They should respond immediately and protect the individual that’s being accosted in that fashion.”
Adds Hassebullah, “There’s a whole lot more that could be done. We could also have a governor that steps up and says something about the issue as a whole.”
Lombardo did not respond to requests for comment about events in Minneapolis earlier this week. Early Wednesday morning, he issued a statement reiterating his support for “the President’s efforts to secure the border,” but also disapproving of Trump administration officials who decided “to draw conclusions related to law enforcement action without having all the facts.”
A hotline and ‘engaging’
In the absence of action from political leaders, community groups are stepping up.
Last year, during one of what they said were two immigration enforcement surges in the state, the coalition launched a hotline where people could report suspected ICE activity, which people would then try to verify and spread awareness about. The hotline also provides people with resources.
According to Orosco, the coalition around two weeks ago verified a parent had been picked up by immigration enforcement agents after dropping a student off at an eastside high school. But the incident did not occur on the campus itself.
Orosco said the coalition is “engaging” with CCSD Superintendent Jhone Ebert’s office and hopes it can sit down soon to collaborate. Members are hoping to discuss how and what resources the district is making available to students and their families.
Those efforts began before scores of students participated in anti-ICE walkouts. But Orosco thinks the walkouts have made it all the more important for which discussions to happen.
The students “are asking for leadership from the district that does not disappear when it becomes uncomfortable or politically difficult,” he said.
Orosco believes many of the students who participated in the walkout did so because the issue is highly personal.
“Many of them go to school carrying a question that they should not have to carry,” he said. “‘Will my family still be together when I get home?’ That fear doesn’t disappear when the bell rings. It will shape how they learn, whether they’re able to learn.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260122_0116-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-28 11:05:45.019380

Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon, describes his bill to legalize video lottery during a hearing Tuesday, of the Missouri House Emerging Issues Committee (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Video lottery operators on Tuesday promised Missouri will reap a windfall of money for education and other programs if lawmakers will substitute their devices for slot machine-like games currently in thousands of retail locations across the state.
But opponents of a bill, which was debated by the House Emerging Issues, said legalizing video gambling in convenience stores, bars and fraternal halls would drain money from poor communities and create other problems that would outweigh any benefits.
For nearly a decade, what vendors call “no chance gaming” has survived massive enforcement efforts by the Missouri State Highway Patrol and local governments by filing lawsuits and stretching out criminal prosecutions. Part of that effort has been massive political contributions that at one point forced then-Attorney General Andrew Bailey to withdraw from defending the highway patrol in a lawsuit challenging its enforcement efforts.
Tolerance of the machines is growing thin in some communities. Springfield successfully defended an ordinance banning the machines, and Kansas City has followed suit with an ordinance banning them as a public nuisance and health hazard.
“For years, we were patient and we waited, but we’ve had enough,” Shannon Cooper, a lobbyist for Kansas City, said in testimony to the committee Tuesday night.

Under the latest plan to legalize video lottery terminals, state Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon, wants to put the Missouri Lottery in charge of the games, require licenses for all retailers and vendors, and tax the profits after prizes at 34%.
Of that tax, 31% is for state education programs, split between public schools and higher education and 3% is for local governments. The official estimate is that the taxes could generate $291 million for education programs within two years, with licensing and other fees generating $55 million more for veterans programs.
Smaller amounts would be set aside to provide pensions for elected county prosecutors and support a new enforcement bureau in the attorney general’s office.
The question before lawmakers, Hardwick told the committee, is not whether there will be gambling in retail locations, but whether it will be regulated and taxed.
“There’s gaming all over the state right now, various types of games,” Hardwick said. “There’s what you call the gray machines, and no chance machines. There’s also just illegal slot machines operating. In the state of Missouri, this gaming is happening throughout the state with no rules regulations.”
Opponents of the bill argued that enforcement of current law, and perhaps a stronger law banning the games, would solve the problem.
“The General Assembly should not reward illegal activity by acting to make that activity legal after the offender has continually exploited the market,” said Ray McCarty, executive director of the Associated Industries of Missouri.

 ‘Gray market’

The games available in most convenience stores and other retail locations are called “no chance games” because they have a function that allows a gambler to know the outcome of the next play before making a bet.
They have come to be called “gray market” machines because the vendors argue that feature means they do not violate Missouri anti-gambling laws.
The argument has started to crumble. In October, a federal jury ordered Wildwood-based Torch Electronics, the biggest vendor of the games in the state, to pay $500,000 to a competitor that provides traditional arcade games for unfairly forcing them out of 20 locations.
The jury found that the Torch games fit the state’s definition of an illegal gambling device.
And Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, who replaced Bailey after he was appointed to a top FBI job, told Missourinet that she intends to crack down on the machines.
Platte County Prosecutor Eric Zahnd scored the only felony conviction of a “gray market” game vendor in 2020. On Tuesday night, he testified in favor of Hardwick’s bill because no other prosecutor has followed up on that success.
“The law today, sadly, just doesn’t work,” Zahnd said.
 Constitutional questions

The Missouri Constitution, since 1875, has barred lawmakers from enacting laws to “authorize lotteries or gift enterprises for any purpose.” Voters have approved exceptions for charitable bingo games, the Missouri Lottery and casino gambling along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers.
In testimony Tuesday, committee members were told by one attorney that by giving responsibility for the games to the Missouri Lottery, the bill would fit in the constitutional exceptions.
“This is a constitutional bill, period,” said Scott Pool, a lawyer from Jefferson City.
The key element of an unconstitutional game is that there is no element of skill needed to play and nothing the player can do will enhance their chances of winning. When Missourians first approved casino gambling by statute, courts ruled games like poker or craps were games of skill, and therefore legal, while slot machines violated the lottery ban.
Only a second vote, on a constitutional amendment providing an exception, allowed the casinos to offer slot machine games.
The constitution also earmarks all tax proceeds from gambling to education programs. Casinos generated $363 million for education programs in fiscal 2025 and the lottery provided $337 million.
No revenue figures are yet available for sports wagering, launched late last year after voters approved a 2024 constitutional amendment.
Attorney Marc Ellinger, speaking for casino lobbying group the Missouri Gaming Association, said Hardwick’s bill violates the ban on laws authorizing games of chance. And, he added, it unconstitutionally diverts money from education by adding a tax for local needs. 
“It cannot survive under the precedent of the Missouri Supreme Court, under the express words of the constitution,” he said.
 How it would work

Hardwick’s bill would impose requirements similar to those on casino slot machines and lottery retailers who sell physical lottery tickets.
Like casino slot machines, the games would have to return at least 80% of the money bet as prizes. Casino profits are taxed at 21%.
Records produced at the federal trial showed Torch games returned about 65% of money wagered as prizes. That money is taxed as ordinary income.
Retailers would be given a year to transition from the gray market games to machines licensed by the Missouri Lottery. The machines currently in place would be removed, in part because only machines connected to the lottery’s computer system to monitor play would be legal after the year expired.
The current machines do not have that capability.
No retailer who currently has gray market machines would be excluded from being licensed as a video lottery retailer.
“That allows us to get rid of the gray machines, replace it with the licensed program, and we can still have a non-interruption in business,” Hardwick said.
He said he would be open to changes but he wants to protect the revenue of retailers who have come to depend on the money generated by the machines.
“I want your views about what you think is fair and not fair, from the small business owners point of view, from the point of view of businesses who have not participated in the gray market, from the point of view of our schools, of our police, of our veterans,” Hardwick said. “I want it to be something that’s a fair and just bill, and I know that it’s a really complicated bill.”
The bill would require retailers to put all the games in a designated location on their premises, divided from other business operations, with video surveillance and monitoring to make sure no one under 21 plays.
In past years, the legislation required that area to be enclosed and off-limits to non-players. 
Two “no-chance” gambling machines await customers in a Columbia convenience store (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
The loosening of those restrictions raised questions among committee members. State Rep. Josh Hurlbert, a Republican from Smithville, described what he saw when he was taking his young children to Poplar Bluff for the eclipse last year.
During a restroom stop, he said he saw a child sitting in front of one of the games.
“That kid wasn’t playing,” Hurlbert said. “He was sitting at it, watching. But that is probably something we don’t want to encourage, either.”
He made an excuse about needing to keep on the road rather than explain the machines were gambling devices when one child asked to play, he said.
An entirely separate room could be financially impossible for small retailers, Hardwick said.
“If a small business has to have a separate space, and an inability to get a construction project funded, they are disadvantaged.” Hardwick said. “So I’d like to come up with wording that doesn’t necessarily disadvantage them, that gets after the social problem.”
Communities that don’t want video lottery could, under the bill, pass ordinances prohibiting the games or banning cash prizes, said Troy Stremming, a lobbyist for J&J Ventures, an Illinois company that is a video lottery vendor.
“They could use the two provisions together, like a shield and a sword,” he said. “If they choose, by passing an ordinance, they can shield their community from lottery issuing any VLT licenses in their local jurisdiction and you’re also giving them a sword to go after the illegal operators.”
The new voices in the years-long debate over the games are state business lobbies, who see the games as a drain on the financial stability of families and employees.
Lawmakers should resist any legislation except bills to ban the games, said Jared Hankinson, vice president of government affairs for the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
“It creates unequal regulation within the same industry,” Hankinson said. “It retroactively legitimizes unlawful operators, and it expands high risk gambling and for vulnerable communities without safeguards.”
And, he said, the bill sends the wrong message to lawbreakers.
“This is a signal from the General Assembly that compliance with laws is optional,” Hankinson said, “and that if you operate long enough, outside of the law, eventually the legislature may change the law to accommodate you.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hardwick-gaming-20260127-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-28 11:05:45.019380

(File photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)Some bad ideas are perennial.
Take, for instance, the misguided notion of closing South Carolina’s free and open primary elections.
Closed-primary proposals show up at the Statehouse as regularly as Palmetto bugs tumbling from the trees every spring.
It’s not a pleasant sight.
Closed primaries generally require voters to register with a specific party to vote in that party’s primary.
But primary elections are funded by all taxpayers. They should remain free and open to all voters — not just to those who register with a party.
In addition, many South Carolina political races are decided in the primary elections.
Closing the primaries would disenfranchise unaffiliated voters from participating in the most decisive stage of voting.
That, of course, is one of the effects of closed primaries: limiting the participation of independent-minded voters at a time when they constitute the fastest-growing segment of the electorate.
With roughly 45% of Americans identifying as independent — a historic high — unaffiliated voters now outnumber the major parties.
Independent voters pay taxes to support the primaries and should not be shut out.
South Carolinians have enjoyed open primaries for generations, and voters have shown little interest in having that freedom taken away.
The good news: Although two current proposals to close South Carolina’s primaries have gotten a lot of notice, they appear to be failing due to a pitched “civil war” within the Republican Party, according to reporting by the S.C. Daily Gazette’s Adrian Ashford and Seanna Adcox.
The issue appears to be dead for now, but it’s likely to rear its ugly head in the future.
Political polarization
For at least two decades, fierce partisans in South Carolina have pushed to close the primaries in the name of party discipline and loyalty — at the expense of sidelining independent-minded voters.
They would shrink Ronald Reagan’s vision of a “big-tent” party — an inclusive space that can accommodate diverse viewpoints — into something far narrower.
With fewer independent voters participating in primaries, party leaders can more easily ensure that candidates toe a rigid partisan line.
Closed systems tend to produce lower turnout and an electorate less representative of the broader public, yielding nominees chosen by a narrow slice of highly ideological voters rather than a wide cross-section of citizens.
When only party loyalists vote in primaries, candidates are rewarded for appealing to the ideological extremes of their base rather than to moderate or independent voters.
The predictable result is greater political polarization — exactly what South Carolina does not need.
Hyper-partisanship encourages performative politics, policy distractions and extremism.
It’s how we end up with state lawmakers wasting time and money on anti-vax crusades, chemtrail conspiracies, defunding the police, and abortion bills that could subject women to the death penalty.
What South Carolina needs instead are more independent voters willing to question orthodoxy and temper partisan excess — so we send more pragmatic problem-solvers to Columbia and fewer grandstanding ideologues.
Americans overwhelmingly agree that politics has become too partisan.
Polls consistently show that large majorities (about 86%) believe Republicans and Democrats spend more time fighting each other than solving real problems — and that important policy issues receive far too little attention.
Young people, in particular, believe politics has become too partisan.
For those who have long enjoyed the freedom of open primaries, mandatory party registration feels less like a formality and more like a loyalty oath — a pledge to support a party, right or wrong.
That is unthinkable for many independent voters who value the freedom to judge candidates and ideas on their merits rather than through a partisan lens.
Nor is this merely a matter of personal preference. Many business owners, professionals, and educators deliberately avoid partisan identification, mindful of how it may be perceived by customers, colleagues, or communities.
Teachers, in particular, already face unfair accusations about their beliefs and motives.
Forced party affiliation only deepens suspicion where neutrality should be respected.
As the nation approaches the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, it’s worth recalling that many of the Founding Fathers were deeply wary of political parties, which they saw as divisive and corrupting.
Their concern is reflected in the Constitution, which never mentions parties.
George Washington in his 1796 Farewell Address warned that faction would inflame passions and fracture national unity.
James Madison acknowledged that parties were inevitable but insisted they must serve “the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.”
In other words, political parties exist to serve the voters — not the other way around.
South Carolina needs less lockstep thinking and fewer purity tests, not more. We need greater independence, broader participation, and more freedom in how citizens exercise their most fundamental right: the right to vote.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2347-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-28 09:57:13.542884

Mississippi law enforcement agencies and jails with cooperative agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement could access state-funded grants, under proposed legislation. 
Senate Bill 2329, the Mississippi Glacier (ICE) Act, would reimburse law enforcement with active 287(g) agreements for expenses including subletting detention beds to ICE, equipment, travel, lodging and training programs. 
“Mississippi is not going to pretend illegal immigration is someone else’s problem,” bill author Sen. Michael McLendon, a Republican from Hernando, wrote on X last week. 
Sen. Michael McLendon, R-Hernando, speaks during an Education Committee meeting at the Capitol in Jackson, Miss., Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021.  Credit: AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis
“If you are here illegally, we are going to work with ICE to detain you and send you back to the country you came from, which more often than not is a far greater punishment than jail.”
The bill is referred to the Senate Judiciary and Appropriations committees. Bills are sometimes sent to two committees when Senate or House leaders don’t enthusiastically support them.
In the past year, 10 Mississippi agencies, sheriff’s departments and one police department have signed 287(g) agreements. Law enforcement agencies from over 30 states and two territories have signed over 1,300 agreements with ICE. 
There are four 287(g) models: The jail enforcement model allows the state and local law enforcement to help ICE identify suspected immigrants in jail, and the warrant officer model allows them to make civil administrative arrests on ICE’s behalf in jails. The task force model authorizes specially trained officers to enforce some immigration laws during routine policing. Similarly, the trivial task force model gives some immigration authority to tribal law enforcement. 
Mississippi law enforcement agencies who have a 287(g) agreement are: 

Jail enforcement model: the sheriff’s departments in Harrison, Monroe and Stone counties
Warrant service officer model: the sheriff’s departments in Harrison, Lauderdale and Stone counties
Task force model: attorney general’s office, state auditor’s office, Department of Public Safety, Stone County Sheriff’s Department, Wayne County Sheriff’s Department, Sumrall Police Department 

The attorney general’s office was the first law enforcement agency in the state to sign a 287(g) agreement. 
The bill follows a federal effort by the Department of Homeland Security, which planned in October to start reimbursing state and local law enforcement in the 287(g) program for annual salary and benefits, including overtime coverage. The funding is possible through the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that President Donald Trump signed into law last year. 
Several states have proposed legislation or created similar law enforcement immigration grant programs. 
SB 2329 defines a law enforcement agency as any agency, governmental unit or political subdivision with constitutional or statutory authority to employ or appoint people as officers, whether the agency has a unit or an internal investigations division or not. This can include private entities contracted with the state or county to operate an adult detention facility. 
The grant program would be created under the Department of Public Safety. Grants would be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis based on when the department receives a completed application, according to the bill.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/15220232/State-Capitol.jpg,,,2026-01-28 09:57:13.542884
,California,2026-01-28 15:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"California has plenty. So why do millions still struggle for food, water, and basic safety?",sponsor,,,,,https://calmatters.org/sponsored/2026/01/california-food-water-safety/,"Designing abundance into policy: creating opportunities to improve the supply, distribution, and allocation of food, water, and safety to meet basic needs.","People need three basic things: water, food, and safety. Without these essentials, we cannot survive, much less thrive. 
When we have them, it can be easy to take these essentials for granted. For many of us, we turn on the tap, and clean water fills our cup. Go to the grocery store, and food options abound. Walk around the block, and it’s safe enough to let our guard down. 
But while standard expectations to some, these everyday moments of basic well-being and security are far from guaranteed for millions of California residents. In a state of plenty, why do some people still struggle to meet their most basic needs? And what can we do to fix that? 
In the summer of 2024, the Possibility Lab invited public policy researchers from across California to share their ideas on addressing these questions. Here, we present reports from three policy experts: Nicola Ulibarri (water), Anastasia Telesetsky (food), and Mikaela Rabinowitz (public safety). According to these researchers, abundance is not only about the numeric supply of essential goods; it is also about the distribution and allocation of these resources.


Water is relatively unique among essential goods in that it is exceptionally difficult to create more of it. The amount of water on Earth today is essentially the same as billions of years ago. What does abundance mean in the context of a fixed resource?
According to Ulibarri, it means recognizing that our existing water supply is not actually scarce. In fact, water is already abundant for most California residents, whose homes are serviced by the large-scale infrastructure system that moves water from wet to dry parts of the state. However, there’s variation in terms of who can access it. 
While clean water is readily available to most people, many residents slip through the cracks. Thousands of households, especially in rural areas, are not connected to the water system, leaving them dependent on groundwater wells that can run dry during droughts or due to local over-pumping. And among those who are connected to the system, almost a million California residents receive water that doesn’t meet standards set by the Safe Drinking Water Act. Meanwhile, a growing number of California residents face new or worsening affordability challenges as water prices rise faster than inflation.     
Sustainable water abundance requires regenerating and preserving our natural ecosystems. In terms of sheer supply, California’s infrastructure already collects enough water to sustain all California residents, according to Ulibarri, so closing the equity gap does not require extracting more water from the environment. Instead, the report suggests expanding our use of water recycling technologies and distributing the existing water supply to a wider circle of residents. By investing in the infrastructure and workforce of the water system, and by changing the design of utility rates to make them more affordable, Ulibarri suggests that California can sustain water abundance for generations to come. 


Water is elemental, but food is not far behind in its essentiality. By many accounts, California already produces plentiful food. The state’s agricultural industry is a major exporter to consumers across the country and around the world. And yet, Telesetsky points out that 11.4% of California households are food insecure, meaning that millions of state residents experience limited or uncertain access to adequate food. Moreover, conventional industrial agriculture is water-intensive and soil-depleting. How can California ensure all residents have access to a nutritious diet, given these conditions?
For Telesetsky, the answer is multifaceted. Telesetsky describes a range of policy interventions that might improve access in food deserts, such as investing locally in cold food storage and subsidizing grocery delivery in underserved areas. In addition, Telesetsky suggests wider use of agricultural innovations, including seawater greenhouses and regenerative farming techniques.  
Over and above these interventions and innovations, however, Telesetsky envisions food abundance in terms of strengthening local farmers and communities. To this end, Telesetsky encourages California to pilot new models of growing and sharing food, including locally-sourced community kitchens that provide free or at-cost nutritious meals, with government funding to cover the kitchens’ overhead costs and provide basic income programs to participating local farmers. Telesetsky describes the potential of these community kitchens as not only addressing food insecurity but also cultivating connections between people and strengthening their relationships to the land. 


Community-level investments are likewise a centerpiece of Rabinowitz’s vision for abundance in public safety. Many state and local budgets allocate significant resources to the criminal justice system, but at the same time are often perceived as producing unsatisfactory results in terms of solving violent crime and improving safety outcomes. According to Rabinowitz, police officers are often expected to provide public services that are better taken on by social workers and community organizations. In particular, there is a lack of reliable funding for many community-based organizations that facilitate evidence-based programs aimed at community violence intervention through peer-to-peer mentorship. 
To support police departments in delivering on their direct law enforcement functions, and to ensure resources flow to interventions that de-escalate violence, Rabinowitz says California can do three things: Reduce, Improve, and Reinvest. By reducing the scope of non-criminal 911 calls assigned to police officers, by improving the ability of law enforcement to solve violent crime, and by reinvesting resources into community-based interventions that work, Rabinowitz argues that California can create the conditions for abundant public safety, enjoyed by all.

Achieving Abundance to Meet Basic Needs
For all their differences, these three experts on California’s water, food, and safety suggest one thing in common: they argue for stronger, more effective leadership from state government. Rabinowitz suggests creating a single Office of Violence Prevention within the California Department of Justice to consolidate and build upon existing efforts throughout the state. Meanwhile, Ulibarri and Telesetsky emphasize the need for the state to put more teeth behind existing legislation that classifies water and food as human rights.
From the floor of the state legislature to community-led initiatives across California, there are numerous opportunities to improve the supply, distribution, and allocation of resources so that all people can have their basic needs met.

The Ivy League school announced the change Tuesday and said it will take effect for students entering this fall.
Yale previously waived all expected costs for students from families earning less than $75,000 a year. By raising the limit to $100,000, the university said nearly half of American households with children ages 6 to 17 will qualify. The new policy also promises to waive tuition — but not all costs — for those with annual incomes under $200,000.
“This strategic investment is central to our mission to educate exceptional students from all backgrounds,” Provost Scott Strobel said. “The benefits are evident as these talented students enrich the Yale campus and go on to serve their communities after graduation.”
Yale follows a wave of prestigious universities that have made similar moves to help widen campus diversity in recent years, including Harvard University, Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Last fall, Harvard rolled out a nearly identical policy while Penn moved to make tuition free for families making less than $200,000 annually.
Some of the most selective colleges have doubled down on socioeconomic diversity following the Supreme Court’s rejection of affirmative action in college admissions. By recruiting more low-income students, many hoped to buoy racial diversity without running afoul of the Supreme Court. Many campuses brought record numbers of low-income students to their campuses last fall, though many saw shares of Black and Latino students decrease.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26027700186053-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 12:59:51.102120

The state has banned abortion, with a narrow exception to save a pregnant person’s life, since June 2022 under a law that took effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The lawsuit filed in Pulaski County Circuit Court said the ban violates the state’s constitutional protections for Arkansans.
Doctors told Emily Waldorf, one of the women suing over the ban, that the exception did not apply to her in September 2024 when she was 17 weeks pregnant and it became clear that she could not carry to term, the complaint states. 
“My daughter was four at the time,” Waldorf, a Fayetteville resident, told the Arkansas Advocate in an interview. “I had her at home, who I was fighting to stay alive for, because I knew that I was going to lose the baby that I was pregnant with.”
A copy of the complaint was provided to the Arkansas Advocate ahead of Wednesday’s filing by Amplify Legal, which is representing the plaintiffs challenging Arkansas’ ban.
Waldorf’s condition of cervical insufficiency meant she was at a high risk of going into labor before the fetus was viable, which put her at risk of an infection. Cervical insufficiency is when the cervix dilates during the second or early third trimester of pregnancy.
After waiting five days for care in Northwest Arkansas, Waldorf traveled 240 miles to Kansas to have an abortion via induced labor. She had to travel in an ambulance due to her risk of both infection and early labor.
The experience left her grieving a child she had wanted, on the hook for thousands of dollars in medical bills and hemorrhaging due to the delay in receiving care, according to the complaint.
Two of the other plaintiffs traveled to Illinois to terminate their pregnancies. One of the two had been sexually assaulted, according to the complaint; Arkansas’ abortion ban has no exceptions for rape or incest.
The fourth woman continued her pregnancy for seven weeks after learning it was nonviable because doctors denied her an abortion, and she and her husband discussed plans for her funeral if she did not survive the pregnancy, according to the complaint.
Arkansas law makes it a felony punishable by a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, a maximum fine of $100,000 or both for a medical professional who performs an abortion.
The lawsuit’s fifth plaintiff is Dr. Chad Taylor, an obstetrician-gynecologist practicing in Little Rock. He “regularly encounters patients with obstetrical complications where it is unclear to him and his colleagues if the standard of care for that patient — offering termination — is still legal,” the complaint states.
 The legal landscape

Arkansas’ constitution states that “enjoying and defending life and liberty [and] pursuing their own happiness” are “inherent and inalienable rights.” The abortion ban flies in the face of this constitutional mandate, said Molly Duane, the lawsuit’s lead attorney and the litigation director of Amplify Legal.
“This law is really causing people to lose their liberties, certainly lose enjoyment of their own lives, protection of their own families, and [it] is really putting lives at risk as well,” Duane said.
The lawsuit is the first filed by Amplify Legal, the litigation arm of Abortion in America, an abortion-rights advocacy group co-founded by former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, who died last year.
The lawsuit faces an uphill battle if it eventually winds up before Arkansas’ Supreme Court, where five of the seven justices have Republican ties.
The state also has anti-abortion language in its constitution. Arkansas Constitutional Amendment 68 mandates that no public funds shall be used for abortion except to save a pregnant person’s life. Duane said this provision does not override Arkansans’ fundamental rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
The amendment also states: “The policy of Arkansas is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception until birth, to the extent permitted by the Federal Constitution.”
Despite this, Duane said the plaintiffs have “very strong legal claims.” In addition to the inalienable rights argument, the plaintiffs’ case relies on the constitutional law principle that a criminal law “cannot be so vague that people who have to comply with that law have no notice, no understanding of what is legal and what is not,” Duane said.
Amplify Legal is working on several other abortion-related legal challenges that “will be filed in the coming weeks and months” in other states, Duane said.
 ‘Totally preventable’

The defendants in the lawsuit are the state of Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Attorney General Tim Griffin, Health Secretary Renee Mallory, the Arkansas State Medical Board and the three prosecuting attorneys representing the plaintiffs’ home counties.
Sanders’ predecessor, Asa Hutchinson, signed the abortion ban into law in 2019. Several other Republican governors in states with Republican-led legislatures signed their own abortion bans into law the same year. Many of those laws also place felony charges on physicians for performing abortions.
One of those states was Georgia, where Amber Thurman died in August 2022 from an infection after doctors denied her care for complications she had from taking abortion medication. The story of Thurman’s death became national news during Waldorf’s five-day hospital stay in September 2024. She said she learned about the situation while on her way to Kansas after being warned away from it previously.
“I remember being in the hospital and getting text messages from close friends saying, ‘Stay off social media right now,’” Waldorf said.
She said she decided to participate in the lawsuit because everything that happened in between learning her pregnancy was nonviable and receiving care in Kansas “was totally preventable.”
“I have a really close-knit group of friends and family that care about me and found me a way out, and so many women don’t have access to that or don’t know what to do,” Waldorf said.

Maura Healey took aim at ICE during her State of the Commonwealth speech last week, the bottom line is that Massachusetts officials have more power to deplore federal immigration actions than to stop them.","LAST YEAR, AS the Trump administration ramped up immigration enforcement and deportation efforts across American cities, Massachusetts’s top prosecutor warned that holding federal immigration agents “accountable” for their actions is a difficult task.  
“The federal authority and laws that give them such power – they have tremendous power to enforce immigration law – so you almost have to see something so egregious to possibly hold them accountable,” Attorney General Andrea Campbell said on GBH radio.   
Massachusetts was grappling at the time with the fallout from a chaotic US Immigration and Customs Enforcement action in Worcester, where local police tried to clear a crowd of people attempting to stop ICE from taking a woman into custody. Months later, communities were on high alert, and the governor was warning that deportation actions rocking Los Angeles and Chicago would come to Boston as a show of “political theater” intended to “intimidate and create fear.”  
The country is now fixed on Minnesota, where an operation that has so far involved 3,000 arrests has resulted in the fatal shooting of two US citizens in Minneapolis. These sweeps have drawn sharp rebukes from Massachusetts officials – largely Democrats – calling for deescalation and a rollback of the aggressive immigration efforts. 
Even as Gov. Maura Healey took aim at ICE during her State of the Commonwealth speech last week, the bottom line is that Massachusetts officials have more power to deplore federal immigration actions than to stop them.  
So what can the Bay State do when immigration enforcement comes knocking? Here’s a primer on where state officials stand and what policies they are and aren’t pushing.
What are Massachusetts officials worried about? 
Democrats control almost all the levers of power in the state, and they have been vocal about their horror at immigration enforcement surges across the country, including in Massachusetts.  
Healey on Monday decried the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, saying “there was no need for all of that to go down in the way that it did.” She condemned immigration agents’ tactics and said in her State of the Commonwealth speech that these aggressive surges and deportations “don’t make us safer.”
In an ICE surge in Massachusetts during September, about 1,400 people were arrested – less than half with “significant” criminal backgrounds by the agency’s own counts. Boston and other cities are gearing up for expected enforcement surges in the near future. 
Sen. Cindy Friedman of Arlington, the Senate’s point person on responding to Trump administration policies, said the killing of Pretti has added to the feeling among lawmakers that they need to take whatever action they can. “What’s happened in Minnesota, to see how far the federal government is willing to go, the urgency has increased,” said Friedman.  
The attorney general’s office is on high alert, Campbell said, and “if we see what we’re seeing in Minnesota unfold in Massachusetts, we will be ready to act. We will be ready to file lawsuits. We will be ready to seek any accountability that is necessary.” 
What are the Republicans saying? 
Prominent GOP figures in Massachusetts are for the most part not commenting on ICE tactics while expressing support for immigration enforcement. After agents shot Pretti, Republican leaders called the death a “tragedy” and expressed hope that a reportedly productive call between President Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz boded well for deescalation.  The administration on Tuesday announced that Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino was being reassigned to the southern border and “border czar” Tom Homan will begin leading on-the-ground efforts in the city. 
Amy Carnevale, chair of the Mass. GOP, told Boston 25 News after the fatal shooting of Renee Good but before the killing of Pretti that “while some criticize from the sidelines, Massachusetts Republicans stand shoulder to shoulder with those who run toward danger, protect our communities, and uphold the rule of law every single day.” 
Republican gubernatorial hopefuls Mike Kennealy and Brian Shortsleeve both said during a Massachusetts enforcement surge in September that the state would cooperate with ICE if either man were elected governor. Kennealy and Shortsleeve both worked under former governor Charlie Baker, who proposed a bill that would have allowed local law enforcement to hold certain people in custody at the request of ICE after the state Supreme Judicial Court determined those immigration-based detentions were unlawful.
While Republicans have limited power in the Legislature, House Minority Leader Brad Jones criticized Healey’s track record on immigration and shelter policy, but allowed a measured critique of ICE.  
“I don’t think anybody can look at some of the things that ICE has done in certain states and jurisdictions and be happy with that,” he said after the governor’s speech this month. “We’ve seen this course correction from a policy of open borders to round everybody up and throw them out.’ I’m much more someone who believes that we need a more centrist, middle-of-the-road approach.” 
What is the basic legal hurdle facing Massachusetts officials who would like to rein in ICE activities here? 
The US Constitution. Federal law explicitly prohibits state interference with immigration enforcement, and the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution gives federal authorities broad power over immigration policy. 
“The federal government has immense power over immigration enforcement, and that, sadly and unfortunately, includes the authority to arrest law-abiding people who are here without documentation,” Campbell said. “But that power cannot exceed their authority, so they cannot violate people’s basic constitutional rights or infringe upon a state or city’s right to protect their own residents.” 
This means state attorneys general have to play defense. If the top prosecutor in a state thinks the federal government has overstepped, as Campbell and a coalition of AGs say is the case in Minnesota and other states, they can file lawsuits or amicus briefs. The challenge in individual cases, Campbell noted, is that the federal government can quickly claim their agent has “qualified immunity” – meaning they can’t be legally punished for work they do in the course of their official duties.  
Working through the courts can be a slow process, Campbell said, and judges are being asked to consider weighty issues of federal and state sovereignty. 
“There is an opportunity for our offices – and it is only AGs that have this ability to file these lawsuits to protect our residents against constitutional threats,” Campbell said.  
Recent suits have come about because there have been two deaths, with recordings that seem to contradict the federal government’s account. “We are looking to hold them accountable, understanding it’s still difficult, even in the context of a killing like that with video recording,” Campbell said. 
What about lawmakers? 
Members of the state’s all-Democratic congressional delegation want US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign or be removed from office. Rep. Seth Moulton has filed a bill to redirect ICE funding to health care tax credits, and Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Ayanna Pressley have filed legislation to end qualified immunity for ICE agents and other federal immigration officers. Neither bill is likely to advance under the Republican-controlled House and Senate in Washington.  
State lawmakers say they have been trying to carefully craft something that balances state protections with federal supremacy on immigration. 
A policy package known as the Safe Communities Act, which has been filed every term for almost a decade, is back on the table in at least the state Senate. The legislation would prevent police and court officials from asking about immigration status, require written consent from a person in state custody before federal immigration officials can interview them, and strengthen due process protections.  
It would also ban 287(g) contracts, which are agreements between local officials and federal authorities that let the local authorities act as federal immigration agents. The state Department of Correction is the only Massachusetts law enforcement entity with a 287(g) agreement. The Department of Homeland Security announced in September that it now has more than 1,000 such agreements across the country. 
That agreement with the Department of Correction allows them to cooperate with ICE in the case of individuals with “serious felonies,” Friedman said. But those aren’t the bulk of people being targeted by the new wave of enforcement, she said.   
Legislative leaders as recently as October downplayed the need for the Safe Communities Act as advocates renewed calls for its passage. 
Along with the Safe Communities Act provisions, the state Senate is considering legislation filed by state Sen. Lydia Edwards of East Boston that would create new restrictions for immigration authorities in state courthouses. Under the bill, all law enforcement agents would need to identify themselves to court officers, they would be barred from wearing masks inside the courthouse, and be required to have a judicial warrant to detain someone on courthouse grounds. 
Edwards, an attorney, is fairly confident her bill would survive challenges from the Trump administration. She points to similar laws in Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as a 2020 New York law requiring federal immigration agents to have signed warrants for arrests on courthouse grounds, which was upheld by a federal judge in November.  
“We do have and are empowered to protect our state property, our courts, our buildings,” Edwards said. “We are legally allowed to conserve our state resources. We do not have to comply with ICE. The federal government is not allowed to conscript us into service of the federal government. So we are firmly within the powers of the 10th Amendment,” she said, citing the constitutional provision that reserves all rights not assigned to the federal government to the states and individuals.  
Is the bill on courthouse restrictions or any other legislation related to immigration likely to advance? 
Friedman said if she were a “betting person,” she would say “something’s gonna happen.”  
In the Senate, lawmakers are working through the details of potential legislation, including and expanding on Edwards’s bill, that may raise questions about the line between state and federal jurisdictions. For example, Friedman said, they may want to make sure immigrant families are able to drop their children off at school without fear of deportation. But school grounds are public grounds, and barring federal officials from public land could pose a legal challenge.  
But the Senate is just one chamber, and House leadership has not committed to new immigration-focused measures. 
The Trump administration’s actions “are an assault on the basic principles upon which this country was founded,” House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement. “While the Trump administration’s rhetoric has made it clear that they have no interest in following the law or working with state and local governments to ensure public safety, the House will continue to review legislation related to this issue with the safety of our residents in mind.” 
The Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus is scheduled to announce its immigration priorities, including a new bill with protections for immigrant communities and clearer due process guidelines, on Wednesday afternoon. 
The governor has been pretty forceful about ICE. What is she doing? 
Healey’s actions have been more limited and her rhetoric more cautious than when she served as attorney general during Trump’s first term. Practically speaking, governors have limited tools: They can speak out publicly, refuse voluntary state cooperation with federal authorities, and support legal challenges. But they cannot stop federal agents from operating in their states. 
The governor has criticized ICE tactics, calling expanded enforcement “insane”, but has repeatedly insisted Massachusetts is not a “sanctuary state” – a loosely defined term that refers to state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities – and emphasized that apprehending dangerous criminals essential for public safety.  
In December, she demanded ICE stop using Hanscom Field in Bedford for deportation flights, calling the practice “disturbing and anti-American.” Hanscom commissioners, considering whether the federal government is violating state regulation with deportation flights out of the airport, said ICE currently has aircraft that carry from 150 to 200 passengers coming and going from the aviation field three days a week on a scheduled basis. 
Healey has not, however, spoken out in favor of specific legislation or proposed new policy action. Her office did not respond to request for comment on any Massachusetts laws regarding immigration enforcement she would like to see introduced, clarified, or strengthened.  
So where does this leave Massachusetts? 
With limited tools but seizing on a moment of national outcry over Minnesota as a rallying point. Many of the details around federal immigration actions are swirling through the courts, but they are struggling to enforce their own orders.  
On the local level, Boston – with the support of the attorney general’s office – is fighting a Trump administration challenge to its Trust Act that limits local cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Campbell is also encouraging residents to share specific stories of their experiences with immigration enforcement. 
Strengthening state and local laws are meaningful moves, the AG said, but on these federal matters Congress is the major player. 
In the end, Campbell said, “the cards are stacked against all of us at the state level.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/55029299754_4950fdc761_k-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-28 11:05:45.019380

While Republicans have limited power in the Legislature, House Minority Leader Brad Jones criticized Healey’s track record on immigration and shelter policy, but allowed a measured critique of ICE.  
“I don’t think anybody can look at some of the things that ICE has done in certain states and jurisdictions and be happy with that,” he said after the governor’s speech this month. “We’ve seen this course correction from a policy of open borders to round everybody up and throw them out.’ I’m much more someone who believes that we need a more centrist, middle-of-the-road approach.” 
What is the basic legal hurdle facing Massachusetts officials who would like to rein in ICE activities here? 
The US Constitution. Federal law explicitly prohibits state interference with immigration enforcement, and the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution gives federal authorities broad power over immigration policy. 
“The federal government has immense power over immigration enforcement, and that, sadly and unfortunately, includes the authority to arrest law-abiding people who are here without documentation,” Campbell said. “But that power cannot exceed their authority, so they cannot violate people’s basic constitutional rights or infringe upon a state or city’s right to protect their own residents.” 
This means state attorneys general have to play defense. If the top prosecutor in a state thinks the federal government has overstepped, as Campbell and a coalition of AGs say is the case in Minnesota and other states, they can file lawsuits or amicus briefs. The challenge in individual cases, Campbell noted, is that the federal government can quickly claim their agent has “qualified immunity” – meaning they can’t be legally punished for work they do in the course of their official duties.  
Working through the courts can be a slow process, Campbell said, and judges are being asked to consider weighty issues of federal and state sovereignty. 
“There is an opportunity for our offices – and it is only AGs that have this ability to file these lawsuits to protect our residents against constitutional threats,” Campbell said.  
Recent suits have come about because there have been two deaths, with recordings that seem to contradict the federal government’s account. “We are looking to hold them accountable, understanding it’s still difficult, even in the context of a killing like that with video recording,” Campbell said. 
What about lawmakers? 
Members of the state’s all-Democratic congressional delegation want US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign or be removed from office. Rep. Seth Moulton has filed a bill to redirect ICE funding to health care tax credits, and Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Ayanna Pressley have filed legislation to end qualified immunity for ICE agents and other federal immigration officers. Neither bill is likely to advance under the Republican-controlled House and Senate in Washington.  
State lawmakers say they have been trying to carefully craft something that balances state protections with federal supremacy on immigration. 
A policy package known as the Safe Communities Act, which has been filed every term for almost a decade, is back on the table in at least the state Senate. The legislation would prevent police and court officials from asking about immigration status, require written consent from a person in state custody before federal immigration officials can interview them, and strengthen due process protections.  
It would also ban 287(g) contracts, which are agreements between local officials and federal authorities that let the local authorities act as federal immigration agents. The state Department of Correction is the only Massachusetts law enforcement entity with a 287(g) agreement. The Department of Homeland Security announced in September that it now has more than 1,000 such agreements across the country. 
That agreement with the Department of Correction allows them to cooperate with ICE in the case of individuals with “serious felonies,” Friedman said. But those aren’t the bulk of people being targeted by the new wave of enforcement, she said.   
Legislative leaders as recently as October downplayed the need for the Safe Communities Act as advocates renewed calls for its passage. 
Along with the Safe Communities Act provisions, the state Senate is considering legislation filed by state Sen. Lydia Edwards of East Boston that would create new restrictions for immigration authorities in state courthouses. Under the bill, all law enforcement agents would need to identify themselves to court officers, they would be barred from wearing masks inside the courthouse, and be required to have a judicial warrant to detain someone on courthouse grounds. 
Edwards, an attorney, is fairly confident her bill would survive challenges from the Trump administration. She points to similar laws in Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as a 2020 New York law requiring federal immigration agents to have signed warrants for arrests on courthouse grounds, which was upheld by a federal judge in November.  
“We do have and are empowered to protect our state property, our courts, our buildings,” Edwards said. “We are legally allowed to conserve our state resources. We do not have to comply with ICE. The federal government is not allowed to conscript us into service of the federal government. So we are firmly within the powers of the 10th Amendment,” she said, citing the constitutional provision that reserves all rights not assigned to the federal government to the states and individuals.  
Is the bill on courthouse restrictions or any other legislation related to immigration likely to advance? 
Friedman said if she were a “betting person,” she would say “something’s gonna happen.”  
In the Senate, lawmakers are working through the details of potential legislation, including and expanding on Edwards’s bill, that may raise questions about the line between state and federal jurisdictions. For example, Friedman said, they may want to make sure immigrant families are able to drop their children off at school without fear of deportation. But school grounds are public grounds, and barring federal officials from public land could pose a legal challenge.  
But the Senate is just one chamber, and House leadership has not committed to new immigration-focused measures. 
The Trump administration’s actions “are an assault on the basic principles upon which this country was founded,” House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement. “While the Trump administration’s rhetoric has made it clear that they have no interest in following the law or working with state and local governments to ensure public safety, the House will continue to review legislation related to this issue with the safety of our residents in mind.” 
The Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus is scheduled to announce its immigration priorities, including a new bill with protections for immigrant communities and clearer due process guidelines, on Wednesday afternoon. 
The governor has been pretty forceful about ICE. What is she doing? 
Healey’s actions have been more limited and her rhetoric more cautious than when she served as attorney general during Trump’s first term. Practically speaking, governors have limited tools: They can speak out publicly, refuse voluntary state cooperation with federal authorities, and support legal challenges. But they cannot stop federal agents from operating in their states. 
The governor has criticized ICE tactics, calling expanded enforcement “insane”, but has repeatedly insisted Massachusetts is not a “sanctuary state” – a loosely defined term that refers to state law limiting cooperation with immigration authorities – and emphasized that apprehending dangerous criminals essential for public safety.  
In December, she demanded ICE stop using Hanscom Field in Bedford for deportation flights, calling the practice “disturbing and anti-American.” Hanscom commissioners, considering whether the federal government is violating state regulation with deportation flights out of the airport, said ICE currently has aircraft that carry from 150 to 200 passengers coming and going from the aviation field three days a week on a scheduled basis. 
Healey has not, however, spoken out in favor of specific legislation or proposed new policy action. Her office did not respond to request for comment on any Massachusetts laws regarding immigration enforcement she would like to see introduced, clarified, or strengthened.  
So where does this leave Massachusetts? 
With limited tools but seizing on a moment of national outcry over Minnesota as a rallying point. Many of the details around federal immigration actions are swirling through the courts, but they are struggling to enforce their own orders.  
On the local level, Boston – with the support of the attorney general’s office – is fighting a Trump administration challenge to its Trust Act that limits local cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Campbell is also encouraging residents to share specific stories of their experiences with immigration enforcement. 
Strengthening state and local laws are meaningful moves, the AG said, but on these federal matters Congress is the major player. 
In the end, Campbell said, “the cards are stacked against all of us at the state level.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Campbell.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-28 09:57:13.542884

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from the House Judiciary Committee)TOPEKA — Kansas ordained clergy would be mandated reporters of child abuse under a bill proposed Monday in the House Judiciary Committee, and proponents hope this will be the year it passes. 
House Bill 2352 adds fully ordained ministers to the list of professions required to be mandatory reporters if they suspect a child has been harmed as a result of physical, mental or emotional abuse, as well as abuse, neglect or sexual abuse. Those professions include social workers, doctors, emergency medical personnel and others. 
Information received through confidential conversations, such as confessions, between clergy and church members would be an exception. This has been a sticking point in the past, as clergy have written to express how important it is that church members can participate in confession.  
Joe Cheray, an abuse survivor, told the committee that her abuser was embedded in the church she grew up attending. 
“My abuser was my grandfather, who was the president of the altar guild of our church, a major financial contributor, an usher, and during the summertime, helped with putting together the church picnic,” she said. “He always made sure he had a relationship with whatever priest who was in residence in our church. My abuse started at the age of 10 and ended at the age of 15.”
Cheray, who sat at a table when the session opened on the ground floor of the capitol to hand out information about the mandated reporting bill, hopes the bill will finally pass this year. 
“I tried going to our priest a few times during that time, and nothing happened,” she testified. “Why should it? He wasn’t a mandated reporter of abuse in the state of Kansas at the time. Had I known this, I wouldn’t have gone to him, but I didn’t know this. Later, after I got out and was in a foster home, I called him, and he said I should go home and pray that things get better.
In a letter submitted as proponent testimony, Chuck Weber, executive director of the Kansas Catholic Conference, said Kansas Catholic churches already have the reporting requirements in place outlined in the bill. 
“The Church’s child protection policies have been highly successful in preventing and responding to misconduct, and thus the church supports the adoption of similar policies that may help prevent misconduct in other organizations statewide,” Weber said. 
The Rev. Con Howerton, of Wichita’s Temple Baptist Church, brought his pastoral skills to the hearing as a proponent, citing biblical passages to tell the committee how important children are. 
“I would say, without exception, when given a choice: ‘Who do we protect, the perpetrators or the children?’ I don’t think there should be a question,” Howerton said. “We should protect the children. The Bible is pretty clear about where God’s heart is.”
Ellen Johnson, a private citizen, testified virtually about her partner who died recently. He was abused as a boy, she said, starved, neglected and beaten in the head with a baseball bat. The family regularly went to a food pantry at a church in Salina, she said. 
“His head swelled up the size of a basketball, and everybody looked the other way,” she said. “Until the day he died, he asked himself why didn’t anyone report this. If this is law, and there’s another little boy like him today — starved, neglected, abused — at that church, nobody’s going to look away. That little boy won’t have to wonder.” 
HB 2352 includes new requirements for mandated reporters to receive training in detecting and reporting child abuse, including all professions currently listed as mandated reporters. 
The training would be offered through the Kansas Department for Children and Families.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Joe-Cheray--1024x549.png,,,2026-01-28 09:57:13.542884

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Multiple parents of students at Ypsilanti Community Schools were detained by ICE agents on Tuesday, according to a letter sent to the district by Superintendent Alena Zachery-Ross. 
The arrests came after reports of ICE activity in Ypsilanti, specifically around the school campus, though the letter did not specify which school or schools were specifically targeted. The letter also did not indicate that any students were detained. 
“Our district policy remains unchanged. We do not voluntarily cooperate with ICE, nor do we grant them access to our school buildings or property without a proper judicial warrant,” Zachery-Ross wrote in the letter, adding that the district is working with the Washtenaw County Sheriff’s Office to monitor the campus borders. 
The arrests reportedly took place at a bus stop in Ypsilanti during student drop-off times, said Washtenaw County Sheriff Alyshia Dyer in a statement to MLive. The number of arrests made was not public as of the time of publication, and Dyer said it can be difficult to confirm as ICE does not provide notice to local law enforcement.
“There are no words to fully capture the pain, fear and disruption this causes for our scholars and their loved ones,” Zachery-Ross wrote. “To see our families targeted in this way is a violation of the sense of safety that every member of our community deserves. We stand in absolute solidarity with those who have been impacted.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The state agency that protects Alaska’s state-owned oil and gas from waste confirmed Friday that a small North Slope company deliberately burned off state-owned natural gas for almost four months because reinjecting the gas was inconvenient for the company.
In a starkly written order, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission confirmed a $313,616 fine against Cook Inlet Energy and implied that the firm misled regulators about the reasons for flaring gas from the Badami oil and gas field in 2024 and 2025. 
Last year, the AOGCC fined Cook Inlet Energy almost $358,000 for the flare, but the firm challenged the decision, and the fine was reduced in last week’s final order.
In Alaska, subsurface oil and gas are collectively owned by the state’s residents, and the state has strict laws that prohibit producers from wasting it. Natural gas is regularly released during oil production, and Alaska law requires that it be captured and reinjected into the ground. 
Alaska’s no-flare rule is a point of pride for the state, so much so that Gov. Mike Dunleavy once mentioned it in a State of the State address.
The state typically issues exemptions only in cases of emergency, or when a company is drilling test wells and capturing gas isn’t feasible.
One such exemption was granted in 2022 for a well being developed on state land south of Prudhoe Bay.
During AOGCC’s decision-making process, CIE claimed it should also have been eligible for an exemption. AOGCC said no.
“In the case of Great Bear Pantheon,” the agency said, referring to its 2022 exemption, “the flaring was needed to help determine project economics. In the case of CIE, the flaring was used to contribute to its bottom-line economics.”
According to the AOGCC report, Cook Inlet Energy also claimed the flaring was needed for safety reasons because a power turbine failed on the site. In reality, the report concluded, the flaring was due to a failed vapor recovery unit needed to capture gas for reinjection into the ground.
AOGCC concluded that in this case, “flaring did not occur during the power turbine outage and therefore had no direct relation to personnel safety concerns or the prevention of life-threatening conditions. Rather, the evidence demonstrates that preserving existing oil production was a primary driver for the flaring, as CIE elected to maintain full production throughout the flaring period.”
The 51 million cubic feet of gas burned off by Cook Inlet Energy is roughly equivalent to the amount needed to heat 900 homes for a year, according to national annual use estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Californians are one step closer to being able to sue federal officials — including federal immigration enforcement agents — over violations of their constitutional rights after a bill advanced in the state Senate Tuesday.
In a floor speech advocating for his bill, Sen. Scott Wiener cited the recent deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, two U.S. citizens who were shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. The San Francisco Democrat, who is also running for Congress, argued that residents’ inability, under current law, to hold federal officials accountable is “unfair and deeply harmful.” It also makes it harder for local law enforcement to carry out their jobs, Wiener said.
The proposal passed on a partyline vote, with all 10 GOP senators voting “no.” In her opposition to the bill, Sen. Shannon Grove of Bakersfield said that pulling back California’s sanctuary policies by allowing cooperation between local law enforcement and federal authorities would help mitigate the issue.

Grove: “This (federal) administration inherited a complete disaster when it comes to the immigration issue. … Both parties are at fault for the disaster that we’re facing here today.”

More on California and federal immigration activity:

ICE funding: Following Pretti’s death, at least 50 Democratic California legislators are calling for their colleagues in Congress to block further funding for immigration enforcement. The spending package, which would fund the departments of Homeland Security, Defense and others, is currently before the U.S. Senate. California lawmakers are concerned that Senate Democrats in battleground states might give the package enough votes to send it to President Donald Trump’s desk for approval.

San Diego sues the feds: Earlier this month the city of San Diego filed a lawsuit against the federal administration over razor wire fencing on city land near the Mexican border. The city claims that U.S. Marines illegally trespassed to put up the fence, and that the fence harms sensitive habitats. Read more from CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan.

A California bill that would allow a Chula Vista community college to expand its bachelor’s programs is setting off a wider dispute among the state’s public higher education systems, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn. 
Assembly Bill 664 — which is before the Senate after clearing the Assembly Monday — would enable Southwestern College to create up to four additional bachelor’s programs in applied disciplines, such as teaching English to non-English speakers and designing websites. Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Chula Vista Democrat and the bill’s author, said his proposal aims to develop programs to fill labor force needs in his district.
Both the University of California and California State University oppose the bill, arguing that it would undermine a 2021 state law by paving the way for more community colleges to duplicate baccalaureate programs that the university systems already offer.

‘Mansion tax’ stays as is, for now

Los Angeles’ city council voted Tuesday to reject a proposal that would have potentially resulted in the city changing its 2022 tax on high-value real estate sales, reports CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.
The failed motion would have placed a measure on the June 2026 local ballot asking voters to approve some exceptions to the city’s “mansion tax,” which so far has raised more than $1 billion in revenue for affordable housing development and rental assistance for low-income tenants. Real estate developers, commercial landlords and pro-housing policymakers say the tax stifles housing production and investment.
A growing number of state and local lawmakers, like the failed proposal’s author Councilmember Nithya Raman, fear that local opposition to the tax will help fuel a statewide ballot measure campaign underway by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. That potential measure could have dire consequences for municipal budgets. Raman’s proposal sought to allay local concerns so as to head off potential allies of the Howard Jarvis initiative.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital before he was shot and killed by federal agents Saturday morning on Nicollet Avenue. Family and friends, as well as former coworkers and teachers, described him as generous and kind-hearted.
“Through his work at the VA caring for the sickest patients, and passion to advance cancer research, he touched more lives than he probably ever realized,” said his sister Micayla Pretti, 32, in a statement. “All Alex ever wanted was to help someone — anyone. Even in his very last moments on this earth, he was simply trying to do just that.” 
Videos from multiple angles of the killing show Pretti helping a woman who agents appeared to have pushed to the ground, after which eight agents tackle Pretti. 
The videos show Pretti disarmed of a gun he never drew before he was shot by federal agents multiple times, contradicting the immediate narrative set by senior Trump administration officials that Pretti had posed a clear and present danger — including immediate accusations from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller that Alex Pretti was a domestic terrorist. 
Pretti’s family members have since denounced the Trump administration in public statements. 
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed,” said Michael and Susan Pretti, his parents, in a statement to media outlets Saturday. 
In the aftermath of the shooting, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara confirmed that Pretti, who Homeland Security said was carrying a gun, was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. O’Hara said police have not interacted with Pretti other than a few traffic tickets.
CNN reported that a group of federal agents tackled Pretti a week before he was killed, breaking a rib. 
His parents told the Associated Press that they had told him in a recent conversation to be careful when protesting. He had also participated in George Floyd protests in 2020, his ex-wife told the AP. 
‘A kindhearted soul’
His parents described him as “a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans” he cared for as a nurse. 
His sister said Pretti “had a way of lighting up every room he walked into” and “made people feel safe.” 
Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wis., where he graduated from Preble High School in 2006, a Green Bay school district spokesperson confirmed. Former teachers said he was a leader in choirs and in school drama productions. He was also a longtime member of the Green Bay Boy Choir. 
Kristen Radke, creative director of the technology news site The Verge, wrote about growing up with Pretti as a neighbor and childhood friend. Radke, whose family moved away before she started high school, said Pretti was “generous, curious, sweet” as a kid. 
“He loved mandarin oranges and macaroni and cheese, and we agreed it was especially pleasing when all the food on our plates was orange,” Radke wrote. 
At a Monday Green Bay Board of Education meeting, Pretti’s former teachers and classmates remembered him as a friendly, funny and kind member of their community. 
“I can vividly see him in my mind, standing in the bass section, right in front of me, second row, encouraging the young men around him with his quiet leadership skills,” said Susan McAllister, who taught Pretti in Preble’s music program. 
“One of the things that he always did was brighten everyone’s day with a joke or a witty comment, and I can see him doing that with the veterans as well,” said Carol Miller, who directed plays and musicals that Pretti was in. 
Travis Vanden Heuvel, another childhood friend of Pretti’s, said at the school board meeting that Pretti was a “helper” and “kindness incarnate.”
Life in Minnesota
Pretti later attended the University of Minnesota and graduated in 2011, a U spokesperson confirmed. On an outdated LinkedIn page, Pretti is listed as a junior scientist at the University of Minnesota Medical School starting in 2012. He later went to nursing school and became an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital. State records show Pretti has been a registered nurse since 2021. 
Dimitri Drekonja, an infectious diseases researcher, said in a Bluesky post that Pretti was a colleague of his at the Minneapolis VA, when Pretti’s job was recruiting for clinical trials before he became an ICU nurse. 
“He was a good kind person who lived to help and these f*ckers executed him,” Drekonja wrote. 
Pretti researched cancer treatments and is listed as a co-author on a 2023 cancer research poster as an affiliate of GeneSegues, a cancer research startup spun out of research at the U. 
Pretti lived in the Lyndale neighborhood of south Minneapolis, according to online records — around a mile and a half from where he was killed, and a mile from where an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good on Jan. 7. He enjoyed mountain biking and gravel biking, a representative of Pretti’s family said. Angry Catfish Bicycle, a bike shop in Minneapolis, said in a social media post that he had been a member of the local cycling community and had frequented the store. 
Pretti had a Catahoula Leopard dog named Joule who had recently died, whom he had adopted from a rescue shelter and took everywhere with him, the family’s representative said. 
A viral video published on Facebook shows Pretti delivering the final salute to Air Force veteran Terry Randolph at a VA hospital in 2024. The video was posted by the veteran’s son, Mac Randolph, who said in the caption that his father “would be honored in Alex’s sacrifice, and ashamed of this current administration.” 
In the video, Pretti reads in front of a gurney covered with a Department of Veterans Affairs flag: “Today we remember that freedom is not free. We have to work at it, nurture it, protect it, and even sacrifice for it.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alexprettitwo-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-28 11:05:45.019380

The city of San Diego is suing the federal government for building razor wire fencing on city land near the Mexican border, arguing that the fence damages sensitive habitat and trespasses on city property.
The lawsuit, filed with the federal Southern District Court on Jan. 5, names the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense, along with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other federal officials. It argues that U.S. Marines illegally entered city land in December and built fences in Marron Valley, east of Otay Mountain.
The fences caused “irreparable harm to protected plant and wildlife habitats, riparian areas, and vernal pools” the city argued, saying the fence blocks city access to the site and jeopardizes conservation programs designed to protect that habitat. The city is asking the court to halt any more fence construction and declare the city’s right to ownership and use of the land.
“The City of San Diego will not allow federal agencies to disregard the law and damage city property,” City Attorney Heather Ferbert said in a statement. “We are taking decisive action to protect sensitive habitats, uphold environmental commitments, and ensure that the rights and resources of our community are respected.”
The Department of Defense declined to comment, citing pending litigation. The Department of Homeland Security didn’t respond to questions from CalMatters, and neither agency has filed responses to the lawsuit yet.
The case represents a new front in California’s battle with the Trump administration over immigration enforcement and the role of federal power versus state and local authority.
The most high-profile conflicts have concerned the use of National Guard and active duty military in California cities. In December a federal judge ordered the National Guard to leave Los Angeles and return to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s control. Shortly afterward the Supreme Court blocked deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, effectively shutting down the administration’s appeals against California.
In this case the fight is over wildlands instead of urban neighborhoods.
In a statement supporting the city’s lawsuit the Sierra Club criticized “the expansion of militarized zones” without “adequate environmental review, oversight, or coordination with landowners and conservation partners.”
“The reckless deployment of concertina wire in Marron Valley is a clear abuse of power,” Erick Meza, the Sierra Club’s Borderlands Program Coordinator said. “We should not allow short-term political stunts to destroy a legacy of stewardship that belongs to us all.”
A photo of the site shows a stack of razor wire, also known as concertina wire, extending across brushy land along the Mexican border. The city alleges that about a dozen U.S. Marines built the fencing, crossing trails in environmentally protected areas and leaving trash that included survey stakes, markers, discarded wooden palettes, unused wire and abandoned vehicles. 
The city property is part of San Diego’s Multiple Species Conservation Program, a network of open space that protects 85 sensitive and endangered species. It’s also part of a habitat plan between the city, California Department of Fish and Wildlife and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, called the Cornerstone Lands Conservation Bank Agreement.
The case claims the wire fencing prevents city staff from managing the site, and damages sensitive streamside habitat and songbirds that use it, such as the endangered least Bell’s vireo. It also harms vernal pools,a system of seasonal water bodies that host endangered fairy shrimp.
The complaint says the federal agencies built the fence without city approval or even notice.
“At no time did defendants seek or obtain the city’s consent to build the border barrier at issue,” the lawsuit states. “At no time did defendants give public notice of, or seek public comment on their intention to build the border barrier on city property.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012726-SD-Barbed-Wire-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-28 08:57:41.290722

David Hayes-Bautista
David Hayes-Bautista is a distinguished professor of medicine at UCLA and co-authors Latino GDP Reports. 


California has a third of the population of Japan — 39.4 million versus 122.8 million — but it has a larger gross domestic product than Japan. If California were its own country, it would have the world’s fourth largest economy; Japan would be fifth.
What is California’s secret GDP sauce? In three words: Latino GDP growth. 
Gross Domestic Product measures the final value of goods and services a country produces. It describes an economy’s size and productivity.
In California the state’s 15.1 million Latinos generated more than $1 trillion of economic activity in 2023. The Latino GDP grew more than twice as fast as the state’s non-Latino GDP — before, during and after COVID-19 — because the Latino labor force grew 15 times faster than the non-Latino workforce. 
It also worked harder. Following a decades-long trend, in 2023 Latinos’ participation in the labor force was 5.5 percentage points higher than non-Latinos’ participation. Latinos also were more likely to work in the private sector than non-Latino workers. 
With more people, working harder, and in the private sector – Latinos’ vigorous work ethic lifted California’s economy above Japan’s.
Latinos also are more entrepreneurial than non-Latino demographic groups, setting up businesses and growing them at faster rates. While it might be easy to assume these businesses would be in construction and agriculture, in 2023 the largest sectors of the California Latino GDP were finance, insurance, business services and real estate. 
One of the large, rapidly growing economic sectors is health. Interestingly, for 175 years, California has done a poor job of producing Latino healthcare providers, such as doctors, dentists, nurses and others. How did health care become a large sector of California’s Latino GDP when mainstream providers avoided Latino areas?
A new type of health organization arose in Latino communities to fill the service vacuum: Community clinics, governed by community boards, focused on preventive services and health promotion for underserved areas.
One example is AltaMed. What had been a community clinic in a Los Angeles storefront has grown to become one of the largest federally qualified health center operations in the country. 
Founded in 1969, at the height of the Chicano movement, the East LA Barrio Free Clinic began as a volunteer organization, living month-to-month on irregular donations of supplies. By 1977, with an operating budget of $50,000, it could barely afford a couple of employees. 
The little organization suddenly took off, economically speaking. AltaMed now serves more than 700,000 patients annually at more than 60 sites. It employs more than 5,700 people — who are paid competitive wages — and its operating budget in 2024 was $1.64 billion.
But the growth doesn’t end there. AltaMed employees spend their wages in local stores and restaurants, driving growth in those sectors. A nonprofit business, AltaMed contracts with local suppliers and service providers. As it expands its footprint, it hires architects and contracts with construction companies.
Far from its storefront days, AltaMed today has a direct and indirect economic impact of $15.1 billion. 
During the last decades of the 20th century, up to 2024, California’s Latino population grew from 1.4 million to 15.1 million. This population growth drove labor force growth, business growth and a Latino GDP growth that’s twice as fast as the rest of the state. 
If it were not for the Latino GDP, California wouldn’t be No. 4 in the world. It would be No. 8, near Italy. California would be much poorer and less competitive without Latinos’ work ethic and business drive.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/110724_Latino-Voters_LV_CM_24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-28 08:57:41.290722

The latest bill would allow Southwestern College to create up to four additional bachelor’s programs aimed at workforce needs in south San Diego County. 


In the past two years, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed three bills that would have allowed community colleges to award students more bachelor’s degrees. Unfazed, lawmakers are now backing a fourth bill that does much of the same.
The measure, Assembly Bill 664, cleared its first legislative tests by passing the Assembly Jan. 26, potentially setting up another collision course between state lawmakers and the governor. While Newsom supports more bachelor’s degrees for students, he’s repeatedly stated his opposition to adding more community college baccalaureate programs that go outside an agreed-upon process in a law that he and lawmakers approved in 2021. 
That law said community colleges can develop up to 30 bachelor’s degrees per academic year, as long as the degrees do not duplicate the baccalaureate programs of the University of California and California State University.
But since then, community colleges and Cal State have disagreed on what counts as duplication, resulting in more than a dozen stalled community college bachelor’s programs because Cal State opposed them. Both public university systems oppose the latest bill. They fear more community colleges will seek their own degrees that duplicate what the universities offer, unraveling the 2021 law.The universities see themselves as the traditional generators of bachelor’s degrees. Community colleges say the state is too big and spread out to limit public four-year degrees to just the Cal State and UC.
Students shouldn’t be forced to enroll in universities dozens or hundreds of miles from home when the community college a few miles away can offer a bachelor’s degree that employers in the area say more workers need, bill backers say. Those backers include its main author, Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Democrat from Chula Vista. 
His bill would allow the community college in his district, Southwestern College, to create up to four additional bachelor’s programs in applied disciplines, such as teaching English to speakers of other languages and designing websites. Alvarez stresses that his bill isn’t creating more general bachelor’s degree programs popular at the universities, such as psychology. Rather, he’s seeking to develop programs employers seek in the south San Diego County area. 
While his bill is limited to just his district, Alvarez told fellow lawmakers Jan. 13 to follow his lead in creating bachelor’s degree programs at their local community colleges if they have unmet labor market needs. “I would expect nothing less from each one of you to do what I’m trying to do here.”The 2021 law limiting community college bachelor’s degree creation “has fallen short,” he said then. 
In an interview, Alvarez doubled-down on the point that too many communities have adults eager to earn a bachelor’s degree but either cannot get into an over-enrolled public university or live too far away.“California is about providing opportunity and access to students,” Alvarez said. “Are we actually doing that in the state? I would say the answer to that today is we are falling very, very short.” 
But the former chancellor of the state’s community college system thinks Alvarez’s bill, however well intentioned, is the wrong approach. 
“I have, from the beginning, been opposed to community colleges offering baccalaureate degrees,” said Eloy Ortiz Oakley. “I think it is a mistake.” He was system chancellor when the first community college bachelor’s degrees were underway. Now he thinks a better solution is to send professors at under-enrolled Cal State campuses to community colleges that want bachelor’s degrees, such as Southwestern.Developing more bachelor’s programs means hiring additional full-time faculty and administrators. It’s an approach that adds costs to public systems of higher education at a time when the state government is projecting multi-billion dollar deficits. Creating new bachelor’s degrees also takes two to three years before they’re offered to students, he said. If there’s market demand now, colleges and universities should collaborate by merging academic staff now as well, Oakley said. He now leads the College Futures Foundation, which is a CalMatters funder.
Alvarez notes that his bill requires Southwestern College to collaborate with nearby universities to create smoother pathways for students to earn bachelor’s degrees — similar to Oakley’s recommendation. Alvarez notes that Southwestern is doing the work to bolster degree attainment; it’s launching bachelor’s degrees programs so that nearby university professors teach on the Southwestern campus. However, he maintains that the college needs a legal dispensation to offer the bachelor’s programs his community needs.The emphasis on existing collaboration with the four-year campuses makes him think Newsom won’t veto his bill, he said. Lawmakers will have until Aug. 31 to send the bill to the governor.
Appeal of community college bachelor’s
Community college bachelor’s degrees are cheaper than the ones offered at UC and Cal State,  at about $10,000 for all four years. That’s a win for students chasing affordability who may not qualify for the state’s tuition waivers to the public universities, though about 60% of California students at UC and Cal State do. 
California’s community colleges are relative novices at awarding these degrees: The first ones debuted about a decade ago. Now, around 300 students earn bachelor’s degrees at community colleges annually, compared to around 160,000 at the UC and Cal State. As a result, economic data is limited on whether these community college degrees lead to the higher pay that bachelor’s degrees offered by the two public universities yield. 
A recent academic study published in the National Bureau of Economic Research reviewed several other states and found that community college bachelor’s degrees lead to higher wages than associate degrees would but slightly lower earnings compared to bachelor’s degrees from traditional universities. Results varied by major.
Nor does the community college system publish public data on the graduation rates of students who pursue bachelor’s degrees. The UC and Cal State do — and must by state and federal law.“We do not have this information packaged in a public-facing tool like CSU provides,” wrote Melissa Villarin, a spokesperson for the California Community Colleges, in an email.
Public universities oppose bill
Both the UC and Cal State say the latest bill circumvents the 2021 law that allows community colleges to develop bachelor’s programs annually as long as the degrees do not duplicate existing programs at the two university systems. Under the law, both systems get to weigh in on whether there’s duplication. But under Alvarez’s bill, UC and Cal State can’t appeal the programs Southwestern launches.
The law supercharged the creation of community college bachelor’s programs — more than 50 are now approved at around 40 colleges. Before the law, 15 community colleges each offered one bachelor’s degree.
Left unsaid by Cal State officials during a bill hearing Jan. 13 is the fear that more community college bachelor’s programs will pull students from Cal State. But a Cal State administrator made just that point when lawmakers in 2024 introduced two bills that would allow several community colleges to award bachelor’s degrees in nursing. Those nursing bills cleared the Legislature but Newsom vetoed both. Cal State professors also worried about revenue losses from community college bachelor’s degrees in 2022 after the 2021 law passed.  
Several lawmakers are also on record in favor of more community colleges providing bachelor’s degrees to address local workforce needs and create a more affordable option for students who can’t leave their communities.
“Baccalaureate programs at community colleges are the answer. I hope there’s more encroachment,” said Assemblymember Patrick Ahrens, a Democrat from Cupertino, during a legislative hearing on the bill Jan. 13.The bill cleared the Assembly 69-1. 
Duplication has been a multi-year battle
In 2023, two leading lawmakers on higher education issues wrote to community colleges that they cannot duplicate existing UC and Cal State degrees, regardless of location. The letter came as one community college created a bachelor’s in fire management that resembled a bachelor’s degree — not yet in existence — that was slated to be offered at a Cal State nearly 300 miles away. Cal State opposed the community college degree, but the college launched it anyway.The issue was an ongoing one — the community college system in 2022 suggested that how far a college is from a public university can be a factor in whether a degree is duplicative of the university’s. The 2023 legislative letter seemingly supersedes that 2022 belief. 
Since the 2021 law through April of last year, the community colleges submitted 52 bachelor’s programs for approval, according to a document Cal State shared with CalMatters. Of those, 16 programs remain pending because of Cal State’s duplication concerns and seven had duplication concerns that the segments resolved. The other 28 programs were approved without any duplication concerns. The remaining degree, in fire management, is the only one Cal State labels as one the system opposed but that a community college created anyway.
Southwestern, which is near the U.S. border with Mexico, has sought a bachelor’s program in binational environmental architecture that has been disputed by Cal Poly Pomona for more than a year. That campus offers a similar program, without the binational emphasis.
Duplication hinges on whether the courses are similar, but the evaluation doesn’t consider whether the university with the existing degree has the capacity to enroll all the students who desire that workforce skill, said Southwestern College President Mark Sancez at the Jan. 13 hearing, in defense of Alvarez’s bill.Southwestern College student Marilynn Palomino is in the process of earning an associate degree in criminal justice to work in a police crime lab doing forensic work. That position requires a bachelor’s degree, wrote Chris Jonsmyr, a spokesperson for Alvarez, in an email. But the only forensics bachelor’s at a public university in California is at San Jose State University, some 500 miles away, said Jonsmyr. Alvarez’s bill would lead to an applied forensics bachelor’s at Southwestern as one of the four programs it’s proposing, his staff said.Palomino is a single mother with a son and daughter. “Transferring would require relocating hundreds of miles away with my children or leaving them behind,” she told lawmakers Jan. 13.
Community colleges far from public universities
Several data points are a driving force in bringing bachelor’s degrees to community colleges. One is that 29 of the state’s 116 community colleges are at least 25 miles from a public university, leaving many students “place-bound” or regionally stuck in the area their community colleges serve. About 150,000 students attend these colleges that are far from public universities.Students at community colleges that are within 25 miles of a public university transfer to a four-year university at higher rates than those that are farther away.Community colleges have low transfer rates — just 21% of students who wanted to transfer do so after four years, a state report said. This could be a sign of a broken transfer system that might be remedied if more colleges could offer bachelor’s degrees. Or it could mean colleges aren’t ready to expand their services when they’ve struggled to graduate more students with degrees and certificates or transfer them at higher rates.
“Why would you create a new product when the bulk of your products are failing?” asked Oakley, the former community college system chancellor.
Enough students to go around
While Alvarez and Oakley disagree on whether bachelor’s degrees for community colleges is the solution to bring more students into bachelor’s programs, both say Cal State isn’t meeting the moment.After steady enrollment growth throughout the 2010s, Cal State has struggled financially because roughly half of its campuses are contending with enrollment declines. Thirteen of the system’s 23 campuses had lower enrollments than their state targets last year.That’s perplexing to Alvarez and Oakley, given that Cal State tuition is still relatively low, despite recent annual tuition hikes. Both also observe that other universities with higher tuition are attracting tens of thousands of students. There are about 113,000 California students at for-profit colleges that award bachelor’s degrees. Despite its affordability, Cal State is not winning over these students.“In the CSU, they have failed to sort of re-create themselves in a way that’s relevant to what learners need today,” Oakley said.
Added Alvarez: “I’m surprised, really, that there’s so much indignation at the fact that we want to provide easier access to higher education for students when there’s plenty of students and plenty of need.”
Davis Jenkins, a research professor on community colleges at Columbia University, agrees. Even if community colleges increased the number of bachelor’s degrees they award 10-fold to 3,000, “which would take years,” he said, “I don’t think CSU has anything to worry about.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/052424_Southwestern-College-Graduation_AH_CM_26.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-28 08:57:41.290722

Psychiatric hospitals could close beds under proposed state rules if regulators don’t allow implementation time, facilities warn.


The California Department of Public Health delayed emergency staffing rules for acute psychiatric hospitals after significant outcry from hospitals, nurses, law enforcement and lawmakers.
The proposed rules, which would increase the required number of health workers on staff, were set to take effect Jan. 31, roughly one month after the department first published them.
Instead, the department said in a letter to health care facilities that the rules will go into effect June 1.
The emergency rules stem from a San Francisco Chronicle investigation that linked cases of physical assault, sexual assault and death to low staffing levels at for-profit acute psychiatric hospitals. The investigation revealed a loophole in state regulations that allowed acute psychiatric hospitals to employ fewer staff than general hospitals. 
Acute psychiatric hospitals treat people — sometimes involuntarily —  experiencing mental health crises and who pose an immediate threat to themselves or others.
The proposed rules would require acute psychiatric hospitals to have at all times at least one licensed nurse per six adult patients or one licensed nurse per five pediatric patients. The health department would also fine hospitals $15,000 to $30,000 for each day they are out of compliance.
But hospitals, law enforcement organizations and behavioral health groups say the state’s aggressive implementation timeline will inadvertently lead to the closure of dozens, if not hundreds, of psychiatric beds throughout the state.
Carmela Coyle, president and chief executive of the California Hospital Association, said the four-month delay “averts an immediate crisis in the availability of psychiatric hospital care in California” but still leaves the system vulnerable to closures.
The hospital association had previously estimated that more than 800 acute psychiatric beds would close Saturday if the state did not delay implementation and allow facilities adequate time to hire more staff.
The delay gives hospitals some time to prepare but falls short of the one-year phase-in period many facilities had sought. 
Le Ondra Clark Harvey, chief executive of the California Behavioral Health Association, said the emergency regulations don’t account for the behavioral health workforce shortage that has plagued California for years. 
Over the next five years, the state’s Department of Health Care Access and Information projects that all 58 counties in California will face shortages of behavioral health professionals. State prisons, state hospitals and developmental centers also face persistent difficulties in hiring enough behavioral health staff, in part because of workforce trends.
Clark Harvey said the regulations need to protect patients and preserve access to existing behavioral health services. “We don’t need rules that risk worsening an already very, very fragile system,” she said.
When psychiatric beds aren’t available, patients get stuck in emergency rooms, causing backlogs, said Jesse Tamplen, executive administrator of behavioral health at John Muir Health. 
John Muir Health, a not-for-profit health system in the Bay Area, operates roughly 10% of all pediatric psychiatric beds in the state and takes patients routinely from as far as San Diego and even Oregon. The hospital will need to hire about 30 more nurses by June. If it can’t, it will have to reduce the number of inpatient psychiatric beds available. 
“I support CDPH creating regulations to improve safety and quality. That’s not a question,” Tamplen said. “Our regulators are there to support safety and quality. My concern is the speed and the likelihood of unintended consequences.”
The California Nurses Association, which helped pass the state’s first hospital staffing requirements in 1999, takes a different issue with the state’s proposed regulations. The proposed rules allow acute psychiatric hospitals to count licensed vocational nurses and psychiatric technicians toward the staffing ratio. The nurses association, which represents more than 100,000 nurses in the state, argues that only registered nurses should qualify. 
“The state is proposing an inferior staffing standard for acute psychiatric hospitals compared to general acute-care hospitals, and that’s unacceptable to California Nurses Association nurses,” the group said in a statement.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012726-John-Muir-Health-SC-Getty-CM-01-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-28 08:57:41.290722

The California Senate passed a bill that would make it easier to sue federal officers over civil rights violations. Recent shootings of civilians by immigration agents in Minnesota lent urgency to the measure, one of several targeting ICE.


California Democratic senators advanced a measure Tuesday that would make it easier for people to sue federal agents over civil rights violations, a bill shaped by fears of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement practices.
The bill from Sens. Scott Wiener and Aisha Wahab, both Bay Area Democrats, took on additional significance after federal agents gunned down Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen and ICU nurse, in Minnesota last weekend. Senators discussed the measure on the floor for more than 90 minutes before voting along party lines, 30 to 10, to send it to the Assembly.
“It’s a sad statement on where we are in this country that this has to be a partisan issue,” Wiener said just before the vote on his bill, which is also known as the “No Kings Act”. “Red, blue, everyone has constitutional rights. And everyone should have the ability to hold people accountable when they violate those rights.”
It’s among several bills lawmakers are moving forward in the new year to confront an escalation of aggressive immigration enforcement tactics and to protect immigrant communities. They include bills that would tax for-profit detention companies, prohibit law enforcement officers from moonlighting as federal agents and attempt to curb courthouse arrests.
Those efforts follow a slate of legislation signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year to resist the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign in California, including a first-in-the nation measure to prohibit officers from wearing masks and others that limit their access to schools and hospitals. 
While some of those laws are facing legal challenges, the new batch of proposals offer “practical solutions that are squarely within the state’s control,” said Shiu-Ming Cheer, deputy director at California Immigrant Policy Center.
Here’s a look at some of the key bills lawmakers are considering:
No moonlighting as a federal agent
Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Democrat from Culver City, authored a bill that would prohibit law enforcement from taking a side job as a federal immigration agent. 
At a press conference in San Francisco earlier this month, Bryan said the measure is especially timely as the federal administration ramps up its recruitment of California’s local law enforcement.
“We don’t collaborate in the kidnapping of our own community members, but there is a loophole in state law,” he said. “While you can’t collaborate with ICE while you are working in your police shift, you can take a second job with the Department of Homeland Security. And I don’t think that that is right.”
In an interview with CalMatters, he said the legislation is intended to bring transparency and accountability, and to close that loophole.
“The federal administration has created not just a secret police but a secret military at the expense of health care, social safety nets, and key benefits that the American people need and rely on to make it through the day,” said Bryan. “All of those resources have been rerouted to the unaccounted militarized force patrolling our streets and literally killing American citizens.”
Keep ICE awy from courthouses
Sen. Eloise Gómez Reyes, a Democrat from San Bernardino, introduced legislation to prevent federal immigration agents from making “unannounced and indiscriminate” arrests in courthouses. 
“The issue is clear cut,” said Gómez Reyes in a statement. “One of the core responsibilities of government is to protect people — not to inflict terror on them. California is not going to let the federal government make political targets out of people trying to be good stewards of the law. Discouraging people from coming to court makes our community less safe.”
The legislation was introduced nearly two weeks after a federal judge ordered that the U.S. Justice Department halt civil arrests in immigration courts across Northern California, ruling that its deportation policies hadn’t addressed the “chilling effects, safety risks, and impacts on hearing attendance.”
Efforts to bolster protections in California courthouses have also been championed by Sen. Susan Rubio, a Democrat from West Covina, who introduced a bill that would allow remote courthouse appearances for the majority of civil or criminal state court hearings, trials or conferences until January 2029. 
Taxing detention centers
Assemblymember Matt Haney, a Democrat from San Francisco, introduced a bill that would place a 50% tax on profits from immigration detention centers. Over 5,700 people are being held in seven immigration detention centers across California, three of which are located in Kern County.
Escalating ‘resistance’
Cheer, of California Immigrant Policy Center, said the early introduction of the bills demonstrates more urgency from the state Legislature to tackle issues around immigration enforcement.  
“My hope for this year is that the state can be as bold and innovative as possible seeing the crisis communities are facing from immigration enforcement,” she said.
That means ensuring funding for attorneys to represent people facing deportation, addressing existing gaps in state laws around information sharing with the federal government, and looking into companies that are directly profiting from the business of arresting and deporting people, Cheer said.

Republicans have criticized the measures, which they characterize as overstepping on federal priorities. 
“No one likes to see what’s happening in Minnesota. No one wants to see that coming to California,” said Sen. Tony Strickland, a Republican representing Huntington Beach. Instead, he argued, cities and states should jettison their so-called “sanctuary” policies that hamper coordination between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. 
He also criticized Democrats for taking precious Senate time to prepare for hypothetical scenarios rather than addressing existing problems in California.
“At the end of the day, we have a lot of serious issues here in California, and we need to start focusing on California-specific issues.”
Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said state and local governments are trying to figure out how far to go in resisting federal immigration enforcement given Trump’s threats to pull funding from sanctuary jurisdictions.  
“While there’s concern and fear in immigrant communities, there’s some solace being given by the support expressed by state and local officials,” he said. “As the Trump administration escalates its aggressive deportation tactics across the nation, California has escalated its resistance.”

,California,2026-01-28 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California budget volatility continues to complicate efforts to close its deficits,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/volatility-complicates-california-budget-deficits/,"California's budgets have been susceptible to the ways wealthy taxpayers derive their income, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty.","California legislators are facing a fifth straight budget where spending would outstrip its revenues, amid warnings of multibillion-dollar deficits stretching well into the future unless they either reduce outlaws or increase income.
Legislative analyst Gabe Petek, in his overview of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposed $349 billion 2026-27 budget, says the deficits totaled $125 billion over the last four years and “have persisted even as the state’s economy and revenues have grown, underscoring that the problem is structural rather than cyclical. Taken together, these trends raise serious concerns about the state’s fiscal sustainability.”
The proposed budget projects $227 billion in general fund revenues and $248 billion in general fund spending. Newsom has promised that when the budget — his last as governor — is revised in May, it will close not only its deficit but address the ongoing deficits. Petek and Newsom’s Department of Finance project them in the range of $20 billion to $35 billion a year.
How Newsom would do that while opposing major tax increases is still to be revealed. Meanwhile initial hearings in both legislative houses featured speculation from members on how the budget could be balanced, including sharp spending cuts and tax increases.
The hearings also saw renewed interest in another factor from years past: volatility.
Sen. Jerry McNerney, a Stockton Democrat who chairs the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee, noted that the state’s major revenue source of personal income taxes can vary widely from year to year, making them difficult to reliably project.
“I think it’s time for a statewide discussion about how to even out this volatility, even though those are difficult conversations — it’s been noted, it’s been tried before,” McNerney said.
The proposed budget estimates that personal income taxes will supply 68% of general fund revenues, and high-income taxpayers will pay the bulk of those taxes. Wealthy Californians derive much of their income from capital gains, which can vary widely year to year depending on how their investments fare.
The volatility factor has its greatest effect on the budget during periods of economic uncertainty, when investment earnings swing widely. During past recessions, California has experienced as much as 20% revenue declines.
California’s budgets became dependent on a relatively few high-income taxpayers over the last four decades, as income taxes surpassed sales taxes to become the most important revenue source.
Income taxes exceeded sales taxes for the first time in 1983. The gap has steadily increased since then, as a detailed chart in the budget’s addendum reveals. The progressive structure of the income tax system ensures that high-income taxpayers supply most of its revenue.
The Great Recession that struck California in 2007 drove the volatility factor home. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and legislative leaders created a blue ribbon commission to recommend steps to make revenues more predictable. Months of hearings ensued and a sharply divided commission finally recommended lowering the state’s dependence on income taxes and substituting a revised sales tax that would extend to more transactions.
The report was never seriously considered. When Jerry Brown succeeded Schwarzenegger in 2011, he championed “rainy day” reserves that would, he said, cushion volatility’s impacts during economic downturns.
However, during the last four years of chronic deficits, Newsom and legislators have tapped those reserves to cover the gaps, even though there’s been no recession, breaking promises to preserve them.
“We’re not touching these reserves,” Newsom said three years ago. “We’re in a very volatile moment.”
Petek has warned of a possible downturn — with big revenue declines — if the artificial intelligence stock market boom fades. It happened in 2000 when the dot-com tech boom imploded.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012325-Capitol-Session-FG-CM-48.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-28 08:57:41.290722

(Will Ruzanski/Utah News Dispatch)A Republican-majority committee of Utah lawmakers voted 11-3 on Tuesday to advance a bill to turn the state’s 2023 moratorium on newly prescribed hormonal transgender treatments for Utahns under the age of 18 into a full ban despite objections from parents saying the gender-affirming care has saved their kids’ lives.
In the same meeting, the House Health and Human Services Committee also advanced two other bills that would restrict public employers — including cities, school districts or other taxpayer-funded employers — from providing insurance to employees that covers gender-affirming treatment for transgender people while also requiring them to cover “detransition” treatments.
All three of those bills now go to the full House for consideration. 
The votes came despite hours of testimony from transgender Utahns and parents of transgender kids urging lawmakers not to restrict their ability to access life-saving care for an already vulnerable group of people who are at higher risk of suicide.

“I believe in personal responsibility, parental authority, and limited government. This bill violates all three,” said Catherine Dillon. “Please don’t make our family collateral damage in politics.”
Dillon said she is a mother of a 16-year-old transgender daughter who is currently “grandfathered” in under Utah’s current moratorium on gender-affirming hormonal care because she had already started treatments before lawmakers enacted the 2023 moratorium. 
An estimated 135 transgender kids in Utah were undergoing treatment when Utah’s moratorium went into effect. Some have aged out since then, but Dillon said Shipp’s bill would require treatment to end for less than 100, “and my daughter is one of them.” 
She held up a photo of her daughter for lawmakers to see. 
“She has a bright future and knows exactly who she is. I’m not asking you to understand my daughter’s identity, only to understand that this law won’t change it, and it will harm her,” she said. “This bill does not protect children. … This bill only pushes care underground, out of state and out of reach.” 
Turning Utah’s moratorium on transgender care for kids into a ban
If approved by the full Utah Legislature, HB174 would ban health care providers from prescribing hormonal transgender treatments to all minor patients, including requiring current patients to stop their treatment by Jan. 28 next year.  
Before the committee voted to favorably recommend the bill and advance it to the full Republican-controlled House, Veronika DaVil, a drag artist who has organized transgender rights rallies on Utah’s Capitol Hill, shouted while storming out of the committee room. 
“We have all had people take their lives because of this body,” DaVil yelled. “Do better. Love one another.”

The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Rex Shipp, R-Cedar City, responded “I don’t hate anybody” — a comment that several in the packed committee room laughed and scoffed at while shaking their heads. 
“This is about protecting the most vulnerable, which is our children,” Shipp said. 
Shipp and the bills’ supporters argued that kids shouldn’t be given hormonal treatments that could result in “irreversible physical harm.” Much of Shipp’s bill presentation focused on discrediting the state’s own academic research on the safety and effectiveness of hormonal gender-affirming treatments for minors. 
When Utah lawmakers enacted the moratorium in 2023, they required the Utah Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a “systematic review of the medical evidence” of the use of hormonal treatments for transgender minors under the age of 18 with gender dysphoria. 
Anti-transgender bill among ‘most harmful and outrageous’ Utah LGBTQ+ advocates have seen

That systematic review — conducted by the University of Utah College of Pharmacy’s Drug Regimen Review Center and submitted to state officials in August 2024 — cost about $110,000 to analyze more than 277 studies of at least 28,056 pediatric gender dysphoria patients from “all over the world.” 
“The conventional wisdom among non-experts has long been that there are limited data on the use of (gender-affirming hormone therapy) in pediatric patients with (gender dysphoria),” the evidence review report says. “However, results from our exhaustive literature searches have led us to the opposite conclusion.” 
After “many months” of reviewing available literature, “it was impossible for us to avoid drawing some high-level conclusions,” the report says. “Namely, the consensus of the evidence supports that the treatments are effective in terms of mental health, psychosocial outcomes, and the induction of body changes consistent with the affirmed gender in pediatric (gender dysphoria) patients.”
The review also said evidence supports that “treatments are safe in terms of changes to bone density, cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic changes, and cancer.” 
But Shipp called the state’s own review a “flawed report with a lot of bias in it.” 
Among those that argued in favor of his bill while expressing “major concerns” with the state’s academic review was Kurt Miceli, a physician and chief medical officer for Do No Harm. The group advocates for “keeping identity politics out of medical education, research and clinical practice,” and opposes “youth-focused gender ideology,” according to its website.

Miceli argued Utah lawmakers should instead look to a review that was issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in May, which highlights “a growing body of evidence pointing to significant risks including irreversible harms such as infertility — while finding very weak evidence of benefit.”
In a peer review of that report, the American Psychiatric Association said that while the HHS report “purports to be a thorough, evidence-based assessment of gender-affirming care for transgender youth, its underlying methodology lacks sufficient transparency and clarity for its findings to be taken at face value” and its claims “fall short of the standard of methodological rigor that should be considered a prerequisite for policy guidance in clinical care.” 
Caught in the middle of the disagreements over the scientific evidence are a small number of Utah kids that haven’t yet aged out of Utah’s moratorium and are currently undergoing treatment.

Heather Kester, of Eagle Mountain, said she’s the mother of a transgender teenager who was also “grandfathered” in to continue treatments after Utah’s moratorium took effect. Kester said her daughter was 13 years old when she “attempted suicide due to gender dysphoria.” 
After years of “careful, multidisciplinary care,” including therapy “before even entertaining the idea” of hormone treatments, Kester said her daughter received “life-saving care” and was eventually prescribed hormone therapy and puberty blockers. 
“She is currently alive, thriving, happy, back in public school and looking into her future,” she said. 
To those who support Shipp’s bill out of concerns of permanent impacts to kids’ bodies from the medications, Kester said: “My child is alive today because of them.” 
“And if we have to deal with bone density issues, I will, because she’s alive,” Kester said. “It’s better than having a dead child. And that is a reality that our family has faced.”  
Ban backed by House speaker
Shipp’s bill has been prioritized by House Republican leadership and is supported by House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper. Schultz told Utah News Dispatch in an interview earlier this month that he wants to make the state’s moratorium a permanent ban. 
“For a couple of years as this issue first came up I was kind of on the fence because I could see both sides of it,” Schultz said, but now he argued “we’ve got a lot of studies, in particular the ones coming out of Sweden, that show the long-term harms.”

Asked about Utah’s study that showed hormonal treatments for minors are largely safe and effective, Schultz said he was “really disappointed in Utah’s study, to be honest with you.” He argued it didn’t include enough research on long-term harm. 
“I don’t need a study to tell me common sense,” he added. “And I firmly believe in that. … Kids shouldn’t be taking hormone blockers, puberty blockers. It shouldn’t happen.” 
House Minority Whip Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, was among three Democrats who voted against Shipp’s bill Tuesday. She said she was “emotionally exhausted” by another batch of bills “targeting” transgender people in Utah. 
“There seems to be this dogged desire to continue to marginalize one of our most marginalized, at-risk populations,” she said. “To our transgender community, I stand with you. I always will, and I love you. … I’m really, really sorry that we have to constantly drag you up here to bare your souls and tell your stories and ask for compassion when I know that you’re not going to get it.” 
Dailey-Provost added that she’s “ashamed when scientists use misdirection and their education to tell a story that they want to be true, whether it is or not.” 
She added that “nobody claims that gender-affirming care is without risk.”

“Every medical care that every patient receives has risk,” she said, “but we’re not here denying that to anyone else.” 
Before casting her vote in favor of Shipp’s bill, Rep. Cheryl Acton, R-West Jordan, told Utah’s transgender community: “I love you too.” 
“I will be voting for this bill because I simultaneously recognize your humanity … at the same time, I have a desire to protect children from irreversible harms. That’s what this bill is about,” she said. “I fully support adults making decisions and living their lives. But when children … are brought into the equation, that’s where I have to decide.” 
Banning public-funded insurance coverage for transgender care
After Shipp’s bill passed out of Tuesday’s committee, the next two bills lawmakers advanced to the House floor were both sponsored by Rep. Nicholeen Peck, R-Tooele.
HB193 would ban government entities from using public funds to pay for insurance coverage for transgender employees who receive hormonal treatments or sex characteristic surgical procedures. 
“The distinction in this bill is really about if it’s transgender procedure related as opposed just to any type of hormonal (treatment) or any other reason,” Peck said. “The point of this bill really is about the use of taxpayer dollars and prioritizing that.” 
Kaz Kanani Howell, of Salt Lake City, urged lawmakers not to support Peck’s bill. 
“Denying trans people access to life-saving medicine and health care will not make us less trans or cisgender,” they said. “You would make living a joyful life extremely harder to access. As a trans person of color, as a trans Utahn, as an American, I feel that I have three unalienable rights: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”

Before it won approval from the committee, the bill was changed to allow people who are currently receiving hormonal transgender treatment to “complete that course of treatment” beyond the bill’s effective date, on May 6, under their current coverage if their physician determines it is medically necessary. 
Additionally, the bill requires governmental employers to provide insurance for people seeking care to “detransition.” 
The committee also endorsed Peck’s second bill, HB258, which would also require private insurers to cover “detransition” treatment and procedures if they’ve previously paid for transgender treatments. 
Peck argued there’s a “growing” population of transgender people who want to reverse their treatments, and she wants to ensure it’s available for people who want it. 
“In short, we’re just trying to make sure that all people are represented by their private insurance companies,” Peck said. 
Most arguments against Peck’s bills were directed at her proposal to restrict government entities from covering gender-affirming care for transgender Utahns. 
Marina Lowe, legislative counsel for Equality Utah, the state’s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, argued against the bill while noting that Utah lawmakers have spent five years in a row debating legislation aimed at restricting transgender Utahns. 
“I just want to remind everyone that transgender Utahns exist,” she said. “They deserve the same rights and dignity that all Americans deserve, and that extends to health care as well.” 
Lowe also argued “all Utahns should be worried when the Legislature steps in between that sacred relationship between a doctor and a patient and dictates what sort of medications and procedures” can be administered.
One Republican, Rep. Ray Ward, of Bountiful, joined Democrats in voting against Peck’s HB193. He argued there “are a fairly large number of other cisgender hormone treatments” that are covered.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives Tuesday approved a bill that would allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty for those convicted of sexual assault of a child under the age of 12. 
HB 41, sponsored by Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, passed the chamber after a lengthy and sometimes testy debate in which Democrats said the move could retraumatize victims or put them in physical harm and questioned the constitutionality of the legislation. 
Simpson, a former child crimes prosecutor, said the bill was part of a broader national effort to overturn Kennedy v. Louisiana, a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that prohibited capital punishment for child rape.

“I think the worst of the worst offenses is taking the innocence of a child and what these people do again. I’ve seen it,” Simpson said Tuesday. “I’ve seen how it affects these children to go through from this young and even younger. If it costs us the state of Alabama to stand up for others, to make sure that victims have the right to seek justice against what they’ve done. It’s worth it.”
Simpson cited a Bibb County child sex trafficking ring incident from last year as his reasoning for pushing the bill again this year. Last year, the bill passed in the House but did not make it to the Senate floor. Simpson argued that the Kennedy decision opened the door for the death penalty to be applied to child sexual assault if many states enacted it. Florida enacted the statute in 2023; last November, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said he would seek the death penalty for a 36-year-old indicted for raping multiple young children. 
“Let’s say Florida has that first charge [by the Supreme Court], and they can go up, and then they’re arguing in their brief that it’s no longer unusual, because this many states have it right now, it’s currently five, if it goes to six with us, with Alabama, and that snowballs into more,” he said after the bill passed.
House Democrats, however, were unconvinced. 
“We continuously pass bills here that we know are unconstitutional, and then we have to later defend this and to lend taxpayers money to defend these unconstitutional bills,” Rep. Penni McClammy, D-Montgomery, said during debate. 
House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville, agreed that child sexual assault should be punished to the fullest extent of the law, but said the punishment should be “life without parole.” 
“And so I think we agree that there should be a very stiff and aggressive punishment,” he said. “However, I think that given that cases that have been brought before the Supreme Court that deals with this issue has been ruled unconstitutional.”
Simpson said he didn’t see a difference between life without parole and death penalty.
“Currently the law is under the age of six, it’s life without the possibility of parole, which is behind bars. They will not get out of bars. They leave prison in a casket, which is what this bill does, too,” Simpson said.
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, also had concerns about interpersonal relationships between victims and their abuser, and that the possibility of the death penalty could make them less likely to cooperate with the prosecutors. 
“It could be the father, could be the mother, the aunt, the uncle, the coach, the pastor, the Boy Scout troop leader, somebody that the victim actually loves and trusts,” England said. “I mean, it’s less likely that The victim will come forward and participate in that prosecution, and it’s just my opinion. And for me, this isn’t executing the defendant and killing the defendant, to me, is not nearly as important as what’s left of the victim’s life after being abused.”
Writing for the Supreme Court majority in Kennedy v. Louisiana in 2008, Justice Anthony Kennedy raised similar concerns, and also said the chance of death might encourage an abuser to kill his or her victim. Kennedy also noted that in the Louisiana case that came to them, the victim was forced to testify multiple times, leading to trauma. 
“During formative years of her adolescence, made all the more daunting for having to come to terms with the brutality of her experience, (the victim) was required to discuss the case at length with law enforcement personnel,” Kennedy wrote. 
While speaking to Daniels, Simpson said the Supreme Court has been wrong multiple times throughout history.
“I think you’d agree with me that the Supreme Court was wrong and the worst decision they ever made was the Dred Scott decision,” Simpson said. “I think you’d agree with me that the Supreme Court was wrong in the Plessy v. Ferguson separate but equal decision. And what we’re going through is we have to show the Supreme Court gets cases wrong,”
Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said Thursday after the Senate’s meeting that he’s in support of the bill but wants legislators to take their time considering it.
“I don’t think something of that nature needs to be fast tracked, but I do think, as we go through that particular bill and the consequences of that particular bill, people need to know exactly what they’re voting on so they can vote their conscience,” he said.
The House also passed HB 11, sponsored by Phillip Pettus, R-Killen, that would prohibit judges from extending youthful offender status to individuals that are 16 years of age or older.
“It started off in Dadeville, where the kids went in and shot up the birthday party, and every one of them applied for youthful offender after killing several people,” Pettus said about the bill’s origins.
The bill passed 102-0. Pettus sponsored a similar bill during the 2025 legislative session.

(Photo: Getty Images)Last year, the Nevada Attorney for Injured Workers (NAIW) agency, which has nine attorneys in Las Vegas, four attorneys in Carson City, and 20 secretaries and legal researchers, took on around 650 cases.
But NAIW, which operates within the state Department of Business and Industry, has the capacity to take on even more, according to administrator Maria Atkinson. “In a year, we can take up anywhere from 600 to over 1,000 cases.”
“Many claims are denied because people just didn’t follow the right steps and adhere to the right deadlines in order to get things done,” Atkinson added.
An injured worker has 70 days to appeal to the hearing division when their claim is initially denied, or if only part of the claim was accepted. They can do so by sending the initial claim denial letter from the insurer and by filling out a hearing request form.
At the hearing division level “the worker can represent themselves or they can show up with private counsel,” Atkinson said. At this level, injured workers are not eligible for NAIW’s representation.
About 10 days after meeting with the hearing division, the worker receives a written decision in the mail. If the worker disagrees with any part of the decision, they can further appeal it to the appeals officer by submitting a form within 30 days of the hearing division’s decision.
On that form, the injured worker can indicate that they opt to use NAIW’s free representation.
But, since many Nevada workers are unaware of the agency, they choose private counsel for representation and forfeit a portion of their claim earnings, if they win, to attorney fees.
NAIW won all 10 of its appeal cases to the Nevada District and Supreme courts in 2025, but lack of public knowledge about their services leaves the agency underutilized, Atkinson told state lawmakers during a legislative Interim Committee on Commerce and Labor meeting last week.
During the meeting, Republican state Sen. John Ellison raised the point of workers being told that they’re going to get “all this money” but that “the attorneys get most of it.” 
“I believe in private enterprise but sometimes it goes a little too far,” Ellison concluded.
Atkinson emphasized that private counsel is important in the legal landscape of Nevada, but also highlighted the importance of having a state-run alternative that’s free.
“Private practice is still a revenue-based business. They don’t work for free,” she said. “So at some point, the employee still is entitled to benefits, but they might not be benefits that a private law firm can really take fees from.”
The lack of private practice availability in 1977 was part of the reason why the agency was created in the first place.
“It was determined that there was an injustice to workers in the state of Nevada being left to lurk with no basis of private attorneys to represent them,” Atkinson said. Instead of workers having to fend for themselves with paperwork and deadlines, the state stepped in. “The agency was created in order to assist these workers.”
Nevada’s entire workers’ compensation system is funded through employer-paid premiums and insurer-paid assessments, which go to the Division of Industrial Relations to fund the Department of Administration Hearings Division and NAIW.
“The taxpayers aren’t paying us,” Atkinson said. “It’s the employers and the people doing business here in workers’ comp that are actually paying for this agency to run and for us to help injured workers.”
Atkinson was appointed as the administrator of NAIW in July of last year after working in private practice for over 20 years. 
“I decided that I want to do government work. That I want to help people and not be tapping on doors saying ‘numbers are due,’” she said. “It was a good landing being here now.”
In the last fiscal year, NAIW represented 654 compensation cases with 346 decision and settlement wins, a 53% win percentage.
“It’s a pretty damn good score when we don’t get to pick our cases. Private practice should have close to 100% of wins because they get to pick and choose which cases they take forward,” Atkinson said. 
But sometimes, she noted, it’s about the fight and not necessarily the win.
“We will be there for them regardless,” Atkinson continued, “to win 50% of cases that nobody wanted or gave up on is not a bad score at all.”
Part of NAIW’s purpose is to provide procedural advice and general information about the workers’ compensation system to the public. The agency fielded 1,154 information calls from Nevadans last fiscal year.
“There’s a huge need for our constituents to understand that our services are available to them for procedural assistance so that they don’t create other roadblocks that we won’t be able to get past by the time they get to our offices,” Atkinson told state lawmakers during the interim committee meeting last week.“People call us when they get letters from insurance companies with questions and we help them understand what forms they need to get a hold of so that they can appeal letters they disagree with,” Atkinson explained. “At that stage, all we’re doing is giving them procedural information with no legal advice.” 
Workman’s compensation claims became a focus point of the November special session with the introduction and passage of Senate Bill 7, which allows first responders to get medical coverage for health issues after years on the job. 
Republican state Sen. John Steinbeck, a retired Clark County fire chief, asked Atkinson about workers’ compensation cases by firefighters and police officers from exposure on the job being “consistently denied” initially then “consistently won” during the appeal process.
NAIW rarely sees those cases, Atkinsons responded, as they are usually represented by private counsel, but has done so in the past.
She noted a case of NAIW representing the widow of a Reno police officer that died from heart disease. The case went to the Nevada Supreme Court where the claimant was awarded workers’ compensation benefits. 
Atkinson hopes the agency can better market itself as a resource for injured workers.
She plans to attend a few events at the William S. Boyd School of Law at UNLV to promote the work that NAIW does to law students.
“I want to talk to them and let them know that this agency exists, this work exists and it is a great place to help,” she said. “I’m a native Nevadan, born and raised here, and take this work to heart. I want Nevada to succeed in every way and that includes helping the people here, especially our injured workers.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2235040200-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 08:57:41.290722

Jan. 27, 2026 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceDETROIT – Restoring worker power is becoming a focal point in Abdul El-Sayed’s campaign for the U.S. Senate, and he tapped one of Michigan’s stalwart labor figures — former U.S. Rep. Andy Levin — to help convey a new policy platform centered on ending exploitation.
El-Sayed, who is seeking the Democratic nomination along with U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), on Tuesday morning released a five-point labor policy agenda that he said would also strengthen collective bargaining and would help rebuild the nation’s economy in a way that works for everyone, not just a wealthy few.
The candidate said he would demand strong antitrust enforcement and empower the Federal Trade Commission to stop harmful consolidation to protect wages, working conditions, and union contracts; ban corporate stock buybacks by repealing SEC Rule 10b-18, ensuring corporations invest in workers rather than executive bonuses; mandate employee-elected board representation for publicly-traded companies; and protect retirement security, especially multi-employer pensions, by defending the Butch Lewis Act and supporting the Protecting Employees and Retirees in Business Bankruptcies Act.
El-Sayed added that guaranteeing health care for every American through Medicare for All, so unions and their members can choose between bargaining for higher wages or add-on health insurance, was also imperative to envision a more labor-friendly nation.
On Tuesday evening, El-Sayed hit those points home in a town hall featuring Levin in Detroit at Wayne County Community College. It was there that the candidate also shared his belief that the labor movement can teach important lessons on how to fight tyranny and state-sponsored violence against American citizens, much like what has been playing out in Minneapolis with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents.
Balancing domestic production with the right to unionize
One attendee at the town hall noted that decades ago, executives started pushing production offshore with the promise of lower prices, but those actions left the American worker behind. El-Sayed was asked about what he would do to ensure that domestic production of goods and services returns while also ensuring that workers have the right to choose their working conditions, and to have the best conditions possible.
El-Sayed responded by saying that in the mid- to late-20th Century, the ratio between what CEOs made and what workers made was more relative, but the U.S. wasn’t nearly as permissive about global trade contracts. By proxy, there was also higher union membership and with it a productive economy.
Global trade agreements that left workers behind, much like NAFTA, President Donald Trump’s rewrite of that agreement as the USMCA, and the Trans Pacific Partnership, spelled disaster for the American worker, he said.
“I think they’ve been a bit of a cancer on the American economy,” El-Sayed added. “We make a deal with the devil, and then we watch as our jobs get offshore, engineers abroad copy out (expletive), and then make it without any protections for workers in their community, and then sell it back to ours. And we’re supposed to get real excited because we can get a big screen TV for less. … I remember when you are able to afford what you needed, with one job, a union job, in this country making stuff.”
Those trade policies, however, have made that harder and El-Sayed said his solution would be to protect unions and their power to bargain, but also to use tariffs wisely — and not the way Trump has.
“If NAFTA and these trade deals are cancer, you need some chemotherapy,” he said. “A bit of chemo targeted with a very clear goal can save your life, but as any doctor here will tell you, if you give the patient all the chemo all at the same time, you’re going to kill your patient. There are ways for us to be thinking about how we target the industries of the future: Use very specific tariff regimes to protect those industries, assure that companies that get the early investment are ones that dignify their workers.”
Banning corporate stock buybacks, board representation for employees and Right to Work
One way to dignify workers, aside from living wages with great working conditions, was to ensure employees have a say on the boards of the companies they work for. That could help, El-Sayed said, to prevent boards from making decisions that only boost their bottom lines or maximize their stock prices.
Another hedge against corporations making decisions only for fiduciary gains would be to ban stock buybacks entirely. El-Sayed said he believes stock buybacks should be illegal for publicly-traded companies.
Although El-Sayed is running for a national office, he was asked a question about the governor’s race from a newly unionized work at Corewell Health. She worried about a Republican taking the governor’s office this year and reinstating Right to Work laws, which stymied union membership and strength. 
El-Sayed said he was also worried about that scenario, especially given the Republican caucus that currently controls the state House under the leadership of Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township).
“That is a fear that all of us ought to have,” El-Sayed said. “Especially considering the way that this Legislature is operating and this speaker is operating. They are craven, they’re willing to go back on deals that they strike, and this has been the number one goal that they, on the behalf of their corporate overlords, have been wanting for a very long time.”
The candidate added that he thought the Legislature should preempt state labor law and that it should be illegal to have any sort of Right to Work across the country.
El Sayed’s opponents for the nomination have also outlined strong support for organized labor, with McMorrow having already rolled out a “Labor and Workforce Agenda” that prioritizes investment in certified apprenticeship and training programs, while Stevens has long touted her role as the chief of staff on former President Barack Obama’s automotive industry rescue effort and in September introduced legislation designed to “protect union jobs” and “strengthen labor standards”.
Call to abolish ICE takes personal tone
The situation in Minneapolis was now personal for El-Sayed because he said traveled there recently to see what the federal government’s enforcement looked like on the ground. He talked about what it was like seeing citizen patrols use whistles to highlight incoming raids, and how the situation has gotten so out of control.

“I want to tell you what it sounded like,” he said. “Imagine you’re at soccer practice … and you’ve heard that whistle … normally alongside children laughing. It’s a sound of joy. In Minneapolis, that whistle isn’t about joy.”
He said Renee Good and Alex Pretti, two Minneapolis residents who were killed by ICE and Border Patrol agents in the act of protesting their actions, were courageous and lost their lives because they were simply documenting the chaos.
“I worked with people like Alex. … This is a guy who worked at the VA taking care of people who were sworn to protect and serve our Constitution,” El-Sayed said. “He died protecting and serving our Constitution by holding accountable a military force that is being weaponized against that Constitution in our peaceful streets.”
He said the time was now to do something that he advocated for since running for the governor’s office in 2018: It was time to finally abolish ICE.
The candidate acknowledged that the town hall was about labor, but his call to dismantle the agency had much to do with standing in solidarity as unions do each day.
“They expect that the majority of us will be quiet and slink into the background, but in solidarity, there is faith,” he said. “If we’re serious about protecting our Constitution, it’s going to require us to learn the lesson that the union movement has been teaching us for a very long time. When we stand up together, we protect the most important things, and it’s going to take the same courage to face down what is ugly if we’re protecting the dignity of workers and protecting the dignity of our Constitution.”
“That fight is one in the same,” El-Sayed said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-055852-1024x570.png,,,2026-01-28 08:57:41.290722

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)
Lawmakers behind the push for a local immigrant detention center ban amended their bill Tuesday to also prohibit police and sheriff’s deputies statewide from entering agreements to send immigrants in local jails to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. 
House Bill 9, aka the Immigrant Safety Act, cleared its first committee after contentious debate last week. The bill now has an amendment that would ban agreements between ICE and local law enforcement — often called “287(g) agreements” after the relevant section in federal immigration law — that authorize local law enforcement to serve ICE warrants on arrestees held in local jails. 
The agreements require any immigrant who is served one of those warrants to be transferred to an immigrant detention facility within 48 hours. Only one New Mexico county, Curry County, has such an agreement with ICE, according to an ICE database.
New Mexico Rep. Eleanor Chavez, a co-sponsor of HB9, told Source New Mexico on Tuesday evening that the amendment is necessary to “keep the community safe” from ICE, especially given what the agency is doing in Minnesota. 
“We want to create a situation where it’s consistent throughout the state, where public identities are not cooperating with ICE enforcement,” she said. “It’s really plain and simple.”
According to recent data from the Deportation Data Project, three New Mexico ICE arrests occurred through the use of 287(g) agreements. The data shows the arrests occurred between August and October of last year and involved detainees who had not been convicted of a crime. 
The data as of mid-December, which researchers obtain periodically via public records requests to ICE, notes that two of the detainees were still in ICE custody at that time. A third voluntarily left the country to Mexico.
Curry County Sheriff Michael Brockett previously told Source in an email that maintaining agreements with federal law enforcement was important for public safety. 
“As conservators of the peace, we must maintain these strong relationships, as keeping our communities safe is a team effort,” he said in a statement last June. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham authorized the Legislature to take up HB9 during the 30-day session, one of the measures that lawmakers can consider and pass in a session otherwise dedicated to budgetary matters. 
But the governor’s office has not said publicly whether she supports the Legislature also addressing 287(g) agreements this session. Her Jan. 20 message to the House of Representatives, which details the legislation she’s authorizing the Legislature to consider, does not mention 287(g) agreements.
Source asked the governor’s Communications Director Michael Coleman two weeks ago in an email about whether both measures would be up for debate and passage this session. Coleman confirmed Jan. 14 that the immigration detention ban would be, but he said he was still waiting on an answer then about the 287(g) agreements.
Coleman did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to Source’s question about the amendment.
But Chavez said Tuesday she thinks the amendment will also be on the governor’s call for the session, based on recent conversations sponsors have had with her office. 
The bill is scheduled for a hearing Thursday afternoon in the House Judiciary Committee. Chavez predicted another long debate about the bill and the amendment. 
“I’m sure there will be lots of questions about it tomorrow during the hearing,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Immigration-stock-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 07:57:40.662291

Sign up here.

For decades, Bridgeport’s public housing developments — P.T. Barnum Apartments, Trumbull Gardens, and Charles F. Greene Homes — have stood as symbols of both failed housing policy and the unshakable resilience of the people who call them home. Their stories stretch beyond concrete and brick, past peeling paint and patchwork repairs, into something harder to measure: the slow, collective work of residents who are tired of waiting for someone else to fix what’s broken.

When Vanessa Liles, co project director at PT Partners, walks through the courtyards of P.T. Barnum Apartments, residents recognize her, wave at her and know that there’s someone that has their back. Liles leads PT Partners, a resident-led, grassroots nonprofit that operates right inside this community. “People here have lived through generations of neglect,” she says. “But they’re also the ones who have the answers. We just help them build the structure to make those answers heard. 
“This is about giving residents the tools to advocate for themselves,” she said.
The 18 buildings that make up P.T. Barnum were built in 1946. Red brick rowhouses on the edge of the Black Rock neighborhood, overlooking Bridgeport Harbor. Most are two or three-bedroom units, stacked closely together, connected by narrow walkways and exterior stairs. There are no elevators, the buildings show visible signs of aging and maintenance challenges. For many, this is the only home they’ve ever known. For others, it’s a place to rebuild.
For years, P.T. Barnum was a shorthand for everything wrong with public housing: underfunded, overpoliced, and forgotten. But inside, the story has always been more complicated. “We call this community resilient for a reason,” says Liles. “People are organizing, building leadership teams, translating documents so everyone can participate, and sitting across the table from housing officials to hold them accountable. That’s not hopelessness. That’s power.”
When Jillian Baldwin took over as CEO of Park City Communities, Bridgeport’s housing authority, Baldwin inherited a backlog of more than $70 million in capital repairs. “If we’re one of the longest-standing troubled housing authorities in the nation, that means there’s a lot of pain and trauma in communication with residents,” she says. “We try to validate that experience, but at some point, we have to come together and work through it.”
Baldwin’s tenure has brought measurable change. Since 2022, Park City Communities has invested more than $42 million in capital improvements: new roofs, windows, elevators, and community spaces. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development inspection scores have jumped dramatically. Trumbull Gardens, once rated 37, now stands at 76. P.T. Barnum rose from 41 to 78. Greene Homes, near the downtown, went from 45 to 85. Those numbers, Baldwin insists, aren’t just about construction. “You don’t get a $20 million improvement without being plugged into residents,” she says. “They know what needs to be done.”
At Greene Homes, a cluster of seven-story towers built in 1951, longtime resident Desiree Gonzalez has seen the change firsthand. “It started off with a lot of drama… shootings, needles, drug dealers,” she recalls. “It was violent. But now, it’s calmer.” She points to the little things: elevators that work more often, benches and swings for the kids, events that bring families together. “The housing does events for us to come together,” she says. “It’s nice to speak about what we need.”
Still, Gonzalez worries about the elderly neighbors who live on upper floors. “They should be downstairs,” she says. “It’d be safer. It’s hard for them.” Her words echo a larger truth: progress can be uneven. 
Residents like Nilsa Heredia, who has lived at P.T. since 1970, have seen both sides. “Back in the old days, it was crazy,” she says. “Now it’s calmer. Kids can play safely outside.” Her neighbor, Evelyn Medina, agrees but adds that some trust has been lost. “We can’t trust the housing,” she says quietly. “They’re not helping people like they used to.”
For every repaired roof, there’s still a leak in another building waiting to be fixed. Safety remains a constant concern, residents said. Several people described incidents of gunfire near their buildings, with one resident recalling a bullet entering her apartment. Many said they no longer feel comfortable letting their children play in the on-site playgrounds, often choosing nearby parks instead.

Residents also cited ongoing frustrations with slow maintenance responses, broken elevators and overflowing dumpsters. Still, amid the challenges, many spoke about the sense of community that persists.
Liles sees this tension daily. Through PT Partners, she works with resident leaders to create systems of accountability. Holding monthly meetings between tenants and management, training on tenants’ rights, and outreach in multiple languages. “The system was never built for residents to lead,” she says. “It was built for compliance. What we’re doing is teaching people how to change that system from within.”
The organization’s model is built on “resident tables” — small groups of tenants who meet regularly to identify problems, propose solutions and push for systemic changes, from maintenance timelines to translation services. “One of the biggest barriers here is language,” Liles says. “We have residents who speak Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese. If you can’t understand the paperwork or the meetings, how can you participate in your own community?”
The organization’s approach has inspired similar organizing in other developments across Bridgeport. Trumbull Gardens, for instance, a sprawling mix of towers and townhouses built in 1952, now hosts monthly leadership meetings where residents talk directly with management. It’s a far cry from the days when residents said their calls and emails went unanswered. “We’ve had residents who used to be scared to speak up,” Liles says. “Now they’re running meetings, writing letters, and talking about budgets. That’s power that can’t be taken away.”
Still, organizing inside a public housing system that has seen decades of disinvestment isn’t easy. Liles says progress often comes in cycles. Small wins followed by new challenges. “We’re seeing improvements, yes. But the structural barriers, underfunding, bureaucratic delays, policies that treat housing as a privilege instead of a right; those things are still real. People are still living with mold, with rodents, with mental and physical health impacts from years of neglect.”
On a recent afternoon, Liles set up a table in the courtyard at P.T. Barnum Apartments, offering clothes, school supplies, snacks, and other essentials for families in the community. Parents stopped by with their children, picking up what they needed and chatting with neighbors. A volunteer stood nearby to translate for anyone who needed it — a small example, residents said, of how people in the community look out for one another.
“This is what community looks like,” Liles said. “We don’t have to wait for a new policy or a new director to care for one another. We’re already doing it.”
Baldwin, for her part, welcomes this kind of engagement. “We want residents to have a say in these decisions,” she says. “Everything is a trade-off — parking, green space, security. Residents are helping us decide what matters most.” 
That collaboration has led to new initiatives. From expanded security cameras and ShotSpotter technology to partnerships with local police. “We’ve applied for safety and security grants in every HUD round,” Baldwin says. “From 2023 to 2025, we’ve brought in $12.5 million for safety and development.”

But money and metrics can’t capture everything. Sharon Truman, better known as “Ms. Peaches” in the neighborhood, first moved into public housing in the 1960s, and believes the progress feels both real and incomplete. “We had a good life,” she says. “It was wonderful. But the young people now… they don’t respect no more.” She pauses, then smiles. “Still, I’m thankful and grateful for this place. I feel safe here. I’ve seen worse.”
Her gratitude speaks to a tension both Liles and Baldwin recognize between appreciation and exhaustion. Many residents worry about what’s next. Rumors of redevelopment, new voucher policies, and future demolitions create uncertainty.
City officials first announced plans in 2018 to demolish and rebuild the aging Charles F. Greene Homes, citing long-standing maintenance issues, sanitation concerns and crime, but the process has moved slowly as the housing authority worked to stabilize operations and secure funding. 
The redevelopment would follow the model used at former public housing sites like Marina Village and, decades earlier, Father Panik Village, which were torn down and replaced with mixed-income housing.
Baldwin doesn’t deny the fear. “Imagine if we tore down Greene Homes, P.T. Barnum, Trumbull Gardens,” she says. “Residents wouldn’t have anywhere to go. We’re making generational decisions for people’s housing resources.”
Liles argues that those decisions must start with residents themselves. “Too often, systems are designed around people instead of with them,” she says. “We’re changing that. Residents are co-designing the solutions now — not just reacting to decisions made behind closed doors.” 
Her push for systemic change isn’t just about policy; it’s about redefining what dignity looks like. “People think of public housing as a failure,” she says. “But what I see are people raising families, caring for neighbors, working, organizing, showing up. That’s community. That’s success.”
Across Bridgeport, that idea is beginning to take root. Residents are leading cleanups, organizing block parties, translating newsletters, and advocating for fair housing protections. “Everybody is going through something,” says Gonzalez, the Greene Homes resident. “But if we just take the time to understand someone before judging, we can all live better.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2024_0112_SR_PTBarnum_073-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-28 07:57:40.662291

(Photo by Kena Betancur/Getty Images)Seaside Heights officials appeared in a courtroom Tuesday to defend a local law banning 18- to 20-year-olds from renting hotels and motels during the after-prom season, saying they want to change the culture of the town that garnered national attention from MTV’s “Jersey Shore.”
Kevin Riordan, an attorney representing the Ocean County borough, said its governing body determined that prom celebrations there are “disturbing to the rest of the residents.”
‘They’re allowed to make that determination. They’re allowed to say, ‘Not in hotel rooms, go somewhere else,’” Riordan said. “There really is no right to rent a hotel room in Seaside Heights during prom season.”
A panel of three appellate judges heard arguments Tuesday from attorneys from both the town and hotels in Seaside Heights who are at odds over the ordinance, which bars adults under 21 from renting rooms in hotels and motels from April 15 to June 30 each year. Violations come with a $2,000 fine.
Town officials have argued that when the state legalized cannabis, the annual tradition of young adults heading down the shore to celebrate after proms became “an uncontrollable hazard up and down the coastline of New Jersey.” The ordinance was part of a package of local laws intended to “curtail the season of heightened teen disturbances,” they said, including a curfew for anyone under 18 years old.
A group of motels sued the town, arguing the ordinance violates the New Jersey Civil Rights Act and the Law Against Discrimination. A lower-court judge dismissed the complaint.
Christopher Ryan O’Shea, an attorney representing the motels, argued Tuesday to the appellate judges that excluding a specific class of people like young adults amounts to discrimination. O’Shea said the broad statute targets “obnoxious behavior” rather than criminal behavior.
If the ordinance really intended to curtail crime, he said, it makes “zero sense” that it ends before the Fourth of July, a holiday that attracts rowdy crowds to the beaches (the Seaside Heights police chief said there was a brawl there last summer).
O’Shea noted that Fort Dix is just about 40 miles west of Seaside Heights.
“Adults who are between the ages of 18 and 21, who have the same ability to go to war and contract their bodies away, should have the same ability to contract to rent a hotel room in Seaside Heights,” he said.
The ordinance, which allows for 18 to 20-year-olds to stay in short-term rentals with family members, created other legal problems, O’Shea said. A 21-year-old who is engaged to their 20-year-old partner would not be able to rent a room together in Seaside Heights, said O’Shea.
That had one judge questioning — what if two consenting adults want to “get a room?”
Riordan responded that young people can rent a house or can go elsewhere, like Belmar, Seaside Park, or Point Pleasant. He added that the ordinance is tailored directly to solving a specific problem: young people coming to Seaside Heights to celebrate the end of high school.
“I still remember how careless an individual I was after my prom. I’m lucky to still be alive, and there are a number of others who I think can make the same claim,” he said. “All we’re doing is trying to address a problem with prom behavior.”
It’s not clear when the judge will issue a decision.

Jeana Ross, R-Guntersville, speaks to a colleague in the Alabama House of Representatives on Jan. 27, 2026 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector) The Alabama House of Representatives Tuesday passed a bill that would prohibit excessive screen time for children up to five years old.
HB 78, sponsored by Rep. Jeana Ross, R-Guntersville, passed the chamber 101-1. Rep. Mary Moore, D-Birmingham, was the sole no vote.
“When I was in public schools and I wrote grants, I was maybe in the early 2000s I wanted every child to have an iPad,” Ross said Tuesday. “Well, we’ve learned since then that children that learn to read on the screen are missing a lot of the comprehension skills that they would normally have. They end up scanning instead of reading from left to right. They end up reading in a Z pattern. So it is important that children do have that paper and pencil in print, that they can actually hold and absorb themselves.”
Under the bill, the Department of Early Childhood Education, Alabama State Department of Education and Department of Human Resources would collaborate on creative guidelines for appropriate screen time usage. Licensed child-care facilities, public kindergarten classrooms and specific Pre-K classrooms would be required to implement training and guidelines on screen time.
Rep. Jamie Kiel, R-Russelville, said he supports the bill but wishes legislation wasn’t the way for action to be taken.
“I am disappointed that our educators are not making these decisions,” he said. “It’s not just this bill, it’s things like that we’ve have had to pass, like the cell phone bill, Literacy Act, all those type things that our State Board of Education, our early childhood department, all those people who are responsible for our children, boards of education on down, I believe they should be making those decisions, and why they’re not is beyond me.”
Messages seeking comment were left with ALSDE and ADECE Tuesday.
Currently, under the Alabama Administrative Code, children under two in child care facilities are prohibited from screen usage and children over two in half day programs are limited to 30 minutes per day and less than one hour in licensed facilities.
Moore raised concerns about how the bill would be implemented in schools that only do instruction time with screens.
“Everything that the teachers are teaching they’re learning from a computer screen. So what I understood after I realized in so many grade levels that’s the way we’re teaching, because the cost of purchasing books had just gotten to be so outlandish, and the state was not allocating enough funds per year,” she said.
Rep. Pebblin Warren, D-Tuskegee, said one of the main obstacles to this bill is parents.
“You will see an 18-month old baby sitting in a carrier, start crying, and the mom is going to give him an iPad. Okay?” she said. “The iPads and the technology have become the number one babysitter. So it seems as though we’ve got to find ways of trying to deal with that.”
If passed, the legislation would go into effect Jan. 1. It moves to the Senate.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Jeana-Ross-Jan-27-2026-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 07:57:40.662291

(Photo by Getty Images)After more than a decade of failed attempts, supporters of amending Washington state law to allow for homegrown marijuana are growing frustrated, but not giving up.
They’re back at the Legislature this year, pushing lawmakers to make the change. They argue that homegrown cannabis would not put a significant dent in regulated retail marijuana sales and that state penalties for growing at home fall disproportionately on people of color. 
Law enforcement groups and cities are among those opposed, citing concerns about kids getting exposed to the drug and added burdens for local police. 
Senate Bill 6204 would allow adults 21 and over to grow up to six cannabis plants in their home. Two adults living together could grow up to 12 plants and households with three or more adults could grow up to 15. The Senate Labor and Commerce Committee held a hearing on the bill Monday.
The proposal marks the 11th year lawmakers have introduced legislation that would allow for home cultivation since Washington legalized recreational cannabis in 2012. 
Washington is one of only three states to have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, yet prohibit homegrown marijuana. When Colorado legalized recreational cannabis the same year as Washington, it also allowed for home cultivation. 
“I’m a veteran and I cannot see any reason that I can’t grow a few plants in my own house for my personal use,” Erik Johansen, resident of Tumwater, told the Senate committee. “There’s no children there.”
Some critics of the bill contend that the state would lose millions of dollars a year in tax revenue if consumers opted to grow marijuana at home instead of paying a 37% cannabis excise tax when buying products in stores. 
Advocates say that’s unlikely because growing cannabis is especially difficult. 
“We are not your competition. We’re your neighbors and your customers,” John Kingsbury, chair of the patient committee for the Cannabis Alliance, said during this week’s hearing.
“If you’re willing to make felons of your neighbors to protect a half a percent of your sales, then the promise of I-502 has gone terribly wrong,” added Kingsbury, referring to the ballot initiative that voters approved in 2012, legalizing recreational marijuana sales.
On average between 2013 and 2019 in Washington, Black people were five times more likely to be arrested for home growing than white people and Hispanic people were 2.4 times more likely, according to a 2022 report by the state’s Social Equity in Cannabis Task Force. 
Sen. Rebecca Saldaña, D-Seattle, the lead sponsor of the bill, pointed out that even if the smell disturbed homegrowers’ neighbors, it could be reported and handled by law enforcement. 
As written, people who don’t control the odor of their marijuana plants or who do have them in places that are visible to the public could face a class three civil infraction. Law enforcement could seize and destroy plants from a household growing more than the legal limit. 
The Liquor and Cannabis Board would not be involved in home grow regulation. 
James McMahan, policy director of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, said law enforcement would need a search warrant and probable cause to carry out a seizure. 
The association is opposed to the bill. “We are concerned about the continued normalization of marijuana to our young people,” said McMahan.
The Association of Washington Cities is also against it. “It creates a lot of burden on local law enforcement,” said Derrick Nunnally, the group’s government relations advocate. 
The bill prohibits cannabis cultivation for households seeking to foster children and in homes with family day care. There is no restriction for households with children. 
In places where marijuana businesses are banned, residents could not grow at home.
House Bill 2614, a companion bill, is scheduled for a hearing in the House Committee on Consumer Protection and Business on Jan. 30. Its prime sponsor is Rep. Shelley Kloba, D-Bothell.
“The legalization of home cultivated in Washington state is inevitable,” Kingsbury said. “My only hope is to live long enough to see it happen.”
“It would be disappointing if legalization just turned into corporate weed,” he added.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/pot-leaf.jpeg,,,2026-01-28 07:57:40.662291

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican Indiana senators on Tuesday approved a bill aimed at prohibiting transgender students at public K-12 schools and state universities from using restrooms or locker rooms that match their gender identity.
Provisions of Senate Bill 182 would require those schools and universities to designate multiple-person restrooms, locker rooms, and changing areas for use only by males or females based on their reproductive biology at birth. 
Supporters described the bill as helping protect the safety and privacy of women and girls, while opponents argued its restroom requirements would increase bullying of transgender youth and force transgender men into women’s restrooms.

Bill author Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, said during the Senate debate that the proposal allows “women to continue to have their private spaces.”
“We’re not singling anyone out. You can continue to identify any which way you want,” Brown said. “But if you’re born a male, you’re going to the male bathroom. Pretty simple. You’re born a female, going to the female bathroom.”
The Senate endorsed the bill in a 37-8 party-line vote, sending it to the House for consideration.
Protesters denounce bill
About a dozen transgender-rights supporters gathered outside the Senate chamber ahead of the vote and argued that the bill would lead to more harassment of transgender people.
Emma Vosicky, the executive director of GenderNexus, criticized provisions that would allow anyone “who is directly or indirectly injured” by an alleged violation of the restroom restrictions to file a lawsuit against the school.
“The opportunity for the bounty is just going to feed the desire for some people to think that they are the gender police, which means anybody who’s dressed in a way that doesn’t perfectly conform with what our social structure says,” Vosicky said.
The new proposal follows state legislation approved in recent years limiting transgender medical procedures for those younger than 18 and prohibiting transgender youths from taking part in girls school sports teams.
Republican Gov. Mike Braun also issued an executive order last year prohibiting what he called “modern gender ideology” by state agencies.
The bill also toughens the restrictions on changing the sex designation on a birth certificate. It would limit such changes to a “medically verifiable genetic or physiological disorder of sex development.” 
Restroom impact debated 
Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, argued against the bill, saying its requirements would force transgender men, often with beards and other masculine features, into women’s restrooms.

Yoder said the bill encourages “a vigilante culture that targets everyone.”
“It’s an invitation for strangers to police the bodies of everyone, including women who are not transgender,” she said. “By mandating these bans, the state is encouraging a culture of harassment.”
Erica O’Connell, an attorney with the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom, testified in support of the bill last week, arguing that someone’s sex should not be based on a “person’s subjective sense of gender identity.”
“Women and young girls deserve to have their privacy and dignity safeguarded in the spaces where they are most vulnerable,” O’Connell said.
Andre Hardy was among those who protested against the bill on Tuesday.
“I’m a transgender man, and I do not belong in the women’s restroom,” Hardy said. “I do not want to be in the women’s restroom.”
Hardy said he could face situations of not being allowed to use a men’s restroom: “I deserve the human right to use the bathroom.”

(Getty Images)In October the World Food Championships were hosted in Indianapolis. The international contest brought chefs from over 40 countries from around the world to compete across a variety of categories. Several chefs from Indianapolis were crowned international champions. 
The most notable world champion was Emma Boyd. Emma is an 8th grader and a junior chef member of Team Indiana. Emma’s love of all things cooking started at home but was further developed and fostered by an after school program called the Junior Chef Academy. The program is run by an Indianapolis based non-profit to support urban youth to better understand nutrition and foster aspiring culinary artists. 
With the 2026 legislative nearing the midpoint, issues around the health and nutrition of Indiana children have begun to bubble up. We are beginning to see the policy initiatives of Make Indiana Healthy Again, and Hoosier kids are on track to be direct beneficiaries of these efforts. 
House Bill 1137, authored by Rep. Julie McGuire, directly addresses the nutrition, or lack thereof, in the food served by Indiana schools. While school lunches may seem to be a minor issue in the overall health of children, the reality is that it could be the place where we can show the most substantive change in chronic disease and obesity rates for the next generation. 
All children are required to attend school for over 1,400 hours a year, over 18 years, making it the number one place where children spend their time. Schools across the state offer both breakfast and lunch daily. On average, a child in Indiana will consume just under 400 meals annually at school, accounting for close to half of their annual food consumption.
Proposal would ban certain food dyes and preservatives from Indiana school lunches

 
For children in poverty, school meals can account for up to 70% of their total food consumption. There’s also evidence that school lunch can have a direct impact on children’s lifelong food preferences. HB 1137 attempts to leverage schools as the access point to begin to address the nutrition issues of Hoosier children. While schools are not mandated to ensure the health and nutrition of children, it is an issue that inevitably lands in their laps. 
“Common sense tells us there’s a clear connection between health and education,” said Sen. Tyler Johnson, an ER doctor by training.
While the mission and intent of both education and health revolve around the common good, connecting efforts and the impact of both is more elusive. As we consider ways to make Indiana kids healthy again, the school lunch piece of HB 1137 could prove to be just what we need to begin to show impact in health and education metrics. 
A study by Brookings found that free healthy school lunches had a positive and direct impact on math performance across all subgroups of students and dramatically reduced suspensions. While the research landscape around the academic impact of school lunches has ample opportunities to grow, the beauty of HB 1137 is that it specifically defines the ingredients that should no longer be served in Indiana schools based on national standards.  
The legislation specifically addresses and defines ultra-processed foods as containing one of 13 ingredients, from common food dyes to Potassium bromate and Butylated hydroxytoluene.
As with most big changes, the cost of a systemic change like this will be at the center of the debate. 
Currently, we spend roughly $194 million annually on free or reduced-price school meals as a country. The big concern about legislation like HB 1137 is that the cost of school meals could go up. According to Johnson, any initial increase in cost due to removing these chemicals from school meals will be offset by the reduced costs in combatting chronic disease and childhood obesity that result from children consuming these additives. 
“It feels like we’ve back tracked over the last 30 years. We don’t value health and physical education. We see the results in our children every day,” he said. “Paying to remove chemicals and additives from school meals is not as significant as paying for chronic diseases and childhood obesity. The long term cost is far cheaper.” 
Emma Boyd agrees, noting “kids have fast metabolisms. We burn protein and carbs so fast throughout the day. Who wants to eat the things on that list? Who thinks those are good for kids? Who thinks these things are healthy? Those dyes are not good for anyone; kid’s bodies can’t process any of them. Eating that stuff during the day makes it hard to concentrate and read.” 
Making Indiana kids healthy again is an ambitious endeavor, and policymakers have an opportunity to meet the moment.

After the weather had settled, my boyfriend and I decided to take the adventure of visiting my family’s ranch. They said that this storm would be more difficult than the storm we had in 1994, and I have seen that is the case to some people. However, for us, the storm came and left us with a clean canvas of land; it felt as if God had decided to start over with our Mississippi Delta.
Before leaving our house, I chose to bring my camera to document the spaces we passed. I was suddenly very interested in taking the time to focus on capturing images of southern/Mississippi-specific elements: a familiar cross that we see on the side of the road, maybe a little too familiar; wrought-iron architecture that serves as a staple to our homes; tall, strong magnolia trees that are frozen solid and yet still remain green; and snow-covered fields that look empty canvases, as if God wanted to paint something new.

Jess Bax, director of the Missouri Department of Social Services, told a House committee on Tuesday that her agency needs to hire additional contractors to tackle a backlog of 90,000 Medicaid renewals before more frequent eligibility checks required by the One Big Beautiful Bill approved by Congress last year kick in on Jan. 1, 2027.
And the possibility of penalties for the state’s error rates in administering its Medicaid program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, have intensified pressure on the department to upgrade the software systems it uses for eligibility determinations.

Missouri could face a clawback by the federal government of up to $1.2 billion beginning in October 2029 if it does not reduce its Medicaid error rate to below 3%, Bax said. Missouri’s Medicaid error rate was 35% in 2019, the year of the last federal audit before the COVID-19 pandemic.
The investments the department is requesting, Bax said, “are to avoid putting the state in bankruptcy territory.”
Gov. Mike Kehoe’s budget proposal recommends $294.6 million in new spending in fiscal year 2027 to implement the federal law, including $35 million from state general revenue, out of a total $18.6 billion appropriation for the department.
The department also requested an additional $132 million for implementation of the federal law in the current fiscal year.
Republican state Rep. Darin Chappell of Rogersville, who chairs the House appropriations subcommittee on social services, said lawmakers will work with the department to mitigate error rate penalties.
“We cannot afford a $1.2 billion clawback in three years,” Chappell told The Independent.
“We have to make sure that we don’t lose more by failing to make the necessary upgrades,” he added.
Bax said most of the state’s Medicaid error rate “is associated with being behind on annual redeterminations for Medicaid [due to] not having enough staff.”
Representatives from the department emphasized the importance of kickstarting changes as soon as possible.
Toi Wilde, the department’s chief information officer, underlined the “aggressive timeline” for the department to enact federal changes. States are required to implement new Medicaid work requirements and twice-annual, rather than annual, eligibility recertifications beginning in January 2027. But the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services isn’t expected to issue guidance to states on the details of the changes until June.
“We will meet Medicaid work requirements,” Wilde said. “What I am concerned about is, if we don’t get started quickly, it is going to be much harder to bring the quality to those technology changes needed to start helping us get on that pathway … [to] decreasing the error rates for Medicaid and SNAP.”
Bax said the renewal backlog was partly due to “the sins of our forefathers” — including scant provision for additional staff to handle an influx of enrollees after Missourians voted to expand Medicaid in 2020. A handout distributed to lawmakers indicated that by 2023, there were about 1,000 MO HealthNet enrollees for every frontline staff member dedicated to eligibility, compared to fewer than 600 in 2019.
Lawmakers acknowledged that the department needs to make quick changes to avoid massive federal penalties.
“We’ve got a long way to go,” said Democratic state Rep. Kemp Strickler of Lee’s Summit.
Republican state Rep. Don Mayhew of Crocker asked if the technological investments the department is proposing will lower SNAP and Medicaid error rates.
“That is the plan,” Bax replied.
“Dramatically, or a tiny bit?” asked Mayhew.
“Dramatically,” said Bax.
Even though lawmakers signaled willingness to work with the executive branch, they want to see the cost of investments in implementation of the federal law level off in future years.
“We have to help the department be on the cutting edge of making certain that we are doing the very best we can to provide for those in need, while providing for the taxpayers that we are not wasting any money,” Chappell said.
But state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the numbers suggest that the costs of implementing the federal law and decreases in federal matching funds will not outweigh savings from Missourians who will no longer qualify for Medicaid or SNAP.
“I would argue that in a few years, no matter what we do, we’re going to be in a worse fiscal situation than we are,” Fogle said.
Bax replied that this was accurate, since U.S. lawmakers voted to offset tax credits in the federal law by lowering federal contributions to SNAP and Medicaid.
“Some of those you can potentially mitigate as a state,” Bax said, “and others you cannot.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3498-1024x615.jpeg,,,2026-01-28 07:57:40.662291

That’s where the agreement ends.
A 10-day trial that wrapped Monday in Kansas City laid bare decades of conflict over the state’s abortion laws. Dozens of restrictions — targeted regulation of abortion providers, or TRAP, laws — are being challenged as unconstitutional under Missouri’s voter-approved reproductive rights amendment.
The outcome of this case will determine the future of abortion access in Missouri. In the months ahead, Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang will decide which restrictions survive— and which vanish.
Eleanor Spottswood, an attorney with Planned Parenthood Federation of America, argues the laws were designed to result in abortion being “regulated out of existence.” She described rules that create logistical nightmares for patients and ethical dilemmas for providers —without making procedures safer.
Assistant Solicitor General Alexandria Overcash pushed back, calling Missouri’s abortion regulations  “basic, common sense requirements” necessary to protect patients.
Here is a look at some of the key arguments presented in court over the last two weeks.
 Informed consent

A physician is required to distribute Missouri’s informed consent booklet to patients prior to an abortion. This booklet begins with the statement: “The life of each human being begins at conception. Abortion will terminate the life of a separate, unique, living human being.”
This law is temporarily blocked by an injunction issued by Zhang in July.
Several witnesses called by the attorney general’s office testified that abortion can have negative impacts on mental health. Three women discussed abortions they had in the 1970s and 80s, and each described either having thoughts of self-harm or actually attempting suicide after struggling with depression, anxiety and nightmares.
Multiple long-term studies have found no strong relationship between negative mental health outcomes and abortion, instead saying it varies by personal and social context. The more common negative mental health outcome, researchers say, is one of shame from feeling judged by family and friends.
The women who testified about their abortions also said if they had been given an informed consent booklet and had seen pictures of fetal development, they wouldn’t have gone through with the procedure. 
The gestational sizes of fetuses are on display as part of an anti-abortion rally on March 12, 2024, at the Missouri Capitol (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The booklet also contains a section suggesting a fetus can feel pain as early as eight weeks. This claim is not supported by scientific study. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says a multitude of studies have established that fetuses cannot feel pain until closer to viability, around 24 weeks of pregnancy.
Witnesses called by Planned Parenthood testified that the state-mandated language is medically inaccurate, and that reading it to women harms the patient-provider relationship. 
 72-hour waiting period

Patients are required to have an initial appointment at least 72 hours prior to having their abortion. At this appointment, a doctor walks them through the state’s informed consent language.
This law is temporarily blocked by an injunction issued by Zhang in July.
The attorney general’s office said this “reflection period” is crucial to ensure a woman has time to consider all her options, and to make sure she’s not being coerced into an abortion. 
Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer with Planned Parenthood Great Rivers in the St. Louis region, testified that the waiting period made it exceedingly difficult to coordinate care, especially for those traveling to the clinic from other parts of the state.

 Same physician requirement

The law requires the same physician who conducts the initial appointment must also perform the abortion no sooner than 72 hours later, and that only physicians may perform the procedure.
This law is temporarily blocked by an injunction issued by Zhang in July.
The state said this is necessary to ensure continuity of care for patients and maintain physician oversight for a procedure it considers uniquely complex.
Planned Parenthood witnesses argued the law sharply limits access, especially in rural areas where clinics often lack full-time OB-GYNs.  
Advanced practice clinicians, such as nurse practitioners and midwives, are permitted to perform abortions in Illinois and deliver babies in Missouri without a doctor present. 
 Abortion-facility licensing requirements

Under this law, abortion clinics are inspected by the state health department, which has the authority to revoke the license if any requirements are not met. This includes dozens of requirements, ranging from annual fire drills to infection control protocols and patient record-keeping. 
These requirements are temporarily blocked by an injunction issued by Zhang in July.
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services says if this requirement was struck down, the state would no longer have any oversight authority over abortion clinics, though patients could still file complaints to the Board of Healing Arts or any other professional state licensing boards. 
Peter Donohue, Missouri’s deputy solicitor general, justified the requirement that hallways be six feet wide so a group of “big, burly EMTs” can get through with a gurney during an emergency. The state also made note of a 2018 health inspection at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia that found “black mold and bodily fluid” in tubing. 
Witnesses called by Planned Parenthood disputed this characterization.
Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates clinics in central and western Missouri, said these physical requirements, including recovery room specifications, have prevented her organization from expanding abortion availability outside of Kansas City and Columbia. 
EMTs know how to get patients out of any location, Baum testified, including homes and office buildings that don’t have wide hallways. 
 Medication abortion complication plans

As part of the licensing process, Planned Parenthood must submit a complication plan for approval by the state health department. This requires that an OB-GYN be on-call 24/7 to treat any complications that arise after abortion medication is administered for patients who live within 25 miles of the clinic. 
For those farther away, clinics must have an agreement in place with a local physician.
Evidence presented at trial showed roughly 1% of the 53,000 Missourians who had abortions at the neighboring Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas and Illinois in the past decade experienced a complication. 
An abortion procedure room pictured on March 3, 2025, at Planned Parenthood in Columbia (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
The state brought forward a bevy of witnesses who argued that abortion complications are undercounted and that such plans are necessary to protect women.
Planned Parenthood already has internal recommendations for addressing patient complications, Baum said, including a nursing line that’s staffed 24/7 to answer patient questions. She said prior to the abortion, patients are informed of possible complications and told to go to the closest emergency room if they feel there’s a true emergency. Abortion complications are rare. 
These requirements are still being enforced, and medication abortion is not currently available in Missouri. 
 Fetal tissue pathology

Abortion providers must submit to a pathologist all pregnancy tissue removed during an abortion for special review.
This law is temporarily blocked by an injunction issued by Zhang in July. Baum testified that Planned Parenthood’s guidelines already recommend providers examine fetal tissue to confirm consistency with the estimated gestational age, and that sending tissue to pathology is standard practice when an abnormality is suspected.
The state said the requirement is necessary to catch any medical abnormalities, such as molar pregnancies, which require further treatment.
Wales testified that requiring every tissue sample to be packaged and mailed adds time and expense. About a decade ago, when her clinics were still performing procedural abortions under this statute, she said it added $40 per procedure, a cost that was passed on to the patient.  
 Mandatory pelvic exams 

The state’s licensing rules  require physicians to perform a pelvic exam before administering mifepristone, the first step in a medication abortion, and at least72 hours prior to a procedural abortion. 
This law is temporarily blocked by an injunction issued by Zhang in July.
A 2019 memo from the state health department explained that pelvic exams are used to gather information that “could influence the choice of the procedure or the method.”
No OB-GYNs who testified for Planned Parenthood believed this requirement was medically necessary, calling it invasive and abusive. Because mifepristone is administered orally, Baum testified there’s no medical reason for a patient to undress. Patients who are miscarrying, she noted, aren’t required to undergo this exam before being prescribed the same medications.
Gillian Wilcox, left, legal director at the ACLU of Missouri, and Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, speak to media following a trial litigating abortion regulations under Missouri’s abortion rights amendment on Monday in Kansas City (Kevin Hardy/Stateline).
 Telemedicine ban

State law prohibits physicians from using telehealth to prescribe mifepristone and misoprostol, the medications used to end early pregnancies.  
This law is still being enforced. Planned Parenthood leadership has said that if this law is enjoined, they are prepared to quickly begin prescribing medication abortion again. 
The state argued it’s necessary for patients to first come to the clinic to have an ultrasound to confirm they don’t have an ectopic pregnancy. 
In states allowing telemedicine abortion, Baum said, patients are first screened for ectopic pregnancy. Higher-risk patients, including those using IUDs, are directed to in-person care. She said medication abortion does not increase ectopic risks and may help detect them sooner.
Dr. Daniel Grossman, director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California-San Francisco, testified that rare complications occur only after the full two-drug regimen, not during the initial in-office dose of mifepristone.
 Admitting privilege and written transfer agreement 

State law requires doctors who prescribe abortion medication to have an agreement with a local hospital allowing them to treat the same patient there if needed.
The state argued that because it’s possible to be hospitalized following an abortion, such agreements guarantee the best care for patients. Bleeding and cramping are expected side effects of both medication and procedural abortions. Hemorrhaging and infection are among the rare complications. 
Planned Parenthood’s witnesses testified that this agreement is medically unnecessary because emergency room physicians are trained in miscarriage care, which present the same way as abortion complications. Most emergency rooms are required under federal law to treat anyone who comes into their hospital. 
 Tail insurance

Providers must carry “tail insurance” that is effective for 21 years after a medication abortion takes place. Insurance experts testified that this is not a standalone policy, but rather a way to extend medical malpractice coverage already in place.
This requirement is still being enforced.
The state said this is necessary in case a physician’s medical malpractice insurance is cancelled. State attorneys called Melissa Ohden, founder and CEO of the Abortion Survivors Network, who said people who were born after an attempted abortion don’t realize or know it happened until well into adulthood, and need to have recourse for their pain and suffering. 
Planned Parenthood says regular medical malpractice insurance is sufficient. Wales testified that in 2019, she hired outside legal counsel to look into this requirement after two insurance brokers told her they didn’t sell a policy that would satisfy the state’s requirements. Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, said she also recently tried unsuccessfully to obtain tail insurance. 
“The language of the statute is designed to be difficult to meet, and in fact, impossible to meet,” Wales told reporters at the final day of trial. “We have great medical malpractice insurance, just like every other private OB-GYN in the state, and that coverage should be good enough.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0813-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 06:58:00.619622

As more insurers, hospitals and clinicians use artificial intelligence in health care, state legislators on both sides of the aisle are looking to regulate its use (Joe Raedle/Getty Images).Imagine your physician offering you a new therapy for a serious medical condition—but with several warnings. You are told the treatment has never gone through carefully designed, peer-reviewed clinical trials.
There is no professional licensure overseeing its use. And if something goes wrong, there is no clear system of accountability. Is that the care you would want? Probably not. Yet millions of Americans are doing something remarkably similar when they turn to artificial intelligence chatbots for mental health guidance.
The demand for mental health care in the United States is real and urgent. In 2023, 49,316 people died by suicide—one of the highest totals on record and placing it among the leading causes of death nationwide. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people ages 10–34, surpassed only by unintentional injuries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
At the same time, more than one in five U.S. adults experienced a mental illness in the past year, with depression and anxiety among the most common conditions, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Roughly 5–6% of adults experience a serious mental illness that substantially interferes with major life activities.
Americans clearly need help—and increasingly, they are seeking it wherever they can find it. AI chatbots promise constant availability, anonymity, and convenience, reducing geographic, financial, and scheduling barriers that limit access to traditional mental health services. Estimates suggest that millions of mental-health-related conversations with AI systems now occur each month. For someone who is lonely, anxious, or ashamed to seek care, a chatbot can feel approachable, even comforting.
But popularity should not be confused with safety.
The growing use of chatbots as informal mental health support challenges the most basic principle of medicine and psychology: do no harm. While the Latin phrase primum non nocere is often attributed to Hippocrates—its precise origins are debated—the ethical idea is foundational and enduring. Clinicians are trained to weigh risks against benefits, to exercise particular caution with unproven or experimental interventions, and to protect patients from iatrogenic harm, or harm caused by the intervention itself.
In traditional health care, extensive guardrails exist to operationalize that principle. Medications undergo phased testing. Serious risks are disclosed through boxed warnings. Licensed professionals practice under defined standards of care and are subject to supervision, institutional review, malpractice accountability, and licensure board oversight. When care is dangerous or incompetent, there are established mechanisms to intervene.
No clinically grounded/regulatory system of guardrails comparable to the healthcare licensure system exists for AI chatbots.
These systems are not licensed clinicians. They do not practice under a recognized standard of care. They are not supervised. Their behavior can change with prompts, software updates, or business incentives. Yet many are marketed—or at least experienced by users—as supportive, empathetic, or therapy-like, blurring the line between informal support and clinical care.
Emerging research raises serious concerns about this gap. An ethics analysis by researchers affiliated with Brown University mapped multiple ethical risk domains linked to large-language-model-based AI counselors, including simulated or misleading expressions of empathy, oversimplified, one-size fits all solutions, reinforcement of maladaptive beliefs, and inappropriate responses in crisis situations.
These concerns are no longer abstract. Multiple lawsuits now allege that teenagers were harmed after intensive engagement with AI chatbots, including wrongful-death suits tied to alleged suicides. Families claim that these systems fostered emotional dependency, failed to redirect youths in crisis to human help, or reinforced harmful thinking.
While courts will determine legal responsibility, the existence of multiple cases involving minors underscores a pressing public-health question: why are tools with no clinical oversight increasingly functioning as de facto mental health supports for vulnerable youth?
Independent reporting reinforces these concerns. A 2025 investigation by The Verge examined how several major AI chatbots responded to users expressing suicidal distress. The findings were uneven and concerning: users were pointed to geographically inappropriate resources, conversations by the AI were continued as if nothing concerning had been said, or delays were introduced before offering assistance. In a genuine crisis, wrong information and extra steps are not minor glitches—they are safety failures.
Research organizations have reached similar conclusions. RAND researchers found that widely used chatbots can be inconsistent when responding to suicide-related questions, particularly in high-risk or ambiguous scenarios. These are precisely the situations where consistency, structured assessment, and rapid escalation to higher levels of care matter most.
This stands in sharp contrast to professional training. Clinicians are taught to recognize red flags such as suicidality, psychosis, abuse, or intoxication; to assess risk systematically; and to route individuals to appropriate emergency or specialty care. AI systems are not trained in the moral or clinical sense. They are optimized—and optimization does not guarantee safety.
It is therefore understandable why states have begun to act. Utah and Illinois, for example, have enacted legislation addressing mental health chatbots, and officials in multiple states have raised concerns about AI companions, youth exposure, and consumer deception. Missouri should not lag behind.
The path forward does not require rejecting innovation. It requires aligning innovation with the ethical expectations we already apply to health care.
No matter the innovation—from automobiles to aviation to pharmaceuticals—we have always recognized the need for guardrails to protect public safety. Mental health should be no exception. When people reach out for help in their darkest moments, they deserve more than a system trained to sound caring. They deserve protections grounded in evidence, ethics, and accountability.
Do no harm is not a slogan. It is a public obligation. Missouri should act to ensure that emerging AI tools meet that obligation—particularly where vulnerable groups, such youth or individuals with poor access to care, are concerned.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2158156583-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2026-01-28 06:58:00.619622

(Screenshot)Hoosier hospitals say they’re increasingly struggling to stay open as expenses rise faster than revenue, according to a new analysis.
“Margins remain quite fragile and somewhat anemic” in Indiana, said Erik Swanson, a managing director at health care consultancy Kaufman Hall, citing results released in a Tuesday news conference.
The analysis, performed on behalf of the Indiana Hospital Association, showed that operating margins at hospitals in the state declined from 2.1% in 2024 to 1.9% in 2025, through August. In the meantime, the national median rose from 1.5% to 2.6%.
“A significant number of Indiana hospitals, particularly rural and safety net hospitals, are operating with little or no financial cushion,” Indiana Hospital Association President Scott Tittle told reporters. “Hospital finances are not abstract. They directly affect patient access.”
“Now, there’s a persistent narrative at the Statehouse and nationally that hospitals are doing just fine,” Tittle continued. “What this report demonstrates is the exact opposite.”
Operating income at Hoosier hospitals declined 5.5% through August 2025 compared to 2024, while operating expenses rose 4.7%. In contrast, income rose 12% nationwide — more than the 6.7% growth in expenses. Medical supply and purchased service expenses were up in Indiana, as were labor costs, despite a nearly 50% decrease in reliance on contract workers.
Conditions are expected to worsen under President Donald Trump’s recently approved One Big Beautiful Bill Act and other factors.

The share of Indiana patients on Medicaid is expected to drop from 20% to 18% by 2030, as is the share on marketplace plans: from 7% to 5%. Meanwhile, the proportion of uninsured patients is projected to go from 8% to 10%. The report predicts the share of patients on Medicare will rise only slightly, from 20% to 21%, and the share with commercial insurance will stay at 46%.
Medicaid and Medicare both reimburse hospitals at a fraction of the cost they spend on care, but hospitals often lose out entirely when caring for patients without any form of insurance.
“As the percent of uninsured individuals rises, uncompensated care will increase, leading to greater pressures on hospital margins,” the report noted.
About 40% of Hoosier hospitals are already operating in the red, Swanson estimated — including several news conference participants.
Greene County General Hospital CEO Brenda Reetz told reporters her southwestern Indiana facility lost $1.4 million last year. The hospital has just 10 days’ worth of cash on hand.
“I get increasingly concerned whenever I hear our legislators and other leaders … villainizing health care for making money,” she said.
Reetz explained that as a county hospital, “no individual” would profit if the facility were to make money. The funds would go to a rainy day account and then be spent on infrastructure. The boilers, she said, are 10 years past their 40-year lifespan, but a new boiler costs about $15 million.
Indiana unveils multi-year rural health plan in newly released federal application

“What if you were never able to tuck anything away in savings? What if you were actually spending more than you were making every month?” she asked. “… That’s the situation that almost every rural hospital in the state of Indiana is facing right now.”
Greene County General Hospital’s obstetrics unit is closing on Sunday, after more than 100 years of delivering babies, because it could no longer absorb the losses incurred on those services.
“We’re going to continue to see more and more cuts like this throughout the state, if something isn’t done — if payers aren’t held accountable, if legislators aren’t held accountable, to ensuring the safety and the future of our safety net hospitals and health care providers throughout the state,” Reetz said.
Several hospital leaders pushed for higher Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates, plus greater focus on uncooperative insurers.
Reetz, for instance, said Greene County General Hospital been underpaid by its largest commercial payers, UnitedHealthcare and Elevance Health, for the last two years, with millions more dollars withheld. Elevance was previously known as Anthem.
While United has answered Reetz’s calls and worked with her hospital, she said Elevance hasn’t paid a single claim in the last 90 days — and even clawed back payments for third-trimester ultrasounds from 2023 that the insurer is no longer covering.
“I feel like I’m getting bullied,” Reetz said. “… In any other industry, this would be absurd.”
Tittle, of the Indiana Hospital Association, said several prominent studies and databases rely on “incomplete” claims data or expense types, and “added to this narrative that hospitals are doing just fine.”
“Solutions must be … based on actual claims-paid data and accurate financial analysis,” he said.

One Republican, Indianapolis Sen. Kyle Walker, joined all Democrats present in opposition.
“The minimum damages award is paid directly by the defendant — the manufacturer, the distributor, the provider or aider and abettor — not by pregnant women, taxpayers or the state,” said Republican Sen. Tyler Johnson, a physician from Leo.

“It is the violator who bears the cost, creating a powerful deterrent against illegal trafficking of these life-ending drugs,” he told colleagues on the Senate floor.
His Senate Bill 236 would prohibit manufacturing, distributing, mailing, prescribing or possessing abortion-inducing drugs in Indiana — with exceptions for a pregnant woman’s own actions, the drugs’ other uses, the U.S. Constitution and federal law.
Anyone except the state and local governments could enforce the ban through two types of civil lawsuits. Those are explicitly barred from taking or threatening “direct or indirect enforcement.”
Offenses would carry a 20-year statute of limitations for lawsuits.
“Twenty years — that is not certainty; that is a long-tail liability regime,” said Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, who added that would tempt “gotcha lawsuits years after the fact.”
One option afforded to private individuals and groups is qui tam, or suing on behalf of the government. They’d be assignees of the state’s claim for relief, with the state retaining none.

The bill would require courts to award successful qui tam plaintiffs at least $100,000 per violation and attorney’s fees.
“It is an invitation for speculative lawsuits, pressured settlements and cottage-industry litigation,” Yoder, of Bloomington, said.
The second option given is a wrongful death action. If a claimant couldn’t identify the manufacturer of the drug that caused the fatality or injury, liability would be split between all manufacturers, in proportion with their share of the national market at the time.
In both lawsuit types, the legislation largely prohibits courts from awarding legal costs to successful defendants.
Yoder summed the bill as “extreme, legally reckless and structurally designed to inflame conflict rather than to produce careful governance.”
“Whatever your underlying views are on abortion, this is not how we should write Indiana laws,” she said. “Writing statute that tr(ies) to handcuff the judiciary, narrow defenses and structurally favor one side of litigation with mandatory awards and limited fee-shifting is not the way.”
Supporters asserted the topic was worth creative enforcement.
Abortion-inducing drug ban’s lawsuit, reporting provisions take heat

“I have always been an advocate for tort reform in this state, but that’s not what we’re talking about here today,” said Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, during floor discussion on Monday. “We’re talking about saving the life of the unborn, and we’re talking about the most egregious business practices that have invaded the state. … So, yeah, I’m okay with suing them.”
Senate Bill 236 would separately authorize the state’s attorney general to sue — on behalf of the fetuses of Indiana residents — anyone who violates federal abortion drug mail laws.
Another provision redefines “abortion” in state code to any means intended to “cause the death of an unborn child,” with some exceptions.
But medical professionals repeatedly said the new wording doesn’t account for other dangerous conditions, like often pre-cancerous molar pregnancies. They feared more doctors would be responsible for filing terminated pregnancy reports than under current law and warned that life-saving care could be delayed as providers worry over the legalities of that care.
Democrats on Monday offered amendments to delete the qui tam provisions, undo the proposed definition change and more, but all failed in voice votes. 
Johnson initially sought to put more abortion reporting requirements into law, but amended those proposed additions out of the bill Monday.
Senate Bill 236 next heads to the House for consideration.

Both bills also seek to increase the minimum age to perform in strip clubs from 18 to 21.
House Bill 3832, by Rep. Stan May, R-Broken Arrow, is dubbed the “Entertainer Safety and Verification Act” while Senate Bill 1284, by Sen. Warren Hamilton, R-McCurtain, is called the “Exotic Entertainer Licensing Act.”
Under both measures, the Alcoholic Beverage Law Enforcement commission would issue the license and promulgate rules governing the process. 
Information provided to the agency from those seeking a license shall be kept confidential, with exceptions for ABLE and law enforcement. Those seeking a license must be a U.S. citizen or legal resident and not have committed certain felonies, according to both measures. Applicants must also provide proof of identity, including a government-issued identification document with a picture.
Hamilton and May said the measures are needed to reduce human trafficking.
“We are going to require the identifications,” May said. “Whether you agree with those places or not, we should all agree people participating should be doing it of their own free will and not being trafficked from another state or country.”
Once a person begins working as a stripper, it is hard to break free, May said.
Hamilton said the state has a responsibility to protect children and said the licensing requirements were requested by the Tulsa and Oklahoma City police departments.
Strippers United, a nonprofit that advocates for workers’ rights and safety, did not respond to a request for comment.
Across the country, a patchwork system governs requirements for strippers. Some states have left it up to local cities and counties to create requirements governing adult entertainers. 
Employees working in the industry in other states have expressed concerns about whether the public licensing databases that contain their personal information and photographs can open them to harm and exploitation if accessed by the wrong people.
Under both bills, first-time offenders who perform without a license or with an expired license face a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine, one year confinement or both.
Under May’s bill, the fine increases to $1,000 for a second violation while Hamilton’s bill increases the fine to $10,000.
The measures also outline the penalties for businesses found to be in violation.
Tulsa Police Sgt. Nick Wheeler said it would be inappropriate to comment on pending legislation.
The Oklahoma City Police Department declined to comment, but said it met with the Tulsa Police Department to discuss it.
Both measures have an effective date of Nov. 1.

Lawmakers will mull issues ranging from housing inmates with mental health needs to funding Wyoming’s beleaguered 911 system.
The post Stiffer penalties and new rules: Wyoming justice, policing and public safety issues to watch this session appeared first on WyoFile .","While passing a state budget remains the key priority this legislative session, lawmakers will also consider reforms and updates to the state’s policing and public safety laws, from restrictions on certain library books to better funding 911 services. 
The Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee sponsored seven bills, an unusually low number, for lawmakers to consider this session. The measures tackle issues ranging from housing inmates with mental health needs to tightening penalties for various criminal offenses. Bills from other committees — such as the Joint Corporations, Elections and Subdivisions Committee proposal to study and fund Wyoming’s 911 operations — also deal with public safety issues. 
Inmates and mental health
In January last year, Uinta County Sheriff Andy Kopp emailed a letter to members of the Legislature that described a growing problem in jails: More and more, jails have housed people with mental illnesses while they wait for a bed at the state hospital. Meanwhile, their mental health issues go untreated. 
“Without timely and adequate resources or support systems, many of these individuals continue to suffer and deteriorate more,” Kopp wrote in the letter. 
While the health department recognizes this situation as a problem, current statutes don’t provide the agency with resources or authority to pay for housing inmates or providing care while they wait in jails.
The letter spurred health officials and law enforcement to work on a new measure that would enable the state’s health department to help cover these costs. From that effort emerged the Joint Judiciary Committee’s Senate File 10, “Contracts for holding and treating mentally ill detainees,” which allows the health department to enter into contracts with detention centers for holding and treating detainees with mental illnesses until they receive a competency evaluation or restoration, which often means an inpatient commitment to the Wyoming State Hospital. 
This reimbursement model is similar to one that now allows the Wyoming Department of Corrections to reimburse sheriffs for housing inmates until they get transferred. The bill’s contract language aims to provide some flexibility so the health department could simply reimburse sheriffs for housing inmates or providing mental health services to these individuals through local practitioners. 
English proficiency for truck drivers 
President Donald Trump issued an executive order in April to crack down on commercial drivers’ English. Previously, authorities allowed commercial drivers who lacked English proficiency to continue on the journey. Now, highway patrol officers across the country work under guidelines that direct them to test drivers’ English if they suspect a lack of proficiency in the language. If drivers fail the test, they are taken out of service and forced to park until a different driver arrives to take over. 
Wyoming’s U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman backed Trump’s move and cosponsored legislation to codify Trump’s executive order into law. 
“This has been a hot topic nationwide amongst all states across the United States,” Wyoming Highway Patrol Lt. Kyle McKay told lawmakers at an August meeting. 
From June 25 through Aug. 17 of last year, the Wyoming Highway Patrol encountered 236 violations of English proficiency standards where drivers were put out of service, McKay said. (Only Wyoming Highway Patrol inspectors are now certified to enforce this federal regulation. Normal troopers can’t enforce it.) 
House Bill 32, “English proficiency-commercial motor vehicle drivers,” sponsored by the Joint Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Interim Committee, would codify this requirement in state statute. It also directs county and municipal law enforcement and other officers designated by highway patrol to police and enforce English proficiency among commercial truck drivers. 
The measure would establish a $1,000 fine for drivers who fail the test and bar them from driving until they can demonstrate English proficiency. If a driver is found continuing to operate a commercial vehicle while still lacking English proficiency, they would be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished with another $1,000 fine, up to 90 days in jail, or both.
Arkansas and Oklahoma have passed similar bills. Oklahoma’s bill “has a little more teeth in it,” Wyoming Highway Patrol Col. Tim Cameron said. Like HB 32, Oklahoma’s statute also addresses situations where drivers who are found to lack English proficiency are later caught continuing to operate a commercial vehicle. 
Funding 911 operations
Wyoming has an estimated $3 million funding shortfall across its counties for 911 operations, Nate Smolinski, Wyoming Department of Transportation’s chief technology officer and 911 coordinator, told lawmakers at a November meeting. 
Current 911 funding is based on a maximum $0.75 monthly surcharge per phone line set in 1986, which hasn’t kept pace with inflation and rising costs of running 911 centers, according to a Wyoming Department of Transportation memo. “Many counties are experiencing deficits, and the current funding model doesn’t cover all of the operational expenses,” the memo states. 
What’s more, funding struggles combined with aging infrastructure have impacted the reliability of 911 operations — Smolinski told lawmakers at the November meeting that there had recently been a 911 outage in Sheridan County, during which emergency calls had to be routed through Johnson County. According to the transportation department’s memo, these outages “are increasing and can have life-threatening impacts.” 
Senate File 32, “911 funding,” sponsored by the Joint Corporations Committee, aims to address these challenges in one measure. The bill directs the Wyoming Department of Transportation to conduct a study that examines potential upgrades to Wyoming’s 911 system. The study would cover the governance, operations and expenses of operating the 911 system and would also seek out efficiencies to implement. The measure would appropriate $750,000 from the Legislative Stabilization Reserve Account to cover the costs of conducting the study. 
It also earmarks $3 million from the same account to provide a stopgap for existing 911 operations until the state and counties improve systems and establish long-term sources of funding. The $3 million would be distributed through grants, though lawmakers have yet to decide which agency would administer the grant program. 
Library book restrictions
The Joint Judiciary Committee also sponsored a bill related to the now long-running debate in Wyoming and across the nation over what library books should be available to minors. Much of this debate has centered on books about LGBTQ experiences. 
While this debate originally focused mostly on school libraries, lawmakers have also tried to restrict — so far without success — the availability of “sexually explicit” books in public libraries. 
House Bill 10, “Sexually explicit materials in libraries-requirements,” covers both, dictating where public libraries can shelve certain books and banning what the bill defines as “sexually explicit material” from school libraries altogether. The measure would also require counties and school districts to create processes for people to challenge the inclusion or placement of books in libraries. 
The bill’s supporters use the word “pornographic” to describe the materials they are trying to weed out of libraries. Meanwhile, opponents of the measure say lawmakers are intruding into libraries in an attempt to silence LGBTQ authors primarily. 
Tightening criminal penalties
The Joint Judiciary Committee approved several bills to tighten penalties and lower punishable thresholds for various crimes. 
Currently, a person could be guilty of a felony and be punished by up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine if they are convicted of five or more theft offenses. Senate File 7, “Theft amendments,” would cut that threshold down to three offenses. 
The bill would also increase punishment for one-off theft offenses, raising the max time for imprisonment from six months to a year and fines from $750 to $1,500. 
Lawmakers also proposed revising Wyoming laws around distributing methamphetamine and Schedule I and II controlled substances to minors. The law now provides a more lenient punishment if the distributor is within three years of the minor’s age. Senate File 9, “Fentanyl to minors-enhanced penalty,” would axe that exception for distributing fentanyl to children. 
Under existing Wyoming law, a person who stalks someone in violation of probation, parole, bail or a restraining order is guilty of a felony and could go to prison for up to 10 years. House Bill 8, “Stalking of Minors,” would add stalking a child to the list of stalking offenses that could result in a felony. 
Senate File 8, “Absconding for criminal purposes-criminal offense,” would create penalties for fleeing across county or state lines for criminal purposes. The penalty for fleeing would be the same as that for the most serious crime committed, intended to be committed or furthered as a result of running away.
House Bill 9, “Grooming of children-offenses and amendments,” would create a new criminal offense for grooming minors. The offense would be a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000, or both. 
Those penalties would increase for younger ages. If someone committed this offense against a child younger than 16, they could be imprisoned for not less than four years and up to life. For a child younger than 12, the punishment would be at least 25 years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000, or both. 
Bills yet to be seen 
While lawmakers typically prioritize committee bills, given that they’ve already spent time and money vetting them, these proposals make up just a portion of all the measures they consider in a session. Bills sponsored by individual lawmakers, like Casper Republican Rep. Steve Harshman’s measure that would require people to help others at risk of serious injury or death, will also be on the books for lawmakers to mull over. More bills from individual lawmakers can still surface, and they likely will. 
In early January, lawmakers on the Joint Appropriations Committee convened behind closed doors to discuss reducing the Wyoming Supreme Court’s bench from five justices to three, WyoFile previously reported. The discussion was in response to the Wyoming Supreme Court’s recent ruling striking down two abortion bans. Although the committee ultimately didn’t take action on this proposal, it’s still possible that an individual lawmaker would try to carry a bill.

With the Republican-led Michigan House reviving legislation aimed at banning cell phones in schools to kick off the year after a failed vote on the bill last July, the House voted 99-10 to send state Rep. Mark Tisdel’s (R-Rochester Hills) House Bill 4141 to the Senate for further consideration alongside Sen. Dayna Polehanki’s (D-Livonia) Senate Bill 495. Last week, the Senate passed both Tisdel and Polehanki’s bills by identical 34-1 margins.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While the majority of gubernatorial candidates applauded the Legislature’s bipartisan effort to pass the bills, some expressed frustration that the legislation should have passed last year given its overwhelming support across party lines. Others believe there are bigger issues facing the state and that local school districts should have control in crafting their own cell phone use policies.
Michigan Advance reached out to the 11 remaining gubernatorial candidates to ask what their opinions were on K-12 cell phone bans. The candidates’ responses are listed below. Republican candidates Mike Cox, Anthony Hudson and Perry Johnson did not respond to requests for comment.
 
Joceyln Benson
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said as a former teacher and the daughter of special education teachers, she knows Michigan students need structure, attention and support. 
“This bipartisan legislation is a win for Michigan’s kids,” Benson said in a statement. “But passing a bill is only step one. As CEO of the state’s second-largest agency, I’ve learned that good policy means nothing without smart implementation. We need to partner with teachers, students, and communities to roll this out in a way that actually works.”
 
Mike Duggan
Former Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, an independent candidate for governor, said he was glad to see the cell phone ban bill passed in the House. However, he believes fighting between Republicans and Democrats over the issue last year is emblematic of the problems facing the state, given the overwhelming support the bills have received from both parties this year.
“This is the problem: It’s something that the vast majority of people in this state want, and yet you have to go through almost a year of partisan wrangling before you can get it done,” Duggan said in an interview. “But at least they got it done. I’m glad they did.”
“The Democrats didn’t want (Rep. Mark) Tisdel, or a Republican in a swing seat, to get an advantage by being a (bill) sponsor and getting credit. I talk to people about the fact that we know what the solutions are, but Lansing is so broken, they can’t even do things that 80% of Michigan residents agree on.”
 
John James
U.S. Rep. John James’ campaign provided a statement from the Shelby Township Republican’s X account regarding his position on the school cell phone bill:
“I’m glad to see Speaker @RepMattHall & @MI_Republicans stepping up to help students focus on their most important job: learning and preparing for their future, not being glued to a screen … As governor, I will always fight to protect our kids, not Silicon Valley.”
 
Tom Leonard
The former Republican Speaker of the Michigan House said he has been clear in supporting a ban on cell phones during instructional time in order to foster a more conducive environment for learning, stressing that there should be room in a policy for schools to allow cell phone use during some non-instructional times.
“I have been equally clear in my belief that a cell phone policy adopted by individual school districts ought to preserve parent-child communication rights during non-instructional time, such as between classes, during lunch, and before or after school,” Leonard said in a statement. “Ultimately, as long as they remain responsive to parents, educators, and students in developing solutions that work for everyone, local school boards should be best positioned to craft policies that reflect their communities’ unique needs.”
 
Aric Nesbitt
Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) provided the following statement after the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would give school districts the authority to ban cellphone use during class time:
“We must do everything we can to help our kids succeed in school and make it in Michigan because they have fallen further and further behind under the failed direction of Gov. Whitmer and Lansing Democrats. Once a national leader, Michigan now ranks among the bottom 10 states for education, and the vast majority of our third and fourth graders cannot read at grade level. This is unacceptable, and it must change,” Nesbitt said.
 
Ralph Rebandt
Former pastor and Republican candidate Ralph Rebandt said he strongly supports local control to enact policies or bans on cell phone use in schools.
“In Michigan, school board members already have the responsibility and authority to approve budgets, curriculum, and staffing decisions within their districts,” Rebandt said in an email. “It seems obvious that this authority also includes adopting a cell phone policy. In fact, districts are already doing it — the Okemos School District recently passed its own cell phone policy.”
“I do support limiting cell phone use during the school day, but I believe those decisions should be made locally with parental involvement, not imposed by a one-size-fits-all mandate from Lansing.”
 
Chris Swanson
Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, a Democrat, applauded the bipartisan support to pass the cell phone ban in the House as a “long time coming,” noting that he believes it will help increase focus and literacy in schools. Swanson also said he was glad the bill allows for some exemptions for cell phone use, including in emergencies.
“There has to be a pathway and an efficient and effective way for parents and guardians to get ahold of their loved ones,” Swanson said, noting the bill does allow for that. “By supporting the bill as a faculty member and UM Flint teacher, when I’m teaching with the students, I want them to focus. I don’t want them to be distracted. When they’re distracted it actually distracts me as the teacher. The benefit of literacy and concentration makes total sense.”
 
Karla Wagner
Republican candidate Karla Wagner said as a “conservative constitutionalist,” she believes Michigan has “way bigger problems” and doesn’t think the government needs to be “micromanaging.” She also said she thinks removing the phones from the classroom for high schoolers who have had them for years is a mistake, noting that if there is a ban, it should start with the lower grades.
“I don’t know why they decide to do some of the things that they do, but for me personally, I think we have way bigger problems to deal with,” Wagner said. “Yes, our education sucks. The quality of our public education sucks. So are they thinking that this is going to help our education? I think they’re wrong. I think there’s a lot more root issues to why our education and the public school system is bad.” 
“The schools can be given the choice if they want to do it. I’ve seen some parent groups come out and say, ‘Hey, we’re going to monitor what our kids are doing,’ or whether they’re going to have their phones on them, or this or that, or whatever else. Give it back to parental control,” Wagner said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cyber-security-700x472-1.jpeg,,,2026-01-28 06:58:00.619622

As Jackson annexes a small parcel of national forest, the novel public-private partnership raises questions about building employee housing on public lands.
The post Wyoming public land housing project spurs debate over land use appeared first on WyoFile .","A western Wyoming housing project’s public-private partnership between the Bridger-Teton National Forest and nonprofit Jackson Hole Community Housing Trust has sparked debate over whether housing development supports or undermines land stewardship. Operating under what advocates are calling a “first of its kind” 30-year Forest Service special-use permit, the project aims to provide essential worker housing on public land.
“It’s not a lease. It’s not a sale,” Jackson Mayor Arne Jorgensen told WyoFile, comparing it to agreements ski resorts have to build infrastructure on national forest land. “It’s an agreement between the Forest Service and other entities that say, ‘you can use this property under these conditions.’”

The Jackson Town Council voted unanimously last week to initiate the annexation of the 3.15-acre forest parcel. The council will need to vote three more times to make the annexation official.
The property abuts the Cache Creek trail system, where residents and visitors hike, bike and walk their dogs. Project plans call for building 36 affordable homes, with 13 set aside for Forest Service employees and the remaining 23 designated for local workers who meet income qualifications through the Housing Trust. While annexing the land does not guarantee development, it would make it possible to connect the homes to the town’s established municipal water and septic systems.
The lack of essential housing 
Employee housing is critical for maintaining public lands, according to Scott Fitzwilliams, who retired from the Forest Service after 35 years and served as supervisor of the White River National Forest in the Colorado Rockies. Federal employees are needed to take care of public lands, which include wildlife habitat conservation, trail rehabilitation and fire prevention, he said. 
“What we’re looking at is the future without workers,” Fitzwilliams said, if there’s not a solution to house workers on or near the lands they manage. 
The affordable housing crisis has only worsened in mountain towns across the West in the three decades since Fitzwilliams worked for the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Jackson earlier in his career. Seeking to address the issue in 2023 on White River National Forest, Fitzwilliams authorized the lease of 11 acres of Forest Service land in Dillon, Colorado, for affordable housing under the 2018 Farm Bill.
“We should have been thinking about this 30 years ago,” Fitzwilliams said. “We have a county like Teton County where 98% of the land is federal land. If we’re going to have employees that work for the land agencies or doctors, nurses, teachers, police officers and firefighters, we’ve got to do something about this affordability issue.”
Like Fitzwilliams, Phil Hocker has watched the problem play out over the decades. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hocker lived on Nelson Drive, which borders the forest administrative land where the 36 new units are planned. A longtime conservationist, Forest Service watchdog and former Jackson resident, Hocker sent an open letter in October to Bridger-Teton National Forest Supervisor Chad Hudson. In the letter, Hocker details his support for the Nelson Drive housing project. When he lived on Nelson Drive decades ago, many of his neighbors were federal employees. Living in Jackson Hole has shaped the attitudes and spirit of many local wildlife biologists, recreation managers and forest planners, he told WyoFile. Nelson Drive was initially built to access Forest Service housing, he recalled. 
“The guy who lived next door to us was a range conservation expert,” Hocker said. “Now, the Forest Service is caught in this housing bind. If you move employees to outside communities, it will be an immense loss. Loss to the town. Loss to the conservation around the town and a loss to all of Wyoming. And I think to all of the country.”

While Hocker remains neutral on incorporating private-sector units on the Nelson parcel, he conceded that compromises must be made to help finance federal housing projects. 
But housing private-sector employees on public lands is a no-go for the Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance. While voicing support for federal housing on public lands, the group’s conservation director, Catherine Hughes, told WyoFile that private residential use on federally owned land would set a troubling precedent for the community, state and nation. The project’s special-use permit could provide a blueprint to other communities and slowly chip away at public lands.
Fitzwilliams doesn’t see it that way. When responding to the possibility that this special-use permit could open the floodgates for development sprawl on public land, the retired supervisor described the alliance as “chasing ghosts.” Building housing on “administrative sites” is not going to create a public land “free for all,” he said. 
“What we’re looking at is the future without workers.”Scott Fitzwilliams, retired U.S. Forest Service Supervisor
Only administrative sites — underutilized federal lands with already existing housing structures, offices or warehouses — are designated for housing, he said. Leasing federal lands should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, he added, noting that the Nelson Drive project would access a “tiny piece of already developed administrative land that could demonstrate a real benefit for the community.” 
The Forest Service isn’t the only federal agency looking to federal land to house staff. Just down the street, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has taken steps to bump back elk exclusionary fencing to make room for worker housing at the agency’s East Broadway headquarters. Last fall, National Park Service staff staked out a location for 12 proposed employee housing units on Grand Teton National Park land bordering the unincorporated hamlet of Kelly on the park’s eastern edge, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reported. 
Greased skid or slippery slope?
The federal government designated the Nelson Drive parcel as an administrative site decades ago, Mayor Jorgensen said. The town has heard public concerns about the potential privatization of federal land and worries that this project creates a “slippery slope.” While understanding people’s concerns, Jorgensen supported the addition of private units to create a sustainable funding stream for federal housing. As for precedent, Jorgensen didn’t want to speculate on what other communities might do.
“I can’t speak to other places,” Jorgensen said. “I can’t speak to how this gets applied nationally. This is a solution that works for us in a very complex housing market. If we choose not to find ways to support our public land managers, then we’re going to degrade their ability to manage our public land.”
The fear surrounding the potential loss of public lands is understandable, Fitzwilliams said. He noted Sen. Mike Lee’s, R-Utah, push to add a provision to President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill to authorize the widespread sale or transfer of public lands.
“I don’t trust this administration when it comes to public lands one bit,” Fitzwilliams said. “We’re watching the deliberate dismantling of public lands across the board.”
But the Nelson Drive housing project is about protecting public lands, not dismantling them, he said, calling it a great example of public-private collaboration to solve a critical problem. Since the Forest Service lacks the needed resources to construct its own housing, Fitzwilliams said that a partnership is needed to generate the necessary funding.

The Nelson Drive project will be funded through a combination of private and public funds, including local Specific Purpose Excise Tax money (a voter-approved 1% sales tax), the sale of “first-right-of-rental” options, philanthropy, commercial financing and a $2.3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, according to Jackson Hole Community Housing Trust Executive Director Anne Cresswell. All of the rental revenue will be used to service debt or pay for operating costs, such as insurance and snow removal, she said.
“What the [Forest Service] does have is the land,” Fitzwilliams said. “So the agency says, we’ll provide the land, if you provide the building. So, it’s just a great opportunity.”
Drew McConville, a senior fellow focused on land conservation at the Center for American Progress, drew a distinct line between massive land sell-offs and regional land acquisitions that can help serve communities and benefit adjacent open space. 
“When it comes to smaller, isolated transfers,” McConville said, “most conservation organizations are not opposed in principle to all public land transfer sales because, at the end of the day, it can lead to net benefits for public lands and conservation.”
No matter how large or small the acreage, McConville recommended a reversionary clause to allow property to return to federal ownership if public needs are not met or if public lands are not improved. The Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance has called for the special-use permit to include a provision that restricts housing units exclusively for publicly employed individuals. If private-sector units are offered, Hughes said that housing should be prioritized for federal, state, town and county workers.

Getting inked pleasantly surprised septuagenarian columnist Rod Miller.
The post My first tattoo appeared first on WyoFile .","Damn few human beings are blessed with a body as perfect as mine. So, I’m very choosy about how I decorate it.

Opinion

That’s why, when I decided to get the first ink on my septuagenarian hide, I asked my granddaughter, Maya, to do the honors. Now I can go surfing at Seminoe and make all the other cowboys green with envy. This column is about my first tattoo.
Let me tell you about Maya. She is the first gal born into the Miller family in 91 years. My clan is very prone to throwing horse colts. Naturally, we had no idea how to raise a girl, so in Maya’s infancy, we stocked up on pink duds and selected a few convents, charm schools and ballet programs to help her along the path to womanhood.
Instead, Maya chose to play ice hockey because she considered bull riding and MMA too lame. She’s retired from hockey now, after winning a roomful of awards and trophies, and she just embarked upon her lifelong ambition to become a tattoo artist.
For the past couple of years, Maya has used her older bro, Landon, to practice her craft. My grandson is pretty well tatted up and is proud to show off his little sister’s work. So Maya turned pro.

I made an appointment with her at Beautiful Addiction (I love that name!), her tattoo shop, and began my own journey to an inked life. When I parked in front of Maya’s shop, I expected to see basket case hardtail Harley choppers leaking oil on the pavement, but Beautiful Addiction is in the Frontier Mall and they discourage that sort of behavior.
I walked through the door prepared to hear Motörhead or Metallica blaring from speakers, and see a cloud of cigar smoke. But the shop looked more like an upscale spa or salon than a poolroom … neat as a pin with a soothing vibe. The surfaces were shiny, and the walls covered with photos of some really wild body art.
I wanted a Wyoming motif for my first tattoo, and Maya got down to business inking a familiar cowboy trope on my left pectoral. It’s Steamboat with Clayton Danks aboard, just like our license plates. Before you even start with that “who is that cowboy?” debate, it’s my chest and my tattoo, so I get to name the cowboy! Danks it is.
I had steeled myself to endure some sort of enhanced-interrogation agony that would make me spill all my secrets, but the sensation was more irritation than pain. Maya is smoooooth at her work, and constantly checked my vital signs to make sure I stayed on this side of the daisies. A mild sunburn is how I’d describe what I felt throughout the process.
The only other body mod I have is a 25-year-old brand on my right pec. It’s a big cursive letter “L” that one of my ex-wives applied. It was supposed to say “If found, please return to Lorraine, 537 Naples St., Corpus Christi, TX,” but I didn’t get past the “L” before I tapped out.
That brand hurt like hell when she sizzled it on. I felt like I’d been shot by a bazooka and it smelled like grilled stinkbugs. Probably my karmic comeuppance for the tens of thousands of calves I’ve put through the same torture. Pain-wise, a tattoo pales by comparison.
When she finished up, Maya slathered some special tattoo after-care ointment on Steamboat and Clayton, covered ‘em in Saran wrap and shooed me out the door. Before I left, I gave my granddaughter a big hug and didn’t feel a smidgen of pain.
I’m including photographic proof so y’all don’t conclude that this is just another campfire yarn.
I’m glad it didn’t hurt; I must be getting sort of wimpy in my golden years. And if we meet on the street, and I suddenly rip open my shirt, please don’t take it the wrong way. It’s simply that I’m awfully proud of my new tattoo!

(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, Pool)A bill expanding Indiana’s execution methods was significantly amended Tuesday after lawmakers voted to remove nitrogen hypoxia as an option and added provisions on media access and mental health support.
House Bill 1119, authored by Rep. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, is still pending a final full chamber vote which must take place by Monday for the bill to continue moving through the legislative process.
Among the adopted amendments were two from Rep. Alex Zimmerman, R-North Vernon, including a major deletion of nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method. 
Zimmerman cited constitutional concerns and described the method as “physically putting a mask over someone’s face and pumping nitrogen into their body.”
“Nitrogen hypoxia is not an acceptable method of carrying out the penalty of death,” he told the chamber.
The amendment ultimately passed 58-32 with bipartisan support.
The addition of a firing squad as an option remains in the bill along with lethal injection — the only method currently permitted in Indiana. The commissioner of the Department of Correction would choose the method used.
Firing squad, gas execution methods move out of House committee

 
Another amendment from Zimmerman would allow “at least one” media witness to be present during state executions, selected by the department.
Zimmerman said the change would increase transparency, noting that Indiana and Wyoming are the only states that don’t specifically allow journalists to be present at executions. Lucas said the amendment, which passed unanimously, “brings a level of reasonable and responsible transparency.”
Currently the only opportunity for an independent media witness is if the condemned inmate invites one.
Lawmakers also overwhelmingly adopted an amendment from Rep. Victoria Garcia Wilburn, D-Fishers, which expands mental health services for execution team members, including education on mental resiliency, warning signs of PTSD and state-funded treatment.
“People struggle with the long-standing trauma that accompanies taking someone’s life,” Garcia Wilburn said. “It goes against our God-given nature to take another human life.”
Two other amendments failed.
One proposal from Rep. Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne, would have similarly required professional psychological counseling for those who carry out Indiana executions and directed a study on firearm caliber for firing squads. 
Morris said it was “very disturbing” that former execution team members counsel current participants.
A different amendment offered by Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, sought to remove confidentiality protections surrounding lethal injection drugs and their sources.
“When a court sentences someone to death, it’s done in the name of all of us,” Pierce said. “I think that we should not try to keep secret from the people of the state what is being done in their name. We should know what kind of drug is actually being used and where it came from. That shouldn’t be some secret.”
Meanwhile, a Senate proposal authorizing firing squads effectively died after committee leaders declined to hold a vote to advance the measure to the full chamber.
The move to add firing squads is an attempt to deal with the high cost of pentobarbital used in Indiana’s execution process.

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation aimed at boosting residential construction and home ownership has won Indiana House approval despite concerns about limits it would place on local authority over housing regulations.
House members voted 76-15 on Tuesday in favor of House Bill 1001, advancing it to the Senate for action.
Provisions of the bill target housing affordability by limiting local zoning regulations and streamlining approvals for new residential development. It would prohibit local officials from actions such as imposing requirements on exterior design elements of homes unless a city or county adopts an ordinance to opt out of the limitation.
Bill author Rep. Doug Miller, R-Elkhart, said he would continue working with city and county officials to alleviate worries about the loss of local control.
But Miller argued communities must be open to “safe and affordable housing at every single price point.”
“Some construction standards are necessary for health and safety, but some may be outdated or impose unnecessary design elements that drive up cost, like prohibiting prefabricated materials, requiring certain facade treatments and disallowing certain roof products,” he said.
The legislation comes as various studies have found a growing housing affordability gap in the state.
Miller’s bill has the backing of Gov. Mike Braun and is a top priority for House Republicans this legislative session.
Rep. Chris Campbell, D-West Lafayette, was among those voting against the bill, citing its limitations on regulations decided upon by local leaders.
“Taking away that local decision is not good for my community,” she said.
House Speaker Todd Huston acknowledged there is still work to be done on the bill.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/85885E23-379B-4CF2-9220-780A41983558_1_201_a-1024x577.jpeg,,,2026-01-28 06:58:00.619622

A Tennessee Republican senator is proposing a constitutional amendment to shift local election dates to match federal elections.
Sen. Ferrell Haile of Gallatin is sponsoring Senate Joint Resolution 5151, which would place local government elections on the same day as federal and state ones in an effort to save money and increase voter participation, according to the resolution. House Majority Leader William Lamberth is sponsoring the House version with HJR729.
“The way it is now it just confuses folks terribly,” Haile said. He added that people often say they just voted and don’t understand why they’re going back to the polls a month or two later.
Primaries would be held in August and general elections on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Haile said meshing local, state and federal elections could solve voter apathy, as well.
For instance, in his Senate District 18 primary for the seat representing Sumner and Trousdale counties, the primary between him and Chris Spencer brought out only 14.5% of voters. The election between Spencer, a former Hendersonville alderman and co-founder of the Sumner County Constitutional Republicans, and Haile created significant conversation but failed to draw large numbers of voters to the polls in August 2024.
The Tennessee League of Women Voters isn’t taking a position on the matter until it studies the measure. 
Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett, whose office oversees elections, said he is “agnostic” on the legislation.
The historical argument against combining local and federal elections has been that races for seats such as county commission and sheriff would get lost in the hoopla surrounding congressional and presidential races. Haile, though, said he hopes moving the election dates would put more focus on local races.
Another criticism is that candidates for local seats would be forced to spend more money to send their message to voters.
The constitutional amendment would have to be approved in this session of the General Assembly and again within the next two years in another legislative session. Then it would go on the ballot for voters to decide and would have to receive a majority vote of those who participate in the gubernatorial election.
In addition, state Rep. Scott Cepicky of Culleoka is sponsoring HB1497, which would make all municipal elections partisan affairs, including those with metropolitan forms of government. Sen. Joey Hensley of Hohenwald is sponsoring the Senate version of the bill.
Tennessee has only three counties with metro forms of government, Davidson, Trousdale and Moore.

“The Pryor Center is honored to assist in the collection of these important oral histories of Arkansas service members,” Pryor Center Executive Director John Davis said. “The oral histories collected for this project will serve as testaments to the selfless service of these Arkansans and remind the rest of us of their sacrifice.”
Northwest Arkansas veteran housing project nearing completion

Thousands of Arkansans served in Iraq and Afghanistan from 2001-2021, and more than 100 died. 
The project will be led by Amy Schlesing, an award-winning former journalist who deployed seven times and spent several years embedded with combat troops while covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. 
“Arkansas is a small state, but a significant number of Arkansans served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,” Schlesing said. “This speaks to what makes our state special, where people put service before self. I’m honored to be a part of this project that will gather and preserve these stories of honor, service and sacrifice for generations to come.”
Oral histories will be gathered in phases, starting with soldiers with the Arkansas National Guard’s 39th Infantry Brigade, which deployed to Iraq in 2004 and 2008.
Veterans interested in participating in the project can email mystorymywar@gmail.com.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas is poised in July to become the first state in the nation to cut ties with PBS, a move that comes amidst cuts to federal funding for public broadcasting and public radio.
The PBS affiliate has already been rebranded as Arkansas TV, and officials say they’re preparing to launch in-house productions to replace Sesame Street, Masterpiece Theatre and other beloved programs.
But the decision has prompted skepticism from viewers who have relied on PBS for years as well as those who have given to Arkansas PBS.
Arkansas TV, formerly Arkansas PBS, plans to disaffiliate from federal agency after funding cuts

Here’s what to know:
 Why did Arkansas disaffiliate from PBS?

The Arkansas PBS Commission voted to cut ties in December after officials told the panel it was the only way to keep the network afloat.
Carlton Wing, CEO of what was formerly called Arkansas PBS, said disaffiliating would save the network $2 million a year. Chief Financial Officer James Downs said the network would have a $6 million deficit by the 2030 fiscal year if it remained a PBS station.
The network lost $2.5 million in programming and operational funds after the Corporation for Public Broadcasting lost federal funding last summer, and CPB officially shut down this month.
The commission voted 6-2 to cut ties with PBS. Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed three of the six commissioners who voted in favor.
One of those who voted in favor of disaffiliation was Maria Sullivan, whose husband Sen. Dan Sullivan is the Legislature’s most vocal critic of the public television network. He’s unsuccessfully pushed in recent years for abolishing the commission and cutting Arkansas PBS funding.
Wing told the Little Rock Rotary Club earlier this month that asking the state to give Arkansas TV more spending authority “is not realistic.” Wing was a Republican state representative before resigning to take the helm of Arkansas TV. The House has regularly struggled to have enough votes to pass the network’s appropriation bill.
Members of the public have pushed back against Wing’s claim that the state can’t give the network more money, citing Arkansas’ growing budget surplus.

 How can I watch Daniel Tiger and Ken Burns in Arkansas?

PBS KIDS shows such as Sesame Street, Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood and Clifford the Big Red Dog are all available for free on the PBS KIDS app.
Arkansans can subscribe to PBS Passport for $60 per year to watch a wide range of PBS programs such as Antiques Roadshow, Masterpiece Theatre and Ken Burns documentaries. However, the selection of Passport programs varies based on the viewer’s location.
Some viewers have asked Arkansas TV how they can watch PBS shows after the disaffiliation is finalized at the end of June.
Wing’s executive assistant, Katie Cramer, told one viewer that some PBS shows might be available to stream on Amazon, Hulu or YouTube services, in addition to the programs available online and on PBS apps.
 What is replacing Arkansas PBS?

Arkansas TV’s mission is to broadcast “more Arkansas stories, more Arkansas voices and more Arkansas experiences,” according to a December news release.

Public Comment 51 
The station has said viewers can expect several new shows along with the continued broadcast of BBC series that are distributed by American Public Television and the National Educational Telecommunications Association.
The station has already announced some programs ahead of disaffiliation, including a cooking show premiering in March called “Arkansas Taste Kitchen” with longtime TV and radio personality Craig O’Neill.
Some Arkansas-based content creators have already contacted the network about potential collaborations, according to emails the Arkansas Advocate received via a public records request.
Additionally, a children’s entertainment company from Australia contacted Arkansas TV expressing interest in the network distributing its content. Cramer said in her response that the “series could be a good fit for the programming we’re seeking.”
Interested parties can submit proposals to Arkansas TV via the “independent producer form” on its website.

(Photo by Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)I recently saw a bumper sticker on a car in McCall which read: “Don’t change Idaho, let Idaho change you.” It seemed like a plea from a long-time Idahoan to the thousands of people who have moved here to respect our state’s historic values and culture.
Unfortunately, it might be time to admit that this plea is too late. We just might have already lost the state many of us have known and loved. Many of the signs are there. 
Anyone who has lived in Idaho for a long time senses the visible change going on. The roads are choked with cars, especially in the fastest growing cities. Waiting for traffic lights to change, one notices many cars with Texas, California, Washington, and Oregon license plates. Drivers seem more impatient, and more likely to hit the horn for no reason at all. 
Land is being gobbled up for subdivisions previously used for farming and grazing. Apartments are springing up everywhere. Young families are experiencing ticket shock trying to buy their first house, prices driven up by newcomers who sold their house in Orange County or King County for a premium and pay cash for a new one in Idaho.
In mountain towns like McCall, which used to be considered the “real” Idaho get-away town, the second homes are getting larger and fancier. Subdivisions now dot places like Long Valley and Teton Valley.
There are other signs of change as well — in our politics and culture. Our politics have moved from our historic conservatism to a kind of radicalism that is hardly recognizable. The biggest spenders on lobbying and political campaigns are not from Idaho, but from out-of-state billionaires. Once there was a consensus that public education was a fundamental value – now our schools are threatened by privatization. In northern Idaho survivalists are building the “American Redoubt,” a highly armed last refuge against what they consider the coming Armageddon. A movement is afoot by a Christian nationalist church to take over the city of Moscow. 
For years, a public policy survey by Boise State University has documented these changes. Last week BSU’s 11th annual survey confirmed again that those who have moved into Idaho over the past 10 years are much more “conservative” — 53 percent — than those who have lived here 20 years or more – 41.9 percent. Only 17.1 percent of newcomers identify as “liberal” while 26.9 percent of longtime Idahoans identify as liberal. 
And while Donald Trump’s approval ratings are tanking, including in Republican states, the president’s popularity in Idaho has not slipped. Depending upon which report you read, Idahoans approve of Trump by 58 percent to 66 percent. This despite the president attacking our country’s longest and most loyal allies, coddling dictators like Vladimir Putin, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and declaring revengeful wars on any state that didn’t vote for him. 
Another troubling sign that we have entered a new political era is personified by two of our political leaders who, until Trump came along, represented Idaho’s best conservative, common-sense political values – Gov. Brad Little and Congressman Mike Simpson. Both Little and Simpson have enjoyed much bi-partisan support over the years. In 2018, when Little faced a tough three-way race for the GOP nomination, many Democrats and Independents registered Republican to vote for him and raised money for his campaign. 
But in his latest State of the State address Little wrapped himself around President Trump, praising him no less than 17 times. In 2025, Little signed a bill that would begin privatizing education in Idaho after Trump endorsed it, even though for years the governor said public education was his top priority. Last week he endorsed the federal voucher tax-credit promoted by Trump which will further privatize our Idaho schools. Now he talks about “education freedom,” more than how to improve Idaho’s poorly funded schools.
Little embraced the president so much in his State of the State that you’d think he was running for a position in the Trump cabinet instead of a third term as Idaho’s governor.
Then there is Mike Simpson who also enjoyed bipartisan support throughout his political career. Last week Simpson issued a guest opinion with a quote at the top in bold face that read: “Across the country, including in Idaho, left-wing agitators have taken to the streets to defend child sex offenders, drug traffickers, murderers, and other violent criminals, simply because they oppose a president who is actually enforcing the law. Let me repeat: these individuals are not protesters. They are agitators.”
I don’t know about the people in Minneapolis, but here in Idaho I’ve seen grandmothers and grandfathers, young couples pushing strollers, students, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, businessmen and women, cowboys on horses and patriotic Idahoans protesting the authoritarian actions of our president who as recently as last week said we need a “dictator” in America. If you don’t believe it, watch the video. 
These Idahoans, and millions of people like them, are exercising their constitutional right and duty as Americans to protest the actions of their government, just as Thomas Jefferson and the other founding fathers expected them to do if they believed their government had lost its way.
They are not agitators – they are patriots.
The real agitators are those who are moving our country toward authoritarianism and away from democracy and the ones who are silently complicit. 
I have been close to Idaho politics for more than a half century. I cannot imagine the great political leaders I’ve known personally, whether Republican or Democrat, would believe that moving toward authoritarianism and embracing a would-be dictator, conducting a war against our closest allies and our own people, would be what it means to be a patriotic American. But that is exactly what many of our Idaho political leaders are doing today.
Although Idaho has always been conservative, it has historically been the kind of conservatism that believes in education, community, and live-and-let live. It has been a state that wants to tax people only to the extent that it can provide the necessary services people want, especially education. But they always believed taxation was necessary for the sake of our state, its economy, and people, even enacting the sales tax in 1965 to support public schools. 
I’m sure the newcomers have moved here for many reasons which would be familiar to long-time Idahoans. Many probably moved here because of Idaho’s friendly people. Many probably moved here because of our public lands, where everyone can roam free. Many probably moved here because Idahoans hold an authentic faith, are devoted to family, community, and, most of all, to the golden rule, love your neighbor as yourself. 
These are the Idaho values that we should not change. These are the values that can unite Idahoans regardless of political affiliation. These are the values that our political leaders could and should reflect. But they will only reflect them if the people – natives and newcomers alike – demand it. 
“It is not by muscle, speed, or physical dexterity that great things are achieved, but by reflection, force of character, and judgment,” said Cicero, the Roman statesman who was one of the greatest influences on George Washington and our founding fathers.
It might not be too late, after all, to keep Idaho, Idaho. But it will require great reflection, strong character, and sound democratic judgment.

(Illustration: Getty Images)Tullahoma, a small city on I-24 between Nashville and Chattanooga, may seem like an unlikely place for a big First Amendment challenge, but for several years one has played out there — and mid-January brought a victory for free speech among high school students.
It all started in August 2022 when Tullahoma High School administrators suspended a student for posing three memes lampooning then-Principal Jason Quick. The student, identified only as “I.P.” in court filings, posted the images on his personal Instagram account the preceding summer.
The Knoxville News Sentinel posted the images on January 13, and they definitely fell into the “you’ve got to be kidding me” category for thin-skinned reasons to face school suspension.
The first shows Quick holding a box of vegetables with the caption “My brotha.” I.P. reposted it from his father’s home in Alabama during summer vacation. The second image, reposted during a family vacation to Italy, shows Quick as an anime maid with cat ears. The final image has Quick’s head superimposed over cartoon characters.
Thus, the 17-year-old just entering his senior year was suspended for three days, reduced from the original five, for violating school district policies against social media posts whether at home or school that “result in the embarrassment, demeaning, or discrediting of any student or staff” and another provision that prohibits social media activity “unbecoming of a Wildcat.” One certainly can argue both standards are indefensibly broad and fluid.
I.P. and family sued. Soon after the courts dismissed the case against Quick and another administrator as the school district agreed to expunge the suspension and repeal the policy. The court threw out eight of nine claims against Tullahoma City Schools, citing qualified immunity for the administrators. 
The one First Amendment claim, however, remained and was heard at the Howard Baker United States Courthouse in Knoxville. The jury ruled in favor of the student on January 15, but failing to see substantial injury awarded one dollar in nominal damages.
The Tullahoma case has many similarities to a recent lawsuit filed in Smith County by a Gordonsville High School sophomore. He is suing the board of education and two faculty members because he received a year’s suspension following comments he made on a personal Instagram account.
Since 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that “substantial disruption” of school activity should be the yardstick for when public school officials may discipline students for their expression. That substantial disruption test was re-affirmed by the Court as recently as 2021 when school officials were blocked from punishing a cheerleader for a vulgar Snapchat post. So, for example, a protest walkout during the school day would be a substantial disruption of the school day and the educational mission; wearing a protest ribbon for a cause likely would not be.
The Court, however, takes a very different approach to free speech when it comes to student publications. In a rather infamous 1988 case, Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier, a school principal, arguably the de facto publisher of the school newspaper, removed two pages from an edition of the paper because they contained articles about teen pregnancy and the effect of divorce on young people. The principal was concerned that even though students or parents were not explicitly named, enough identifying information existed to impinge on their privacy. The Court could have ruled, as the appellate court had, that the school paper had the qualities of a public forum — and the principal as an agent of the state had an obligation not to interfere. Instead, the Court sided with the principal’s argument.
In response, the Student Press Law Center has launched New Voices, a movement to change state law to offer greater protection to the student press. At last count 18 states have passed laws giving greater protection to student publications, and several more have bills in the works. Tennessee is not one of those states. The group has model legislation ready for our state and others to join in this effort.
Our legislature seems obsessed with beating up on migrants and following every whim of presidential aide Stephen Miller. It would be nice if our state lawmakers took a moment to expand on high school free speech and press by passing the New Voices legislation. If anyone wants to do so, we could call ours the Tullahoma Twist.

Supporters said House Bill 1417 would curb abusive lawsuits, but opponents worried it could weaken long-standing legal protections for Hoosiers.
The House Judiciary Committee voted 9-4 along party lines to advance the legislation authored by Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne. The bill now heads to the full House chamber.

As introduced, the bill proposed sweeping changes to Indiana tort law, including limits on noneconomic damages and new restrictions on lawsuits involving crimes on private property. 
But Chairman Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, said the bill needed to be scaled back.
“As it’s worded, it might be a little bit too big of a bite here, right out of the gate,” Jeter said before discussing amendments to eliminate certain provisions in the bill. 
The committee approved changes that stripped out large portions of the introduced bill, leaving only provisions related to public nuisance lawsuits and qualified settlement offers. Some of the deleted language would have barred injury lawsuits by ride-hailing passengers against transportation network companies like Uber or Lyft.
Lehman said what remains in the amended bill represents a narrower step forward after months of discussion about Indiana’s civil justice system.
“This will not solve all the issues I brought forth,” Lehman told the committee. “But I’ve committed, along with every stakeholder in this from both ends of the spectrum, to sit down over the next nine months and begin to not argue over their view … but find solutions so that moving forward, we have the right balance in our judicial system.”
Supporters cite ‘nuclear verdicts’
As amended, House Bill 1417 retains two core provisions: new limits on public nuisance lawsuits and a significant increase in the cap on attorney fees tied to rejected settlement offers.
The legislation rewrites Indiana law governing public nuisance lawsuits, limiting when those claims can be brought and what remedies are available. The bill defines a public nuisance as an “ongoing and unlawful condition” that interferes with an “established public right,” defined as the public’s use of land, air or water. Conduct permitted by local ordinances, state or federal law, or a court order would not qualify as a public nuisance, according to Lehman’s bill.
One attorney warned the bill’s narrow definition of public nuisance would have blocked major past litigation and recovery efforts, including opioid settlements, tobacco litigation and environmental contamination cases involving toxic chemicals.
Under the bill, governmental entities would, in most cases, be limited to asking courts to stop an ongoing nuisance and to recover only the costs needed to fix it — not money for possible future harms. The legislation would also limit defendants to facing just one public nuisance lawsuit for the same or nearly identical set of facts.
New business-backed alliance supports Indiana bill to reshape civil lawsuits, limit jury awards

The bill also raises the cap on attorney fees that may be awarded when a party rejects a qualified settlement offer and then obtains a less favorable judgment in court — from $5,000 to $100,000.
“If we really want to drive people to the settlement table, which is where they should go first, and not have a financial incentive to not do that, we need to raise this qualified settlement limit,” Lehman said. “The bill says $100,000. I support that.”
He noted that the legislation responds to rising litigation costs and what supporters describe as increasingly large jury awards.
“We’re seeing more and more investment from the outside to bolster and incentivize litigation,” Lehman said. “Report after report is documenting the rise in what is being referred to now as nuclear verdicts. These judgments have had a chilling effect on industry, including the insurance markets and liability coverage that are absolutely necessary for these entities to survive.”
Lehman emphasized, too, that the bill would not bar legitimate claims.
“We want to make sure we’re not closing the courthouse door to those who are harmed and entitled to restitution,” he added. “But we cannot continue to allow the balance to tilt against the innocent, against those who are being named in lawsuits with no ties to the incident.”
Former Senate President Pro Tem David Long, testifying for the newly formed Indiana Alliance for Tort Reform, said the group represents “a who’s who of business organizations throughout Indiana” concerned about legal uncertainty.
“There are some troubling signals appearing in and around the state of Indiana,” Long said. “They have some red flags out there that maybe threaten our future prosperity and some of the things that we’ve accomplished in the last two decades.”
Critics warns about unintended consequences
But trial lawyers and other opponents argued the bill could dramatically restrict long-recognized rights, including the ability of individuals — not just governments — to bring public nuisance claims.
“It’s been 180 years that Indiana has recognized the right of individual Hoosiers to bring a public nuisance lawsuit if they suffered a peculiar harm caused by a public nuisance,” said Scott Faultless, an Indiana attorney who testified in opposition.
“This takes that away greatly,” he continued. “This has a dramatic impact on individual rights to bring a public nuisance lawsuit if they are specifically harmed.”

Faultless pointed to lawsuits over the opioid crisis, chemical contamination in Monroe County and major industrial accidents — all cases involving widespread harm to public health that did not always begin as direct interference with public land, air or water.
“The opioid litigation was a public health crisis,” he said. “Underneath this definition of established public right — the use of public land, air or water — the opioid lawsuits would be completely impermissible.”
The lawyer also argued that the bill would eliminate a category of public nuisance claims that do not involve an explicit violation of law but have long been recognized by Indiana courts when lawful conduct nonetheless causes widespread harm.
Bob Johnson, president of the Indiana Trial Lawyers Association, additionally opposed the increase in the qualified settlement offer cap, calling it “excessive.”
“A six-figure exposure for rejecting a settlement offer … can place undue and disproportionate risk on plaintiffs and defendants who lack financial resources,” Johnson said. “It shifts from an incentive to settle reasonably into a tool that could be used as a punitive risk.”
Democratic lawmakers also raised concerns about how the bill could affect future cases involving opioids, tobacco or environmental contamination.
“I am concerned about … what that will do to those going forward,” said Rep. Maureen Bauer, D-South Bend, noting the importance of settlement funds for community reinvestment. “This doesn’t apply retroactively, and so when we look at some of these cases, like opioid settlements or tobacco settlements — or even vaping, where schools have been involved — what will that do to those going forward? That might be something to consider.”

They felt different. Not louder or quieter. Just heavier. The kind of weight you feel in the way students move through the building, in how they sit in class, in what they carry quietly with them.
I saw it in one sophomore in my family consumer science class. When I greeted him, he barely responded, eyes down, backpack half-unzipped—like keeping things together no longer mattered. 
That student lives with his grandparents, who are raising him, three siblings, and four cousins. His father is incarcerated and his mother left years ago. By the time he arrives at school, he has already shouldered responsibilities and emotional weight far beyond his years.
Later that day, I noticed another student, a junior, sitting alone by her locker, shoulders tense, eyes fixed on the floor. She recently lost a close family friend to gun violence. At home, grief and fear shape daily life, leaving little space for the routines of adolescence. 
This reality isn’t unique to my school. Across the country, students are struggling under invisible loads of trauma, anxiety, poverty, grief, and instability. 
Many sit in classrooms not only with textbooks and assignments but also with worries about food, housing, or safety. In Arkansas, the state with the highest prevalence, 56% of children have experienced at least one adverse childhood experience. 
When mental and emotional health are ignored, it shows up everywhere: in declining grades, rising discipline issues, and fading motivation. Mental health cannot remain an optional service; it must form the foundation so students succeed academically.
Trauma-informed training should be mandatory for all educators, with a focus on being proactive and anticipating needs of students based on how they act. This type of training has changed the way I teach, as I now see behavior as communication. 
The slumped shoulders and flat tone I saw from my student weren’t disrespect—they were exhaustion. Recognizing this was key; I checked in with him gently and then connected him with Cornerstone, the counseling service that partners with our district. Regular access to a counselor gave my student the space he needed to unpack what he had been carrying.
But training alone isn’t enough. Students must have access to counselors, and many schools simply don’t. The American School Counselor Association recommends a 250-to-1 student-to-counselor ratio, yet the national average is 385-to-1. The Arkansas average is 58% more students than the recommended number, which is 6% higher than the national average. 
In the Mineral Springs School District, a single counselor now serves roughly 395 students, leaving little time for preventive or ongoing support. When counselors are stretched this thin, they are forced to respond only to crises rather than building relationships that help students succeed. 
Consistent access to a counselor could mean learning healthy coping skills, receiving academic guidance, and getting support early, before stress, anxiety, or grief interfere with a students’ education.
Stability is healing. Yet in many schools, turnover among teachers and administrators is constant. In Arkansas, only about 76% of public school educators stayed at the same school between 2022–23 and 2023–24. At my school, that turnover means students finally open up to one adult, only to start over when that person leaves. Our students deserve adults who stay long enough to know their names, their stories, and their dreams.
Returning to teach at my alma mater has allowed me to maintain relationships year after year, showing students that someone who cares will always be in their corner. 
That means being the teacher who remembers who struggles with reading but lights up during science experiments, who notices when a usually talkative student goes quiet, who can say “I’ve known you since 6th grade; you can get through this.” 
It also means celebrating their first college acceptance letters, sitting with them after family losses, and holding them accountable because trust has already been built.
When students feel supported, the environment changes. Tension eases. Engagement returns. Joy doesn’t disappear from traumatized students; it waits for safety.
My students remind me daily that learning cannot be separated from living. If we want students to succeed academically, we must confront the realities they bring into our classrooms by investing in school counselors, committing to trauma-informed education, and retaining educators students trust. Our students are already carrying enough. It is time for schools and policymakers to start lifting it, so the green-and-gold hallways of Mineral Springs High School no longer feel heavy, but hopeful.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2192144566-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 06:58:00.619622

The bill tweaks the state’s Extreme Risk Protection Order law, also known as the “red flag” law, which allows a court to temporarily remove a gun from someone who is dangerous to themselves or others. In many instances, that process involves a suicidal person in crisis.

The 2019 law originally allowed law enforcement and family members to petition a judge for an ERPO and was then updated in 2023 to also let health care professionals, mental health professionals and educators to submit a petition. This year’s bill would add institutions like hospitals and schools to the list of petitioners, as well as behavioral health clinicians who co-respond with law enforcement.
“Many of those who were reluctant to be a part of the legislation in 2019 or weren’t in place at the time have now asked to be added to the list of petitioners,” said Sen. Tom Sullivan, a Centennial Democrat running the bill. “When we added health, mental health and education professionals to the list, we quickly heard that the institutions those professionals work for wanted to see how they could be included.”
Rep. Meg Froelich, an Englewood Democrat, is the House sponsor.
Objection: Second Amendment
Between 2020 and 2024, there were 692 ERPO petitions in the state, according to the state’s Office of Gun Violence Prevention. Six were filed by health care or mental health professionals. Judges granted 478 temporary orders and 371 final orders, which last for one year.

Shalyn Kettering, legal counsel to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, said that during her office’s travels around the state to educate people on the ERPO law, she learned there is a desire to “make it easier for those on the frontline to seek the protection of extreme risk protection orders and elevate those risks to the institutions for whom they work.”
Instead of a specific doctor’s or therapist’s name on the petition, it would list where they work. That is similar to how a law enforcement agency, versus an individual officer, can currently submit a petition.
Opponents said they see expansion of the ERPO law as further encroachment on Coloradan’s Second Amendment rights and worry that the law is akin to total gun confiscation. They also argued it could have a chilling effect on gun owners seeking medical care.
“This erodes trust between gun owners and medical providers,” said Ray Elliott, president of the Colorado State Shooting Association. He said the bill “would widen this divide, treating gun owners as second class citizens without equal (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) privacy or due process. Gun ownership is not a crime, and we must not normalize laws that presume guilt without evidence.”
The bill now heads the to full Senate for consideration.

(Photo by Avelino Gomez G via iStock/Getty Images Plus)You may have heard of the “garbage wars” of the late 1980s and early 1990s and think of them as the past. Private companies proposed massive landfills filled with out-of-state waste transported by West Virginia coal trains returning empty from East Coast cities. Our state would export coal to power big cities, and, in exchange, we would take their trash for mega-dumps, many proposed to contain more trash than our entire state produced. 
West Virginia would power the country and serve as the dumping ground for urban waste — an unfair exchange for our communities and a continuation of the extractive tradition of our state’s “resource curse.” Thankfully, environmental organizations and impacted community members refused to accept that fate and organized to demand action at the West Virginia Legislature. The result was the passage of the West Virginia Comprehensive Solid Waste Act in 1991 making it too costly for trains to transport and dump garbage on our land. Another positive outcome of this environmental organizing and advocacy was the creation of the West Virginia Division — now Department — of Environmental Protection, also in 1991. 
The 2020s bring a new era of “garbage wars” across our country in the form of so-called “advanced, or chemical, recycling.” This time, the garbage we face is plastic, and the industry claims it will clean up the land and waters of plastic pollution. In reality, advanced recycling will bring plastic waste from out of state to West Virginia for incineration into a fuel that requires significant refining to be useful in industry. Using a lot of energy and producing significant toxic waste, advanced recycling is greenwashing at the expense of West Virginia’s health and economy. 
In 2023, Clean-Seas West Virginia, a subsidiary of Clean Vision Corporation, signed an agreement with the state of West Virginia to build an advanced recycling facility near Belle in eastern Kanawha County. The company received $1.75 million in forgivable loans as part of $12 million in state incentives from the Economic Development Authority under Gov. Jim Justice’s administration. The next year, the company received a $15 million five-year bridge loan from the state. Despite these state handouts from our taxpayer dollars, Clean-Seas experiences mounting debt and likely brings false economic promises to the taxpayers footing their bill.
Clean Vision Corporation is a publicly traded company. This means anyone can view its and Clean-Seas West Virginia’s financial information through the Securities and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR database via annual and quarterly reports. Clean Vision Corporation’s  recent filings indicate weak economic viability, significant total debt at over $28 million, and negative shareholder equity. If I were responsible for attracting new business to our state, I would be extremely hesitant to hand out taxpayer dollars and benefits to a company with these financial statistics.
Clean Vision Corporation has a history of delayed business in the United States. It proposed an advanced recycling facility in Templeton, Massachusetts, which was present in the company’s 2023 filings, but not in 2025. At the end of 2024, residents of Templeton voted overwhelmingly to pass a one-year moratorium on new plastic incineration facilities for officials to study the potential impacts — this effectively halted the project. In 2022 Clean Vision engaged and co-located with MacVallee, LLC to secure mixed plastic feedstock from material recovery facilities and industrial suppliers, which was originally meant to work with the, now failed, Massachusetts site. In the 2025 third quarter report, Clean Vision indicates that MacVallee will provide the plastic feedstock from Massachusetts for incineration at the proposed West Virginia plant. Questions remain around how the material will travel to our state.
Even more, the SEC filings demonstrate a lack of transparency to the public. Clean Vision’s commitments regarding operation start dates and the amount of plastic the facility will “process” continue to shift. Since the facility’s announcement and press events with the governor’s office in June 2023, Clean Vision promised the public that the plant was expected to operate by the first quarter of 2024. By the 2023 annual filings filed late in April 2024, the operation date shifted to the second quarter of 2024. The next month in May 2024, the report indicated that the operation date was pushed back to the second quarter of 2025.
By the 2025 third quarter report, Clean Vision claimed that operations were expected to begin by the end of 2025, which never happened. The company’s application for an air construction permit, required before the facility lawfully operates, has not even been opened for public comment. Once it is, there will be at least 30 days before that comment period can close. In the earlier filings in late 2023, Clean Vision claimed it will convert 100 tons per day of plastic feedstock to begin with plans to expand to greater than 500 tons per day over the next three years, i.e. by 2027. Over time, and in official SEC filings, this claim shifted to only 50 tons per day. 
The lack of transparency and follow-through on promises made in the SEC filings and press releases to the public makes me leery that the company can be trusted at its word. Twice already, in October and December 2025, Clean-Seas West Virginia’s application for an air permit has been deemed incomplete by the state Department of Environmental Protection in email correspondence. West Virginians deserve better than this. 
Community organizing protected our mountains and waters from the impacts of mega-dumps over three decades ago, and it can do it again in the face of advanced recycling. Kanawha County residents have an opportunity to push back against this boondoggle and demand alternatives that will make our communities thrive.

(Photo by Getty Images)Virginia lawmakers on Tuesday advanced a bill creating a task force that would examine whether the Virginia Military Institute should remain a publicly funded, state-sponsored institution, marking the most consequential legislative step yet in a debate over the school’s governance and culture.
The proposal is part of a broader push by Democratic lawmakers to impose new oversight on VMI following a 2021 state-commissioned investigation that found persistent disparities, cultural barriers and a lack of accountability at the school.
VMI leaders have said they continue working with state officials to demonstrate progress and the institution’s value to the commonwealth.
Bills targeting VMI governance gain traction in General Assembly

The House Rules Committee voted along party lines to send the bill to the full House. If approved, the task force would be charged, in part, with determining whether VMI should continue receiving public funds as a state-sponsored military college.
Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, whose district includes VMI, voted against the measure but said he would participate constructively if it moves forward.
“I know VMI has had its challenges in the past. I know there have been mistakes made in the past at VMI, and I know that I, myself, as a legislator representing VMI, is willing to carry the (mantle) forward, to make certain that we correct those problems,” Austin said. “And whatever this study produces, we’ll do our very best to adhere and amend to that.”
Austin emphasized he wants to preserve VMI’s status as the oldest state-supported military institution in the nation. 
Public comments to the committee leaned heavily against the proposal, with alumni and parents urging lawmakers to maintain state support and pursue reforms without questioning VMI’s continued existence.
Stephen Johnson, a VMI alumnus and father of a current cadet, said lawmakers should focus on improvement rather than undermining the institution’s legitimacy. 
“VMI today is not defined by the nineteenth century or by the choices of earlier generations; it is defined by the young men and women it educates now, the standards it enforces now, and the leaders it produces for Virginia and the nation,” Johnson wrote in a letter obtained by The Mercury.
Several parents said the proposal has already created uncertainty among cadets and families, particularly over the possibility that VMI could lose state funding.
Michaela Smithley said her son chose VMI to follow his father’s legacy of service but fears the proposal threatens the stability of his education. She warned that transferring governance to another institution with a different mission would fundamentally alter VMI’s identity and set a precedent that any institution may lose its autonomy when it becomes politically inconvenient. 

Shortly after the start of the session, Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, introduced House Bill 1374 to dissolve VMI’s governing board and transfer oversight to Virginia State University’s Board of Visitors, who represent a historically Black college, close to 160 miles away.
“My child — and thousands like him — are not abstractions in a policy debate,” Smithley wrote in her public comment to lawmakers. “They are students who have already committed to serve, to lead, and to uphold the values of the commonwealth. They deserve stability, fairness, and confidence that the state they serve will not dismantle the institution they chose in good faith.”
Another parent, identifying herself only as “Menders,” testified that her son, a current cadet, called her in tears, worried he would be unable to afford his degree if VMI were to lose public funding.
“We are begging you to not change the education at VMI,” she wrote to lawmakers.
Other written testimony reflected more mixed views. 
Erin Tiede and Fred Fenster, parents of a gay cadet, said their daughter has not experienced discrimination and is evaluated solely on character and performance.
Former cadets Jeremiah Woods and Travis Korhorn offered sharply different assessments.
Woods, who is Black, supported the bill, citing racial targeting, a hostile environment and VMI’s continued glorification of Confederate identity. He said he left the school after his research related to a memorial for enslaved African Americans was suppressed.
Korhorn also backed the proposal, saying unresolved issues related to racism and sexism warrant formal review.
“VMI has some culture issues relating to racism and sexism,” Korhorn said. 
“I understand there was initiatives undertaken within the last few years to address these issues, but I am not privy to successes or shortcomings. I think HB 1377 would be a good initiative to review the aforementioned initiatives and provide recommendations for further improvement to the school.”
The task force bill is one of several measures aimed at VMI this session.
Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, who sponsored HB 1377, is also carrying HB 22, which would align VMI with policies used at other public universities by limiting disciplinary immunity for students who report acts of sexual violence.
Neither Feggans’ or Helmer’s bills had not been docketed as of Tuesday afternoon.
Feb. 17 is the final day the House can consider legislation that originated in the chamber. If approved by the House, the measures would advance to the Senate and, if passed there, to Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s desk.

Jen Kiggans of Virginia Beach and Rob Wittman of Westmoreland joined seven other members of Congress in pressing the administration of President Donald Trump for answers after a federal decision to pause offshore wind development, including Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project. 
In a letter to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the lawmakers called for greater transparency around the 90-day halt, which the Department of Interior said was prompted by national security concerns detailed in confidential reports.
“We respectfully request additional information on the analysis underlying the recent decision, including how radar interference, environmental tradeoffs, long-term subsidy exposure, workforce impacts, and broader national security considerations were assessed,” the letter read.
Dominion’s $11.2 billion project is nearing completion, with the first power expected to be delivered to the grid by the end of March, even with the temporary pause. Construction on the wind turbines resumed after nearly three weeks when a federal judge allowed work to move forward while court proceedings continue.
The initial order suggested the turbines could pose potential radar interference. In their letter, the lawmakers asked for the “evidence-based evaluation” that led officials to determine the pause was necessary. 
Once finished, the 176-turbine project is expected to deliver 2.6 gigawatts of power to the grid — enough to supply more than 660,000 homes — at a time when Virginia faces growing energy demand. 
Dominion has installed the first blades on the first full-scale turbine, beyond the two pilot  turbines installed in 2020. The company has repeatedly said the project was thoroughly reviewed for national security concerns.
“The project has been more than 10 years in the works, involved close coordination with the military, and is located 27 to 44 miles offshore, so far offshore it does not raise visual impact concerns. The project’s two pilot turbines have been operating for five years without causing any impacts to national security,” Dominion said in a statement following the 90-day pause announcement.
The lawmakers warned that additional delays to offshore wind projects nearing completion could threaten jobs and undermine grid reliability.
“Completing these projects according to plan is essential to achieving American energy dominance and strengthening our national security by reducing reliance on energy produced by our adversaries,” the letter said. 
“Offshore wind is also a critical component of the broader energy capacity needed to support advanced manufacturing and data infrastructure, including winning the artificial intelligence race.”

Pests, weather, uncertain markets and access to capital are a perennial problem.

(Photo by Getty Images)It’s not easy to be a farmer in Virginia. Pests, weather, uncertain markets and access to capital are a perennial problem. This year farmers have also had to contend with disruptions from President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs, and an immigration crackdown that has deprived many farms of their experienced labor force. 
 And then there’s climate change and the outward creep of suburban sprawl. No wonder studies show the number of farms in Virginia continuing to shrink, and the age of farmers still in business trending steadily upward. We are losing our family farms.
 That’s why I’m baffled by the resistance to solar in many parts of rural Virginia. 
Farmers who lease part of their land for solar earn a guaranteed, stable income for 25 or 30 years, keep the property in the family, and never have to watch as a subdivision paves over the fields where they played as children. The income from a solar project will be there when a late frost means the loss of that year’s fruit crop or a scorching summer reduces the corn harvest by half.
 Indeed, these days the choice is not between farming and solar; farming and solar are increasingly compatible “crops.” Sheep grazing has gotten the most attention in Virginia for its perfect synergy with solar: the sheep thrive in the shade of the solar panels and do the work of vegetation management, which otherwise would require herbicides and machinery. Elsewhere, farmers are raising cattle, poultry, grapevines and shade-loving crops under solar, in a practice collectively known as agrivoltaics.
 The combination of solar and agriculture is spreading rapidly across the country, endorsed by organizations like the American Farmland Trust. Solar sheep grazing is so popular that it has its own trade association, the American Solar Grazing Association. Here in Virginia, at least two sheep grazing companies contract with large solar developers for vegetation management. One, Gray’s Lambscaping, has over 800 sheep at solar projects, and expects to scale up to 5500 sheep by 2028. 
 Meanwhile, the conservation group Piedmont Environmental Council (PEC), which typically opposes large solar projects, is demonstrating the feasibility of growing vegetables under solar panels at a community farm in Loudoun County. 
 If solar integrates so well into the agricultural economy, what is the reasoning behind the county ordinances that ban solar or limit it to only a few projects? And why, when a county doesn’t prohibit solar outright, do local leaders so frequently reject permits for projects that meet all their conditions?  
 I’ve received emails from solar haters who regurgitate misinformation about the harms of solar panels, I’ve listened to legislators wax eloquent on the subject of “protecting rural values,” and I’ve sighed in frustration at a few fellow members of the environmental community who, when it comes to it, care less about addressing climate change than about keeping viewsheds pretty. 
 Often the opposition to solar is couched in terms of defending local control of land use decisions. But too many localities use this authority, not to make sure projects are developed responsibly, but to make sure they aren’t developed at all. And to that end, they prevent landowners from using their land in the way the owners have decided they need to. The rejections don’t mean the land returns to being farmed; more likely it means the land will be sold and, quite likely, developed for housing or even – gah! – data centers. If localities cared about saving farmland, they would approve more solar.
 In the last year, the percentage of utility solar projects that receive permits from localities ticked up slightly. One possibility is that the hostility to solar is easing. That would be welcome, but I suspect the more likely reason is that solar companies aren’t pursuing projects where they expect rejection. That’s a loss all around: the localities lose out on tax revenue, their landowners lose out on income, and everyone loses out on low-cost electricity.
 The hostility to solar makes little sense to me. Conservatives who care about property rights typically favor landowners over the government, so why is solar different? To be fair, some conservatives actively support solar, such as the groups Conservatives for Clean Energy and Energy Right.
 On the other side of the political spectrum, liberals and everyone else who cares about climate change should want solar everywhere – and most do, but not all. As for solar and farming, those of any political persuasion who care about farmland preservation should favor solar over subdivisions. And anyone who cares about the farmers themselves should be spreading the gospel of solar. Agrivoltaics is just the icing on the cake that can make everyone feel they didn’t have to compromise.
 The legislative response

 Legislators have struggled with this problem for several years now. Many are desperate for new clean energy projects to serve the fast-rising demand for electricity, but they’ve been unable to bring themselves to take authority away from recalcitrant localities. It’s a hard needle to thread.
 Last year members of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR) crafted a multi-part bill designed to give localities all the information they need to make rational decisions about solar permitting, while giving landowners and project developers a right to appeal adverse decisions to the State Corporation Commission (SCC). 
 That bill failed in committee, and this year only a part of it made it into a bill. House Bill 918, from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, sets up a university consortium to provide expertise and guidance, including on solar siting and permitting. 
 Meanwhile, a bill proposed last year by members of the solar industry came closer to passage than the CEUR bill did. The industry bill proposed a suite of rigorous best practices for solar, designed to reassure localities that solar facilities will be good neighbors. 
Among the best practices were farm-friendly provisions like using native pollinator plants, screening with native trees, and incorporating grazing animals or farm crops. Localities would not be allowed to ban solar outright, but would have to make decisions on the merits of each proposal. However, nothing in the bill would have required localities to approve these projects.
 The industry bill foundered last year, but this year it is back with the endorsement of CEUR. In its current form, HB 711 from Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, and Senate Bill 347 from Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, continues to preserve local decision-making, but localities that deny permits to solar projects must report their reasons to the SCC for inclusion in a public database. SB 347 has already been reported from committee and will be heard by the full Senate.
 Only one bill this year is directly aimed at helping farmers install solar. HB 1091 from Del. Amy Laufer, D-Albermarle, adds half a line to Virginia’s right-to-farm law giving farmers a right to install solar if they also use the same land for agricultural activities like grazing or crops.  The effect of Laufer’s bill is that any farmer who wants to combine solar and farming could do so without having to go get a local permit. (The right-to-farm law does not exempt farmers from other laws, so regulations governing erosion, wetland protection, etc. still apply.)
 A more modest bill, developed by PEC and carried by Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax, defines agrivoltaics and sets up an advisory panel to determine what qualifies, consider possible requirements and limitations, and make recommendations for next year. That’s encouraging, but unfortunately, the bill defines agrivoltaics specifically to exclude “solar energy generation that replaces the farmer’s primary income.”
Counterfactual definitions like this tend to cause problems. 
If a farmer has a crop failure, and the farm’s major source of income that year is solar, do they no longer qualify? It also suggests that sheep graziers in the business of using their animals for vegetation management at solar projects – i.e., agrivoltaics – could not use the industry-accepted word to describe what they do. Besides, really, don’t we want all solar projects to incorporate agriculture?
 A bill from Sen.David Marsden, D-Fairfax, would task the Department of Energy with setting up a committee of experts to develop solar siting criteria and then score the appropriateness of any proposed site for solar. There’s no indication in the bill that the criteria would include a farmer wanting to include solar among their products, but perhaps it could. However, it would not require localities to approve any projects. 
 It feels inevitable that the future of solar incorporates farming, and the future of farming may well mean incorporating solar. Whether Virginia’s leaders see this yet or not is another question, but they do have their opportunity this year.

Burt Jones, a Republican, launched his campaign for governor last year with a pledge to end the state's income tax. A special Senate committee he created has laid out a plan to do it by 2032. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderLt. Gov. Burt Jones is running for a promotion to governor, and he’s planning to use this session of the state Legislature as a stage for his campaign.
There’s nothing wrong with that, of course. That’s how the political system works. However, the proposal that Jones intends to make the centerpiece of his campaign – a plan claiming to eliminate Georgia’s state income tax – is irresponsible, unworkable and extremely misleading.
For proof, let’s turn to a report issued a few weeks ago by a Senate study committee appointed by Jones, explaining how the new tax plan would allegedly work. On its first page, the report makes a series of fantastic claims:

Over a few years’ time, the plan will totally eliminate the state income tax, which currently raises about $20 billion, or more than half of the state’s revenue.
The plan will “benefit every working Georgian equally.”
The plan “does not increase the sales tax nor create a state property tax, nor does it cut government services to Georgians.”

That raises a lot of questions, but the most basic is this:
Do you believe it is mathematically plausible to eliminate more than half of the state’s revenue, without cutting services and without raising other taxes, while benefitting all working Georgians equally? If your answer is yes, Jones has found the sucker that he’s been seeking.
If you cut more than half of your current revenue, but keep spending at current levels, basic arithmetic says you will have to look for new revenue from some other source. As a practical matter, that would inevitably mean raising the state sales tax. Other options might help around the edges, raising a few million here or there, but a significant sales tax increase would be absolutely necessary to close that revenue gap.
We also know something else with absolute certainty: Shifting the tax burden from the income tax to the sales tax would increase taxes paid by lower- and middle-income taxpayers while substantially cutting taxes for those with high incomes. That is not a rebuttable statement; it is basic math and well-understood tax policy. 
So while the Senate report styles itself as a tax-cut plan intended to help “financially struggling” Georgians, over time it does the opposite. It is a tax-shift plan, lowering the tax burden on financially thriving Georgians and increasing the tax burden on lower- and middle-income Georgians.
The Senate proposal attempts to disguise that impact in several clever ways. Initially, it would abolish the income tax only on the first $50,000 in income, or $100,000 for a couple filing jointly, while tapping the state’s current budget surplus to make up the lost revenue. 
That is intended to be merely temporary, however. The surplus will disappear fairly quickly, and in later years the income limits would disappear as well. At that point, the sales tax will have to increase and the true costs of the tax-shift proposal will begin to hit home for the vast majority of Georgians.
Think of it as a car salesman’s pitch:
“We’ll put you in this fine, beautiful car right here,” the salesman says, running his hand down the gleaming, candy-apple red hood. “You can drive it home today.”
“Well, it looks great,” you respond.  “But what are my payments going to be?”
“Not to worry. We’ll let you know about your payments two or three years from now,” the salesman says. “In the meantime, sign your name right here and I’lI grab those keys for you!”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_3922-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 05:58:08.046297

(File skyline photo from Getty Images.)Thousands of Haitians living in Ohio will lose their temporary protected status next week unless a federal court blocks it.
About 330,000 Haitians are living in the United States with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a program that allows people from specific countries in conflict or facing natural disasters the chance to live and work in the United States for a set period of time.
Haiti is currently plagued by gang violence and instability, with many fleeing the small Caribbean nation to the United States for their lives. Many of the refugees have no homes to return to in Haiti, and are fearful for their families’ safety if forced to return.
The Trump administration has set a date to end protected status for Haitians on Feb. 3, barring any action from a federal appellate court. This also means they will lose their work authorization, so they will no longer be authorized to work legally.

“At that point, they could potentially be arrested, detained, or put in removal proceedings unless they have already applied for some other form of relief they have in addition to TPS, or that they are applying for in addition to TPS,” said Emily Brown, Ohio State University Moritz College of Law’s Immigration Clinic Director. 
U.S. District Court Judge Ana C. Reyes will decide whether to suspend the expiration of the protected status for Haitians and her decision is expected Feb. 2. 
About 30,000 Haitians with temporary status live in central Ohio and an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 Haitians call Springfield home, with a mixture of temporary protected status, citizenship, and other legal status.
“The folks are fearful,” said Viles Dorsainvil, executive director of the Haitian Support Center in Springfield. 
“They came here just to work and send their kids to school and be here peacefully,” said Dorsainvil, who came to the United States from Haiti in 2020. 
“All of a sudden, they find themselves in another scenario where they’re not accepted… They are panicked and the worst thing is that they can’t even plan their lives for three months down the road.”
Haitians with temporary status could apply for asylum, Brown said. 
“If they have a pending asylum application… they have the right to apply for work authorization and to not be removed while they’re waiting for their application to be pending,” she said.

However, the Trump administration put an indefinite freeze on processing all asylum applications at the end of 2025. 
“There’s a lot of concern that people may be put in detention while they’re waiting for their asylum hearings, and be taken away from their kids, their work, and their homes,” said Ohio Immigrant Alliance Executive Director Lynn Tramonte. 
Haitians were initially granted temporary protected status after Haiti’s earthquake in 2010 killed 222,570 people. The Biden administration extended Temporary Protected Status to Haitians in 2021 after the assassination of Haiti President Jovenel Moïse. 
Gang violence, political instability, and hunger make it unsafe to return to Haiti.
“A lot of people are afraid for their lives if they return to Haiti, so a lot of people are not just going to get on a plane and go to Haiti,” Brown said. 
“Most people, I think, are staying and just trying to take their chances and see what happens. It’s difficult to uproot your whole life like that, particularly when you’re not sure where else to go because it’s not safe to go back to Haiti.”
Tramonte said it breaks her heart how Haitians have been looking for safety for years. 
“When do Haitians get to just stop running?” she asked. 
Some Haitians are going to Canada if they have a family member there, but many Haitians living in Springfield do not have any other alternatives, Dorsainvil said. 
“Nowhere is safe right now,” he said. 
There are concerns that protected status ending for Haitians could lead to an uptick in Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity. 
“My guess is that … ICE is going to be looking at areas of the country — including Springfield (and) parts of Columbus — where they know that large numbers of Haitians are here, and they’re going to be engaging in racial profiling,” Brown said.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who was born in Springfield, has said often talked about how the Haitian people are contributing to Springfield’s economy. 
“They are reliable,” DeWine told reporters in December. “They show up, they work, they want overtime, they’re reliable, and they pass drug tests.” 
Mike and his wife Fran DeWine help support the Becky DeWine School in Haiti, named after their late daughter, but the school had to close due to gang activity in 2024.  
Springfield Mayor Rob Rue is “not providing interviews on this matter at this time,” a spokesperson for the mayor said in an email response to the Capital Journal.
The Haitian Support Center director agrees with DeWine about the impact on the local economy if Haitians are forced to leave.
“If it happens that those folks leave here, I think it will be felt economically (in Springfield),” Dorsainvil said.
Springfield was in the national spotlight during the 2024 Presidential election when Vice President J.D. Vance started the false claim that Haitian immigrants who have moved to Springfield were eating cats and dogs.
DeWine and state public safety officials debunked the claim, but President Donald Trump repeated the claim during a national debate.
That led to bomb threats against Springfield schools and City Hall, as well as threats of violence toward public officials and business owners, and neo-Nazis protesting in the city.

(Photo by Douglas Sacha/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — The number of smokers in South Carolina has dropped in recent years, but the state could do more to discourage tobacco use, according to a report from the American Lung Association released Wednesday.
With federal cuts to nationwide smoking deterrent programs, the lung health association warned that hard-won decreases in the number of adults and teenagers who smoke could backslide unless states step in to make up the difference.
“Last year was a devastating year for tobacco prevention and control policies,” said Danna Thompson, who oversees the association’s policy pushes for a handful of Southeastern states, including South Carolina.
“It’s really on the state to take action to prevent and reduce tobacco use,” Thompson said.
An estimated 12% of South Carolinians smoked as of 2023, according to the most recent data available from the state health department. More than three decades prior, in 1992, that number was 27%, according to historical data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A much bigger decrease came from teenagers who smoke. In 2021, a quarter of high school students surveyed reported having used any sort of tobacco product, including 21% who used e-cigarettes regularly, according to the state health department.
That dropped to 10% of students in 2024, the most recent data available, with 9% saying they smoked e-cigarettes.
Federal and statewide initiatives contributed to those drops, Thompson said.
But federal budget cuts last year gutted the Office on Smoking and Health, which ran anti-smoking ads, promoted hotlines to help people looking to quit and created resources on the harms of smoking. Unless Congress restores the office’s staff and funding, states will likely have to make up the difference in resources and funding from the office, Thompson said.
“These actions weaken enforcement,” Thompson said. “It risks reversing years of declining tobacco use and really has hindered many state and local efforts.”
Tobacco prevention program spending
One way of doing that would be to put more money into programs discouraging the use of cigarettes and vapes, according to the report.
South Carolina’s health agency has nearly $7 million to spend on reducing tobacco use during the fiscal year that ends June 30, the report found. That goes toward resources to support people trying to quit smoking, including a 24/7 helpline, one-on-one coaching and free non-prescription medications, such as nicotine gum, through the state’s Tobacco Quitline.
The association wants an additional $5 million, doubling the amount the state typically spends on reducing tobacco usage. State spending increased in recent years with an influx of cash from a settlement with e-cigarette company Juul, which is required to pay the state just over $11 million by the end of 2031, at the latest.
The suggested $5 million could more than offset any potential loss of federal funding in the face of an uncertain future, Thompson said.
“We know that making these investments in tobacco prevention and control is a proven way to reduce people starting to use tobacco and nicotine products and as a means to help them quit,” Thompson said.
More than 13,300 people called the hotline in 2024, the most recent year of data available, according to the North America Quitline Consortium, which oversees similar hotlines for every state. Nearly 6,600 South Carolinians received services through the program that year.
That program is “amazing” in getting smokers treatment, said Beth Johnson, a lobbyist for the South Carolina Cancer Action Center.
“If you talk to most smokers, they want to quit tobacco,” Johnson said. “But they sometimes need a little extra help because, of course, we’re looking at nicotine, which is a very addictive drug.”
The state also offers resources, including for schools, meant to educate people on the harms of smoking. Like in the country as a whole, smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disease in South Carolina, according to the report. Smokers are at a heightened risk of lung cancer, heart disease, strokes and diseases that cause breathing trouble.
Telling people about the risks of smoking and vaping is one goal of Smokefree SC, a Columbia-based nonprofit that supports anti-smoking organizations across the state.
In years past, the organization received just under $700,000 from the state health department to fund educational talks in schools, called “vape talks,” as well as grants to smaller local nonprofits and training sessions for adults, said Barbara Derrick, Smokefree SC’s executive director.
The state contract ended in the fall of 2025, amid the federal cuts to tobacco reduction programs, she said. Since then, the nonprofit has kept up its work using what’s left over of a $1 million earmark it received two years ago, she said.
More money would mean more “vape talks” for students, parents and teachers, Derrick said. Last year, the nonprofit’s two community outreach workers did 40 total talks that reached nearly 4,000 people.
“It’s a constant battle to counteract (vaping), and it’s one that we still fight,” Derrick said.
The CDC recommends South Carolina spend $51 million based on its population and the number of smokers it has, according to the report. Only one state, Maine, matches the CDC’s funding recommendation, which certainly won’t make it into South Carolina’s budget.
Cigarette tax
To keep people from accessing cigarettes and other tobacco products, the report recommends the state increase its tobacco tax.
South Carolina still has one of the nation’s lowest cigarette taxes, at 57 cents per pack of 20 cigarettes. Only four states have lower cigarette taxes, including neighboring Georgia and North Carolina, other major tobacco-growing states historically.
During the last fiscal year, the cigarette tax brought in nearly $114 million, according to the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. When legislators passed the increase, they also designated where the money could go, spending $5 million annually to prevent and reduce smoking, $5 million for cancer research and the rest on Medicaid costs.
In a state focused on cutting taxes, increasing one seems highly unlikely. The cigarette tax hasn’t increased since that 2010 law, when legislators overrode a veto from then-Gov. Mark Sanford to raise the tax by 50 cents. And that was the first increase in cigarette taxes in 33 years.
Making cigarettes more expensive is an effective way to get cigarettes out of the hands of teenagers and people in poor, rural areas, who are often more likely to smoke, Thompson said.
She also advocates for taxing e-cigarettes the same as tobacco cigarettes. Though e-cigs (or vapes) have nicotine, they don’t have tobacco, so they aren’t taxed like regular cigarettes, as defined by state law. There are no specific taxes on e-cigs in South Carolina.
Raising taxes on cigarettes and vapes would be more effective than creating a registry of e-cigarettes, as a bill working its way through the Legislature would, she added.
Proposed as a way of getting vapes out of the hands of children and teens, a Senate bill the House passed last week would form a list of products with approval or pending approval from the Food and Drug Administration that stores in the state could sell.
The idea is to standardize what the state can or can’t sell in an effort to crack down on sales of illegal fruit- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes popular among students, legislators have said.
The American Lung Association contends the bill will not actually help quell vaping among school children and state resources are better spent on other prevention efforts.
“It is not moving the needle,” Thompson said.
After the House’s vote of 66-33 to pass the bill, it went back to the Senate, which can agree to changes the House made or send the bill to a conference committee, where the two chambers hammer out their differences.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1314998931-700x467-1.jpg,,,2026-01-28 05:58:08.046297

But none seem as stark as Gen Z where political shifts are straining romantic and platonic relationships. (Getty illustration by Anton Vierietin) In recent years, young men and women in Generation Z have moved in opposite political directions, producing a gender gap unlike any other generation before. Young men have increasingly leaned towards the conservative, Republican party while women have moved towards the liberal, Democratic party. While gender gaps are a feature in every generation, none have been as stark as Gen Z. 
Who is the main driver? Women. They are now the force pushing Gen Z towards the left politically and socially, and becoming increasingly more civically active compared to any other generation. There are divides not just about how they feel about political candidates, but cultural issues which could deeply affect America.

Generation Z, which I am a part of, is the cohort born between 1997 and 2012. My generation has been shaped by rapid technology growth, social media, witnessing financial crises, wars, and climate change. 
Contrary to the conventional wisdom that young voters support progressive candidates and policies, in the most recent presidential election, men between the ages of 18 and 29 showed immense support for the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. However, women have become a cohesive force for the Democratic party, with about 65% voting for Biden in 2020 and Harris in 2024. 
This gender divide is complex, rooted in differences in politics and social issues. In terms of politics, only 26% of Gen Z women approve of the job that Donald Trump is doing in office compared to 47% of Gen Z men. On the question of abortion, 76% of women believe that abortion should be legal, whereas 59% of men believe it should be legal.
Women’s activism is now amplified by the fact that we make up around 60% of college students, contributing to the trend that higher educated individuals tend to be liberal. With greater access to higher education and economic opportunity, women are now more empowered to play a larger role in political activism and voting, while men have fallen behind women in civic engagement. 
Alongside this increase in engagement, there is the fact that women’s rights are being increasingly threatened under the Trump administration. After movements like #MeToo and the fall of Roe v. Wade, many women feel a sense of urgency and personal investment, whereas Gen Z men don’t have the same sentiment. Moreover, this reflects both differences in priorities and experiences. 
Many men feel that their rights and lifestyle are being infringed upon so they seek validation from communities online. The feeling of losing influence in many aspects of society has led them to turn to misogynistic social media influencers like Charlie Kirk, Andrew Tate, or Adin Ross who have created a mass following. They have become pillars of hypermasculinity and misogyny by promoting hate and violence against women. 
Additionally, these influencers have become prominent recruiters for the right wing Republican party by framing politicians like Trump as an empowering figure who will restore male power. With social media algorithms and echo chambers, podcasters, YouTubers and other online influencers, can easily engage young men and boys — some as young as middle school — to promote conservatism rooted in male dominance, and a community of men who have common ground.
Algorithms turn everyday interests like fitness, relationships, and gaming into gateways to the manosphere. They thrive on male loneliness and insecurity about themselves and the world around them and move the blame to women.
These political shifts also go beyond just political candidates, they have put a strain on romantic and platonic relationships, as women and men are no longer spending time together, rather they are spending time in their separate echo chambers — creating their own sense of reality on social media. As young men are holding onto the belief in more traditional gender roles and family structures, Gen Z women are valuing independence, their careers, and progressive reform.
As a member of Gen Z, I have experienced this divide. I and many other women my age have become concerned with issues like abortion, the environment, gun laws, and equality while many of our male counterparts don’t feel the same or prioritize other issues. 
Why is this important? Who does it affect? It is important because this signals deepening polarization that has shown to put a strain on relationships. As Gen Z becomes older, there will be less social cohesion and greater risks to democratic consensus. With the effects of social media algorithms and echo chambers, there will be irreversible polarization and instability. 
Polarization has effects on housing, jobs, welfare, social relationships, mental health, and families.
What can we do? In short, educate.










As Gen Z becomes older, there will be less social cohesion and greater risks to democratic consensus. With the effects of social media algorithms and echo chambers, there will be irreversible polarization and instability.


As Gen Z, we can develop our media literacy and learn to combat misinformation. Introduce media literacy in school curriculum; parents can educate their children on media influence — young boys about misogynistic language and media, and young girls about self-confidence. We can foster better empathy and understanding for personal gender struggles including women’s underrepresentation and hardships and men’s mental health struggles. Men with large platforms must promote equality, emotional intelligence, and mental health resources. We can focus on common struggles that we have experienced like economic opportunities, housing, and anxieties about the future.
Understanding the causes and consequences of this political and social split helps us navigate the lasting effects of social media, misinformation, the need for education, and relationships. Ultimately, Gen Z’s historic gender divide is not a myth, but a tangible reality shown in activism, ideologies, and voting across the country. 
As a generation, we can work towards a better cohesive force that focuses on growth and positive change.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-28 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Will CT pass AI legislation this year?,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/28/artificial-intelligence-regulation-senate-lamont-ct/,"CT lawmakers haven't settled on how to regulate artificial intelligence. Since they adjourned in 2025, the question has become more pressing.","When Connecticut lawmakers exited the state Capitol at the end of the 2025 session, they left behind some unfinished business, particularly around the state’s plan for regulating companies’ use of artificial intelligence, ensuring data privacy and establishing consumer protections around emerging technologies. 
For a second year in a row, legislators were unable to agree on the direction of state AI policy, with pro-regulation lawmakers in the state Senate and the more regulation-shy Lamont administration disagreeing over the best course of action.   
In the months since, the question of what Connecticut should do about AI has only become more pressing. In December, the Trump administration issued an executive order in the hopes of discouraging states from regulating the technology. Meanwhile, a growing number of businesses are incorporating artificial intelligence into their operations, and investment in the global AI market has reached hundreds of billions of dollars.
Without federal legislation, state legislatures — in Connecticut and elsewhere — are facing pressure to address everything from the ethics of AI use to the environmental impact of data centers and concerns over a dot com-like “bubble.” 
And as “generative AI” — programs that use datasets and already-available information to power technologies like ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Microsoft’s Copilot — is increasingly used in everyday life, the task facing regulators is only getting more complicated.
So far, few states have reached common ground on how to write the rules.
Pro-regulation lawmakers have proposed a wave of new measures, arguing that guardrails on the rapidly-changing technology will provide necessary protection to constituents worried about losing their privacy and intellectual property.  
Opponents say the ever-growing list of AI “dos and don’ts” could have a chilling effect on local economies, curbing AI adoption and encouraging technology companies and innovation-focused businesses to move to friendlier markets.
In Connecticut, the debate is unfolding just as state economic development officials launch multiple efforts to invest in artificial intelligence and emerging technologies, likening the initiative to a second industrial revolution. 
With the 2026 legislative session quickly approaching, state lawmakers believe that the coming months provide a chance to define how Connecticut will approach the technology moving forward. Leaders of last year’s regulation efforts say the state can’t afford to miss its next chance.
“There’s definitely a debate over how strong our AI laws should be,” said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk. “But I will tell you that if you talk to average people on the streets, they’re very concerned about AI and how it’s going to impact them.”
Lawmakers are gearing up for another swing at AI regulations
The Connecticut General Assembly’s record on passing AI-related measures is mixed. In recent years, state lawmakers have been able to push through a number of proposals, including data privacy regulation, new funding for AI training and education programs, and the criminalization of deepfake revenge porn. 
Efforts to pass comprehensive legislation have been harder to get over the finish line.
Take Senate Bill 2, a wide-ranging proposal that sought to regulate how businesses use artificial intelligence in various ways, calling for the Department of Economic and Community Development to create a “regulatory sandbox” and seeking to limit the effects of algorithm-based discrimination. The bill was supported by Democratic leadership in the state Senate, and first emerged in 2024 after a state task force released a 255-page report on AI. 
Gov. Ned Lamont opposed the bill, arguing that the measure would contribute to a fractured landscape of state AI regulations. State officials also suggested that lawmakers were acting too early, potentially scaring off future innovation in Connecticut. 
Ultimately, S.B. 2 was amended to remove many of the business-related provisions and completely pulled references to algorithmic discrimination. While the amended bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support, the measure did not receive a vote in the House before the end of last year’s session. 
For supporters of the legislation, the failure was frustrating, especially after last-minute amendments shifted the bill away from some of its original intent for the sake of broader appeal. “The bill had changed and become, I would say, more scaled back in the protections,” said state Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford, the author of Senate Bill 2 and a leading voice in the legislature on data privacy and AI. 
“By the end of last year, [S.B. 2] was more of a disclosure bill, to use if AI was being used to make an important decision about your life,” he said. 
In a December interview with the Connecticut Mirror, Maroney outlined his views on the state’s AI needs. He noted that he is far from an opponent of artificial intelligence, instead casting his desire for regulation as supporting the guardrails that will help structure the state’s future innovation efforts. 
He said last year’s proposal would have provided those guardrails by accomplishing a multifaceted goal: “protecting” state residents, “promoting” responsible AI development, and “empowering” state government to use AI in ways that will benefit constituents. 
Senate lawmakers intend to continue their efforts to “protect, promote, and empower” this year, planning a package of data privacy and consumer protection reforms alongside support for AI training and workforce development. One such bill has already been announced: a ban on facial recognition software in retail stores. 
Both Maroney and Duff, the bill’s expected sponsors, said the measure was inspired by news that Wegmans Food Markets, a popular grocery chain, is using facial recognition software at some of its locations, including in its New York City grocery store. While the company said it’s not sharing the data with any third parties, the news still sparked concern over the use and storage of biometric data.
“The facial recognition and the biometrics and voice recognition, I think, are issues that are really much different than a camera looking for a shoplifter,” Duff said. 
The bill’s sponsors say they hope to enact the ban before facial recognition software becomes widely used in the state. Earlier in January, reporting from CT Insider found that ShopRite, a New Jersey-based grocery chain with several locations in Connecticut, was using facial recognition software in several local stores.

As new legislation comes into shape,  businesses in CT are wary 
A spokesperson for the governor said he wants to focus on regulations that “protect the privacy and safety of Connecticut residents.” 
“Governor Lamont continues to be supportive of any measures that protect the safety of residents when using AI, as well initiatives to upskill AI research and job training,” Rob Blanchard, Lamont’s spokesperson, said in an emailed statement. “While the federal landscape surrounding AI regulation continues to evolve, the Governor will continue to prioritize safety and education.” 
State lawmakers who support regulating AI and data privacy told the Connecticut Mirror that their efforts are about ensuring state residents can engage with artificial intelligence on their own terms. In their view, regulation is both commonsense and necessary, and does not have to result in serious negative impacts for local businesses.
Some business leaders see things differently. The Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the state’s largest trade group, has been critical of efforts to strongly regulate AI use, arguing that at a time when the economy is stagnant, energy and other costs continue to impact companies, and small business owners voice concern and frustration over the state’s business climate, new AI policy could hinder innovation. 
The adoption of new regulations on businesses, “puts us at much more of a risk of being a less business-friendly state, and can really impact investment in the state, and the ability for small businesses to want to operate here in the state,” said Chris Davis, CBIA’s vice president of public policy. “That can really hinder willingness to take advantage of the beneficial sides of artificial intelligence, the efficiencies that improve productivity and increase tax revenue for the state and really grow our economy.” 
Davis said his concerns largely boil down to three points. First, there is a concern that proposed regulations in the state are blurring the lines between artificial intelligence and data privacy, creating a consistent “creep” of new regulations. 
Next is the question of how the state might enact and enforce policies, particularly algorithmic discrimination and the use of impact assessments to track business employment outcomes.
Research has found that because of how AI gathers and uses already available information, some of which can contain biased and inaccurate data, AI systems can produce outputs that reinforce discrimination against marginalized communities. That can cause harm to people based on their age, race, and gender. Debate around the topic is currently making its way through the courts as a lawsuit, Mobley v. Workday, which challenges some AI-based hiring systems as being discriminatory.
Concerns over AI bias were a component of last year’s legislative debate, with some lawmakers arguing that failing to address algorithmic bias would leave a massive “hole” in any state legislation.
Addressing algorithmic bias has proven to be a major focus in statehouses; measures in more than 20 states were introduced in 2025. 
The push to address algorithmic discrimination through specific and repeated assessment was of particular concern to businesses in Connecticut, Davis said, because it suggested that “every business is discriminating unless they can somehow prove that they’re not.” Davis said federal policy and state law — the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act, in particular — already require businesses not to discriminate.
Ultimately Connecticut lawmakers removed references to algorithmic discrimination from last year’s bill. 
Davis’ final concern is the direct result of the other two: that by creating a wave of new regulations and then requiring businesses to keep track of how they are complying with them, the state could inadvertently limit AI growth by creating a system that is overly complicated, expensive and mired in paperwork. 
Some of these concerns, along with a growing business interest in having input on new state policies, are part of why CBIA recently launched a Technology Council, a group that will review and offer business industry perspectives on proposed state technology policy. The group is expected to be active in the coming year. 
Davis declined to discuss the pending facial recognition bill or other possible legislation that could emerge in the session, noting CBIA would prefer to comment after bills are introduced. Still, he said he hopes lawmakers will avoid enacting anything too rigid so that businesses have flexibility.
“We’re in a situation where we need to be able to find ways to be more productive and more efficient here in the state,” he said. “And AI has that opportunity.”

States are leading the way on AI regulation. The federal government wants to change that.
Asked about the ideal form of AI regulation for the business community, Davis said business and industry concerns are largely rooted in the piecemeal nature of state action. If each state adopts differing levels of regulation around AI and data privacy measures, that would make it difficult for businesses and consumers alike to navigate issues across state lines.
More specifically, there is concern that Connecticut could end up on the stricter side of the regulatory divide, and that companies looking for looser standards might move somewhere else. This is part of why S.B. 2 proved controversial last year, and was a factor in why the pro-business Lamont voiced his preference for other states to take the lead on adopting AI regulations.
The earliest adopters of comprehensive AI regulation have also run into their own troubles. 
Colorado — for one — has emerged as a sort of national test case. In 2024, the state enacted the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act, a comprehensive regulatory measure that addressed algorithmic discrimination. The law was the first broad measure approved at the state level, and the Colorado bill has been viewed as a model that could potentially influence other states looking to adopt regulations. 
The fairly new law continues to be a source of controversy ahead of its expected implementation later this year, with supporters and opponents remaining at odds as the state braces for higher than expected implementation costs. Colorado lawmakers are currently looking to revise the law in the current 2026 session. 
The continued discussion and delays in Colorado offer an early lesson: that lawmakers in other states will need to establish a variety of technical standards, from concise regulatory definitions, to easily navigated financial frameworks, and clearly-structured review processes for businesses if they hope to adopt comprehensive AI regulation. 
At this point, many states seem more interested in adopting smaller, more incremental bills over large legislative packages. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, almost every state considered an AI or consumer privacy bill in 2025, with further action expected in statehouses this year. 
For now, Connecticut also seems likely to take a more targeted approach in 2026, and early discussions at the start of the session seem likely to focus on data privacy.
“Whenever you bring up privacy issues, there’s a lot of things that we can talk about,” Duff said.
As Connecticut lawmakers work through these questions, the federal government is looking to have its own say on state AI efforts. The Trump administration’s December  executive order warned states away from AI regulations, arguing that a patchwork of regulation could negatively affect interstate commerce. The administration instead supported a “carefully crafted national framework”, a singular federal standard establishing national rules on AI and related consumer protections.
The order also threatened to pull back leftover broadband deployment funds from states that have passed “onerous” laws around AI. 
The executive order arrived months after a previous effort to curtail state AI efforts failed in Congress, with lawmakers removing a proposed ten year moratorium on state AI regulations from an earlier version of the president’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act over the summer.

Still, federal efforts to cut off state legislation may not have much of a chance. “A lot of the things in the executive order are — I don’t want to say they’re not enforceable, but they don’t actually do that much,” said Gowri Ramachandran, the director of elections and security for the Brennan Center for Justice, a legal and policy think thank housed at New York University’s School of Law. She notes that state AI laws are likely on solid legal ground, adding that the administration lacks the power to directly take legal action against state measures. 
In Connecticut, lawmakers supporting new regulations say that in the absence of federal leadership, it is up to states to help put boundaries on artificial intelligence technologies. “Based on past precedent, there will not be a national standard,” said Maroney, who joined Duff and other state lawmakers in signing a letter criticizing the president’s AI executive order last month. “We haven’t seen any federal laws between 1998 and last year.” 
And as AI technology stands to see increased adoption in the near future, legislators say waiting any longer would be a mistake. 
“By not addressing or regulating in some way, shape, or form artificial intelligence, we make the same mistake that we did 30 years ago, when we did not put any kind of regulation or boundaries around the internet,” Duff said. “That’s a mistake to our society, to our country.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7489-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-28 05:58:08.046297

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As lawmakers convene for this year’s state legislative sessions, immigration has surged to the top of the agenda. Across the country, dozens of bills touching on immigration enforcement, civil rights and the role of federal agents have been introduced this month.
The proposals range from measures that would restrict where federal immigration agents can operate, to bills creating new legal pathways for residents to sue those agents, to proposals that would shield agents from having their personal information disclosed publicly.
The volume and scope of the legislation reflect growing political momentum and tension around immigration at the state level — even as many of the bills face long odds of advancing. Immigration enforcement is primarily a federal responsibility, and states historically have had limited authority to shape who can remain in the country. But lawmakers are acting where they can.
“There is important space for state officials to decide to what extent they are going to use state resources to enforce immigration law, or on the flip side, create a more welcoming environment for migrants in their communities,” said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University.
The flurry of legislation is unfolding amid the Trump administration’s intensifying immigration crackdown and a rise in protests over enforcement operations. In Minneapolis this month, federal agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, during protests –– fueling national outrage and scrutiny of federal enforcement tactics.
Those shootings have also deepened public mistrust, as federal authorities’ accounts of what happened don’t match what is shown in publicly available video footage and documents. The discrepancies have become a flashpoint for lawmakers pushing for greater oversight of federal agents operating in their states.
A surge of bills
The purpose and scope of immigration-related bills vary widely.
Footage, documents at odds with DHS accounts of immigration enforcement incidents

In several Democratic-led states, lawmakers have advanced proposals aimed at limiting enforcement or increasing protections for immigrant communities. Some bills would bar or sharply restrict federal agents from carrying out immigration arrests in or near schools, churches, hospitals and courthouses.
New Mexico legislators recently advanced a bill that would prohibit government entities across the state from signing contracts with the federal government to detain people accused of immigration violations. Existing contracts also would be terminated. Hundreds of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees — many from Minnesota — are now housed in several rural New Mexico county jails. Republicans opposed to the bill have said those communities need the jobs and funding the federal detention contracts provide.
Maryland lawmakers are considering a variety of bills, including one Democratic-sponsored measure that would prohibit sheriffs, local police or any “agent of the state” from entering into 287(g) agreements with federal authorities to enforce civil immigration law and would also terminate existing agreements.
Some Maryland sheriffs spoke out against the proposal last week, arguing that 287(g) agreements help them do their jobs and serve as a “true public safety tool.”
Another bill set to be introduced in Maryland by Democratic Del. Adrian Boafo would bar ICE officers who joined after Jan. 20, 2025, the date of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, from holding positions within state law enforcement in the future.
Georgia Senate Democrats unveiled a package of bills that would limit face coverings and require federal immigration agents to show their badges. The legislation also would restrict outside National Guard deployments to the state, require judicial warrants for immigration enforcement in sensitive locations and allow residents to sue federal officials for civil rights violations. Given the state legislature’s Republican majority, these bills are unlikely to advance.











We’re seeing some new and unique approaches that we haven’t seen before.


– Amanda Essex, National Conference of State Legislatures’ Criminal and Civil Justice Program principal



“We’re seeing some new and unique approaches that we haven’t seen before, and I don’t think that’s going to be slowing down for the foreseeable future,” said Amanda Essex, the National Conference of State Legislatures’ Criminal and Civil Justice Program principal.
In Pennsylvania, lawmakers have introduced legislation that would ban mask-wearing by law enforcement, ban ICE arrests near courthouses, and criminalize certain violent enforcement tactics.
But Democratic state Sen. Tim Kearney said in a news release that he’s doubtful his state — where Republicans control the state Senate and Democrats the House and governor’s office — will act on several bills challenging immigration enforcement.
“Pennsylvania should pass these bills, but we need to be realistic that in a divided legislature, that is not going to happen,” Kearney said.
Lawmakers in Republican-led states are advancing a different set of immigration proposals, primarily to crack down on illegal immigration and support federal agents.
A bill introduced in West Virginia would create state-level criminal penalties for people found to be in the country illegally. The Florida House approved a measure requiring all businesses to use the federal verification tool, E-Verify, to determine whether new hires can legally work in the country.
Other bills in Florida would require new voters to show proof of U.S. citizenship and mandate that public colleges and universities admit only students who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present in the country.
States, cities are hard-pressed to fight violent ICE arrest tactics

In Tennessee, state Republican leaders, relying on guidance from the White House, announced a package of bills earlier this month that would add requirements for proving legal status to access grocery and housing benefits, school enrollment and professional licensing. Other legislation would require state and local courts to cooperate with ICE agents, and one measure would mandate that all local law enforcement agencies enter into 287(g) agreements with the feds. Republicans control both legislative chambers and the governor’s mansion in the state.
Another high-profile piece of legislation in Tennessee would prohibit people from seeking election to federal positions in the U.S. House and Senate if they hold dual citizenship or are not a natural-born citizen.
“Tennesseans should have full confidence that those serving at the highest levels of government put America first. If you want to represent our state in Washington, being born in the United States should be a basic qualification,” Republican state Rep. Johnny Garrett, one of the bill’s sponsors, said in a statement to the Tennessee Lookout.
The U.S. Constitution requires only that the president be a natural-born citizen.
Some Republican state lawmakers and national leaders have expressed concerns about the public release of sensitive or private information about federal agents, saying legislation is necessary to protect officers and their families from harassment or threats.
Tennessee lawmakers are now considering a bill that would conceal the names of all local, state and federal law enforcement officers involved in immigration enforcement. Critics argue that such proposals could be used to shield misconduct and make it harder to identify officers involved in high-profile or deadly encounters.
At least 15 states have proposed bills that would prohibit federal agents from wearing masks. California was the first state to enact a ban on law enforcement officers wearing masks, but the Trump administration sued to block the law and it is on hold until the lawsuit is resolved. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement, also has said that these types of bans stoke dangerous rhetoric against Immigration and Customs Enforcement “for cheap points and fundraising emails.”
Minneapolis shootings reverberate nationwide
The shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis earlier this month have intensified scrutiny of federal agents and prompted renewed state-level calls for greater transparency, independent investigations and stronger legal remedies. A third shooting injured a man who fled ICE agents at a traffic stop.
Trump has said Maine, where Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has openly opposed his policies, will be the next target for intensive immigration enforcement. Maine Democratic lawmakers pledged to file legislation this year that would prevent erroneous detentions and enforcement in schools and hospitals. Advocates are working with lawmakers to stop local jails from accepting federal payments to house immigrant detainees.
Maine Republicans blame the increased attention from Trump on a new state law barring local cooperation with federal agents.
Lawmakers in several states, including California, Colorado, Georgia, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania have already or plan to introduce measures that would allow residents to sue federal immigration agents for alleged civil rights violations. Supporters argue that existing federal legal remedies are too narrow or difficult to pursue.
Illinois has a similar law on the books, which was enacted in December, but some experts say it faces significant legal and logistical hurdles. The law has not yet been used to sue federal agents, according to immigration policy experts.
The U.S. Department of Justice sued Illinois over the law in an attempt to block it from going into effect, arguing that the measure is unconstitutional and threatens officers’ safety.
Jacqueline Stevens, a political science professor and founding faculty director of the Deportation Research Clinic at Northwestern University, said civil lawsuits alone are unlikely to deter misconduct because they rarely impose personal consequences on federal agents.
“You need to have criminal sanctions in place and not these civil sanctions, because if you get one or two ICE agents who are put in prison, that’s going to have an impact,” Stevens said.

A WalletHub analysis published earlier this month found that in nominal terms, Americans had the greatest credit card debt in history during the third quarter of 2025 — $1.35 trillion. 
When adjusted for inflation, it was exceeded in the third quarter of 2008 — as the Great Recession hit — when it was 8% greater.
In addition, the report said, credit card finance charges increased 36% from a pre-pandemic high in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $180 billion in the fourth quarter of 2025. 
The findings were based on data from the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The news comes after a November analysis found that Ohioans’ credit-card delinquencies were rising at the fifth-highest rate in the United States. 
With 20% of credit cards delinquent in the second quarter of 2025, Ohio saw an increase of 29% over a year earlier.
The median credit card debt for an Ohioan is $2,476.

The growth in credit-card debt and delinquencies indicates that for many consumers, the U.S. economy is not in a good place.
“The fact that the record amount of credit card debt we currently owe isn’t really an inflation-adjusted record probably won’t do much to make consumers feel better, John Kiernan of WalletHub said in a written statement. 
“We still have a ton of debt, and it remains extremely expensive — as do prices in general — with no savings in sight.”
Urging people with debt to budget carefully, he added, ​​”Nearly two in five people are already resigned to having even more credit card debt by the end of 2026…, and 42% of people expect to have credit card debt for their entire life.”
As the 2026 election year takes shape, issues such as affordability and inequality are likely to play a major role.
A New York Times-Siena University poll published on Thursday said that 64% of respondents disapproved of President Donald Trump’s handling of the economy. 
That was the second-highest level of disapproval he received on any issue. 
Sixty-eight percent disapproved of Trump’s handling of the Epstein files.
A Gallup poll conducted at the end of December found that Americans’ economic confidence had slipped to lows not seen since the depths of the pandemic. 
Two-thirds of Gallup respondents picked issues such as inflation, the cost of housing, low wages, health care costs, and debt as their most pressing issues.
Health care is a leading cause of economic anxiety. 
The December KFF Health Tracking Poll found that just under half of Americans have difficulty affording care, and that 36% reported putting off care in the prior year due to worries about affordability.
And as credit-card debt grows, large majorities of Americans are saying income inequality is a problem. 
A YouGov poll published earlier this month found that 80% of respondents believed the gap between the rich and poor was a very big or somewhat big problem. 
That includes 60% of self-identified MAGA Republicans and 57% of those who identify as very conservative.

No money for ICE until they follow the law and can be held accountable, policymakers say.
For weeks, Ohioans have been protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, after federal agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.
Mother and writer Renée Good, 37, died on Jan. 7, while U.S. Veterans Affairs ICU nurse Alex Pretti, 37, was killed on Jan. 24.
“ICE is completely out of control,” Ohio Democratic U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown, of Cleveland, said in an interview Monday. “I think it is time for them to leave.”
The violence needs to end, she added, and officials need to be held accountable.
“What we’re seeing is an agency that is out of control, and that’s destroying communities,” Brown said.
Last week, she voted against giving nearly $65 billion to the Department of Homeland Security, with $10 billion for ICE. She is urging her U.S. Senate colleagues to do the same.
“Until we get some accountability measures, until we get some transparency, until they are operating in a way that is actually lawful and lines up with the Constitution, I would not give them another red cent,” Brown said.
Although it passed the U.S. House, U.S. Senate Democratic leadership has said they will block the bill, which will likely lead to a partial government shutdown.
Congress hurtles toward partial shutdown after Alex Pretti killing in Minneapolis

Brown wants Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to be impeached, while other House Democrats blame her for the deaths.
Ohio Democratic U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes, of Akron, said the Pretti shooting is the direct result of the dangerous tactics ordered by President Trump and enabled by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
“Their approach is escalating chaos, putting innocent lives at risk, and shredding public trust,” Sykes said. “Communities deserve protection, not lawlessness. There must be full accountability and an immediate end to these reckless federal operations.”
But Vice President JD Vance argues that the “chaos” in Minneapolis isn’t due to ICE, but protesters and local law enforcement.
“Stop fighting immigration enforcement and accept that we have to have a border in this country,” Vance said Thursday. “It’s not that hard.”
In a change of course for Vance, he acknowledged that some mistakes may have been made, but claimed those could be remedied if Minneapolis police got out of ICE’s way and assisted them in enforcing federal law.
“The number one way where we could lower the mistakes that are happening, at least with our immigration enforcement, is to have local jurisdictions that are cooperating with us… It’s not what ICE is doing in Minneapolis; it’s what Minneapolis authorities are doing to prevent ICE from doing their jobs,” Vance claimed.
Many members of Ohio’s congressional delegation were unavailable to give comment Monday, their teams said.
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted’s team sent over a statement he made on social media, in which he tried to take the middle ground.
“The fatal shooting of Alex Pretti is tragic. My prayers are with his family and all who are grieving,” Husted wrote. “Any incident involving law enforcement’s use of lethal force must be thoroughly and objectively investigated.”
The senator continued by saying that ICE plays an “important role” in national security.
“Law enforcement officers and first responders, who are called upon to make split-second decisions in dangerous situations, are in difficult and often dangerous circumstances,” he said.
Husted has previously warned citizens not to “interfere with law enforcement operations,” according to WSYX-TV. He also praised ICE.
“I believe all public servants have a responsibility to lower the temperature around immigration enforcement, and no one should impede ongoing law enforcement actions,” Husted wrote.
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno reposted a lengthly statement on social media, which said, “By encouraging people to interfere in law enforcement operations, the Left is getting people killed.”
“Senator Moreno will vote to keep the government open, unlike Senate Democrats who are threatening to wreak havoc with another needless shutdown unless ICE is defunded,” Moreno spokesperson Reagan McCarthy said. “Chuck Schumer has lost control of his party to far-left lunatics who want to hold the country hostage to pass their radical agenda.”
Immigration enforcement has a massive budget, U.S. Rep. Brown said, noting that it was already given $75 billion previously.
We asked if a partial government shutdown was worth it to prevent ICE from getting more funding, which they may get later anyway.
“The thing about this situation right now, as it relates to a potential shutdown, is that I would harken back to the things that Donald Trump has been doing to essentially shut down the government step by step, piece by piece, tearing up departments like the Department of Education, ending programs at USAID. So he has been essentially shutting down the government in his own way,” Brown responded.
“I think it is important that, as checks and balances in our government, that we exercise our responsibility and duty to hold this administration accountable, and if that means that we do not fund ICE, then I would fully support that.”
U.S. senators are negotiating. Brown would like to see some tools that can increase transparency, like body cameras, added when they reach a compromise.
Not all services would be shut down if the bill doesn’t get passed — food assistance would still be in effect.

Some of those poets were friends of mine, some teachers, but all in some way were role models. Not only were they poets of a high order, they were activists on behalf of peace and social justice. The last time I talked to Paley on the phone, she was clearly frustrated with me because I had called to discuss a publishing matter for a magazine I edited, and she was on her way out the door to join a protest in New York City against George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq.
Are you joining the protest? That’s all she wanted to know.
Shortly before the Iraq War, about 2002, Rich came to Kansas City to read poems for the Cockefair Chair speaker series, an event attended by some students and professors but also many of Kansas City’s social elite. Rich spent her first 15 minutes on the podium not reading or talking about poetry but exhorting us to protest the impending war in the gulf.
I could provide many examples of others in that generation, speaking forcefully against war, prejudice, injustice of all kinds. Ray and Bly cofounded the group American Writers Against the Vietnam War and co-edited “A Poetry Reading Against the Vietnam War.” Ray wrote countless letters to newspapers and spoke on radio against war, racial discrimination and other matters.
I am, therefore, questioning my own response to the armed assaults by U.S. Immigration and Enforcement agents against American citizens and legal immigrants. I am horrified by a possible invasion of Greenland, a United States ally, and other countries. The Academy of American Poets just sent a group of poems by Cornelius Eady, Kimiko Hahn, Ed Roberson and Aafa Michael Weaver about the killing of Renee Nicole Good by ICE forces in Minneapolis.
Notice the ages of those four poets mentioned in the paragraph above. All in their 70s and 80s. Forgive me, poets in your 30s or 50s who might be responding in print, in public; these older poets keep showing up for me.
I know how difficult it is for anyone, much less a poet, to figure out how to respond to this assault on American values coming from inside America. I write nearly every day to the so-far unmovable U.S. Sen. Roger “Doc” Marshall, R-Kansas, and to his partner Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas. I write often to my state representatives or call them. All I can do is seek insight and inspiration from those who came before and met the day.
The least we writers can do is write. Write to everyone you can think of to express your opinions and outrage. Write poems, directly political poems or otherwise sincere and honest on any topic. I just received a note from Kansas poet HC Palmer, a retired physician and Vietnam veteran, as a reminder to us all who might, at these times, lose heart:

Jim Pillen was correct when he said Legislative Bill 1165 and its revamped approach to economic incentives for certain companies is “more aggressive and assertive than anything we’ve ever done before.”
Perhaps a better statement would have been to name the company that this legislation is intended to benefit, which has been reported as Union Pacific. Please keep in mind as you read this opinion column that “no government has ever given anyone anything that they didn’t first take from someone else.”
Why do states offer tax incentives? The answer is simple: Their taxes are too high, so states compete to see who can win the tax incentive giveaways.
It is good to study history so you don’t repeat the mistakes we’ve made before. Nebraska has a long history of implementing tax incentive programs to benefit businesses and attempt to encourage economic development.
Reaching Regions, a new academic journal supported by Iowa State University, the North American Regional Science Council and West Virginia University, researched tax incentives and the effect incentives have on economic development. They answered the following question: Why have local economic development policies been so disappointing?
“State and local efforts to attract ‘footloose’ firms to their regions through tax incentives or direct subsidies have largely proven ineffective in boosting population or employment,” researchers found.
Despite an extensive history of poor results, these economic development incentives have been created by our Nebraska Legislature. Nebraska’s first major tax incentive program came in 1987 through LB 775, which is known as the Employment and Investment Growth Act.
Over the years, this tax incentive program has paid out refunds and tax credits of nearly $4 billion. Currently, there remain 28 outstanding contracts. In 2024, $10 million in tax credits were claimed, according to the Nebraska Department of Revenue’s 2024 Tax Incentives Annual Report. However, the total amount of tax credits from these contracts yet to be claimed amounts to $45.6 million.
Gov. Jim Pillen speaks at a news conference at the Durham Museum in Omaha, with Union Pacific vintage railroad cars as a backdrop. Those attending included State Sen. Brad von Gillern, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, who introduced an incentives-focused bill on Pillen’s behalf.

In the early 2000s, Conagra — then a major Nebraska corporation — considered moving its corporate offices to Chicago. The Nebraska Advantage Act was introduced to replace the Employment and Investment Growth Act and, partly, to help keep Conagra in Nebraska. It did not work. Conagra is headquartered in Chicago today.
As of June 30, 2024, the total amount of tax incentives earned by the Nebraska Advantage Act was $2.57 billion. This tax incentive program could hit a net loss of more credits than tax income of over $150 million per year in many of the next 10 years.
The program now costs the State of Nebraska more than $120,000 in tax incentives for every job it creates, based on data from a 2024 legislative report on tax incentives. Currently, the Nebraska Advantage Act has tax credits or refunds yet to be claimed in excess of $1.3 billion.
Proponents of such tax incentive programs claim that the jobs created by these incentives will pay taxes. How many years do you think it will take for job incentives created to pay $120,000 in income and/or sales taxes?
Hint, NEVER! There is no way of knowing if the job may have been created anyway if the incentive was not offered.
The Nebraska Advantage Act has been replaced with the ImagiNE Nebraska Act. History repeats itself. Now LB 1165 will revamp the latest tax incentive program, revising the Key Employer and Job Retention Act.
The following is the language from LB1165’s statement of intent: “It is the intent of the Legislature to transfer five million dollars from the General Fund to the Site and Building Development Fund for fiscal year 2026-27 solely for funding key employer retention capital improvement grants. A grant to a key employer to support capital improvements related to such grant shall be made at a rate of five dollars per square foot of capital improvements. If the funds available for grants in any year are insufficient to provide grants to all eligible applicants, the department shall prioritize awards to the retention and relocation plan of the employer.”
I thought the state has a $471 million deficit? They are only transferring $5 million. So we are going to spend our way into property tax relief?
Nebraska seeks to sweeten corporate incentives, partly to ensure Union Pacific stays and grows

Perhaps you are like me. I have never found a provision in anything I have read that it is the government’s job to build private businesses or compete with private enterprise. Remember, the government does not reduce its budget to pay for all tax incentive programs. These incentives raise everyone’s taxes who don’t receive incentives.
Nebraska has many such programs like the ones mentioned, as well as tax increment financing (TIF) and others to give your hard-earned tax dollars to businesses that will then compete with smaller businesses who are ineligible for these incentives.
The bottom line of tax incentive programs is this: The government picks the winners. The losers are those companies who don’t have lobbyists like the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce.
The Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce’s new president is Heath Mello, a former state senator who said LB1165 reflects months of discussion with the Pillen team to retain talent and expand jobs.
The truth is that our state has a spending problem, which in turn raises your taxes. These tax incentive programs are a major reason why we have a spending problem. If Nebraska wants to compete to attract and/or keep businesses, young people, and retirees, we must lower our tax burden for everyone.
When we become competitive on taxes, we can compete with anyone. Today, we compete poorly with all of our neighboring states, and these tax incentive programs are actually a so-called solution. Thank you for reading.

Read it here.
Los legisladores demócratas de California están instando a sus colegas del Congreso a cerrar el gobierno federal y bloquear más fondos para las agencias de control de inmigración después de que agentes dispararan y mataran a otro civil en Minnesota durante el fin de semana.
 Al menos 50 senadores y asambleístas estatales demócratas —más de la mitad del grupo parlamentario del partido— condenaron el lunes el asesinato de Alex Pretti, residente de Minneapolis y enfermero de cuidados intensivos del Departamento de Asuntos de Veteranos, que el sábado fue asesinado a tiros por agentes federales de control de inmigración.
 Los legisladores proclamaron su solidaridad con Minnesota y otras ciudades y estados que han sido blanco de las fuerzas del orden federales. Criticaron lo que llamaron la militarización de las ciudades estadounidenses por parte de la administración Trump, mientras algunos se enjugaban las lágrimas.
 El paquete de gastos, previamente bipartidista, que financiaría los departamentos de Defensa, Trabajo, Salud y Servicios Humanos y Seguridad Nacional, espera una votación en el Senado de Estados Unidos, donde un número cada vez mayor de demócratas han prometido obstruirlo.
 Pero los legisladores de California advirtieron que los demócratas del Senado, muchos de los cuales representan a estados en disputa, podrían ceder y dar a los republicanos los votos que necesitan para impulsar la medida al escritorio del presidente Donald Trump.
 “Este mensaje es para el senador Chuck Schumer”, dijo la asambleísta Liz Ortega , demócrata de Hayward. “Haz tu trabajo. Defiende algo. No te rindas otra vez”.
 El presidente de la Asamblea, Robert Rivas , demócrata de Salinas, pidió a Schumer que “se haga a un lado” si no puede mantener a su grupo parlamentario en sintonía.
 Rivas y sus colegas también tenían un mensaje para los legisladores republicanos.
 “Necesitamos que se pronuncien. No pueden ver estos videos provenientes de Minneapolis, Minnesota, y pensar que es aceptable”, dijo Rivas. “Necesitamos su voz, su solidaridad y su defensa de los valores estadounidenses”.
 En referencia al hecho de que Pretti aparentemente portaba un arma permitida, el asambleísta Mark Gonzalez de Los Ángeles citó un tuit de 2018 del fallecido Charlie Kirk , que afirmaba que la Segunda Enmienda no era para cazar o para la autoprotección, sino “para garantizar que las personas libres puedan defenderse si, Dios no lo quiera, el gobierno se volviera tiránico y se volviera contra sus ciudadanos”.
 “¿Cómo se llama a un agente enmascarado que mata gente en la calle? ¿Cómo se llama a los niños que son separados de sus familias?”, preguntó González.
 Señaló que la Asociación Nacional del Rifle condenó las conclusiones prematuras sobre el tiroteo como “peligrosas y erróneas”.
 “Incluso la NRA está denunciando la peligrosa ignorancia de los funcionarios federales que intentan excusar el asesinato de Alex Pretti”, dijo González. “Cuando incluso los defensores más acérrimos de la Segunda Enmienda reconocen la necesidad de rendición de cuentas, debemos escuchar”.

Hasta ahora, los republicanos de California han dirigido sus críticas principalmente a los demócratas. Los líderes legislativos republicanos evitaron pronunciarse y remitieron a los miembros de la prensa a otros republicanos cuando se les pidió declarar sobre este tema.
 El senador Tony Strickland , republicano de Huntington Beach, afirmó que los funcionarios demócratas han creado condiciones de riesgo e inseguridad tanto para los agentes como para los civiles mediante las llamadas políticas de “santuario”, que impiden que las fuerzas del orden locales y estatales colaboren con los agentes federales de inmigración. Argumentan que estas políticas crean situaciones de riesgo en las que civiles como Pretti sienten la necesidad de vigilar y rastrear a los agentes.
 “Dejen de decir que los agentes del ICE son la Gestapo, la policía secreta, los nazis”, dijo el asambleísta James Gallagher de Chico, exlíder republicano de la Asamblea que recientemente anunció su candidatura a las elecciones especiales para completar los últimos meses del mandato del difunto representante Doug LaMalfa en el Congreso. “Este tipo de discurso contribuye al caos en lugares como Minnesota”.
 Gallagher calificó la muerte de Pretti como “algo terrible” y pidió una investigación independiente y rendición de cuentas. 
 La legislación exige una mayor supervisión del ICE
 Algunos legisladores se están comprometiendo a introducir nuevas medidas para limitar el poder de los agentes federales.
 “Ciertamente esta es una situación frustrante porque gran parte del poder y la autoridad aquí está en manos del gobierno federal en Washington, DC, pero eso no significa que la respuesta para nosotros sea no hacer nada”, dijo el asambleísta Jesse Gabriel , demócrata de Encino.
 Gabriel planea presentar un proyecto de ley que exigiría al fiscal general de California realizar una investigación independiente sobre cualquier tiroteo cometido por agentes federales de inmigración en el estado. Esta ley amplía una ley vigente que ya exige dichas investigaciones para los tiroteos cometidos por las fuerzas del orden locales y estatales. También será coautor, junto con el asambleísta Juan Carrillo, de un proyecto de ley que prohibiría a las agencias federales de inmigración utilizar recursos estatales para facilitar sus operaciones, como el almacenamiento de equipo y personal en propiedades estatales.
 “Tenemos que usar todas las herramientas a nuestra disposición, cada oportunidad legal que tengamos para usar nuestro poder, nuestra autoridad para pensar en todas las diferentes formas en que podemos contraatacar”, dijo Gabriel.
 También se someterá a votación en el Senado de California esta semana el Proyecto de Ley Senatorial 747, coescrito por la senadora Aisha Wahab de Hayward y el senador Scott Wiener , demócrata de San Francisco que se postula para reemplazar a la presidenta emérita Nancy Pelosi en el Congreso. Este proyecto permitiría a los californianos demandar a agentes federales por violaciones de derechos civiles . El proyecto de ley se basa en la medida de Wiener del año pasado que prohibía a los agentes federales de inmigración usar mascarillas , promulgada por el gobernador Gavin Newsom.
 Wiener argumentó que la cuestión no debería ser partidista.
 “Se trata realmente de los derechos de todos bajo cualquier administración federal”, declaró Wiener a CalMatters el lunes. “Las fuerzas del orden locales y estatales ya están sujetas a responsabilidad civil si violan los derechos de alguien, y los agentes federales, en realidad, no lo están”, añadió.
 “Lo que se busca es simplemente aplicar los mismos estándares a todas las fuerzas del orden”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012426_ICEProtestSF_JK_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-28 02:56:38.868003

No está claro por qué.,Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2026/01/las-ciudades-de-california-acaban-de-registrar-sus-tasas-de-homicidios-mas-bajas-en-decadas-no-esta-claro-por-que/,"Los homicidios en California aumentaron durante la pandemia de COVID-19 pero las cifras han caído a mínimos históricos en Los Ángeles, Oakland, San Francisco y muchas otras ciudades.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Por segundo año consecutivo, el gobernador Gavin Newsom celebra la disminución de la tasa de homicidios de California mientras la utiliza como garrote contra sus enemigos políticos.
 “La tasa de homicidios de su estado es 117% más alta que la de California”, le dijo a un congresista de Missouri que atacó a Newsom en las redes sociales el verano pasado.
 La gobernadora de Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, también le llamó la atención. “Su tasa de homicidios es literalmente el doble que la de California”, escribió en redes sociales dirigiéndose a ella.
 Lo que ha estado claro durante los últimos tres años es que los homicidios han disminuido en Los Ángeles y San Francisco, pero también en Fresno , Oakland, Richmond y Lodi.
 “Las ciudades de California están registrando tasas de homicidios históricamente bajas”, declaró Newsom en su discurso sobre el estado del estado a principios de este mes. “Oakland, la más baja desde 1967; Los Ángeles, la más baja desde 1966; y San Francisco, la más baja desde 1954”.
 Tras un aumento durante los primeros días de la pandemia, los homicidios han disminuido en todo el país.
 La razón es mucho menos clara. Para decirlo en términos de investigadores forenses, la respuesta es «multifactorial».
 Magnus Lofstrom, director de políticas de justicia penal en el grupo de expertos no partidista Public Policy Institute of California, dijo que el aumento de homicidios durante la pandemia puede haber sido el resultado de interrupciones en las actividades gubernamentales: las escuelas cerraron, la gente se quedó sin trabajo, los programas comunitarios para la prevención de la violencia y muchos servicios públicos básicos se suspendieron, dijo Lofstrom.
Las cifras de 2020 fueron impactantes. Tras años de descenso, la tasa de homicidios en California aumentó un 31 % en 2020, alcanzando 5.5 homicidios por cada 100,000 habitantes. En 2021, volvió a subir, alcanzando aproximadamente 6 homicidios por cada 100,000 habitantes.
Pero esa tendencia comenzó a cambiar en 2022, cuando el número de homicidios se redujo un 7%, luego un 14% en 2023 y otro 12% en 2024. A finales de 2024, la tasa de homicidios en California se redujo a 4.3 por cada 100,000 habitantes.
 La población de California era de aproximadamente 20 millones de personas la última vez que el estado registró cifras de homicidios tan bajas, la mitad de lo que es hoy.
 Al mismo tiempo que aumentaban las cifras de homicidios, el porcentaje de casos resueltos por la policía disminuía. La “tasa de resolución” de un departamento de policía compara el número de delitos denunciados con el número de arrestos realizados.
 Lofstrom dijo que la tasa de resolución de homicidios en todo el estado fue del 64,7% en 2019 y que había bajado al 54,6% en 2021, aunque las tasas pueden variar drásticamente entre los departamentos de policía.
 “Lo que vemos ahora en los datos hasta 2024 es que volvimos a superar el 64% en los casos de homicidios resueltos”, dijo Lofstrom. 
 La mitad de homicidios en Oakland
La alcaldesa de Oakland, Barbara Lee, afirmó que los homicidios han disminuido, al igual que los delitos graves con armas de fuego, como robos y asaltos con armas de fuego. Los 67 homicidios de Oakland en 2025 registraron el nivel más bajo desde 1967. En 2021, registró 134 homicidios.
 En Los Ángeles, los homicidios disminuyeron más del 18% a 230 en 2025, según un análisis de datos del LAPD realizado por Los Angeles Times.
 Las cifras que documentan la reciente disminución de las tasas de homicidios y el repunte previo vienen con una advertencia importante: la forma en que se recopilan los datos sobre delincuencia es inconsistente. Las fuerzas del orden informan directamente al FBI, que cada año publica datos bajo el Programa Uniforme de Denuncias de Delitos. El Departamento de Justicia de California elabora informes estatales a partir de esas cifras.
 Pero no todos los departamentos reportan sus estadísticas. Y entre los que sí lo hacen, algunos no reportan todos sus datos o la información es diferente. Por ejemplo, algunas jurisdicciones solo reportan los delitos que conllevan encarcelamiento.
 Las cifras de homicidios en California son proporcionadas por el Departamento de Justicia del estado cerca del final del año fiscal en junio, por lo que las estadísticas más recientes son de 2024. El Departamento de Justicia se negó a proporcionar a CalMatters cifras actualizadas hasta 2025.
 La caída en las tasas de homicidios no fue tan pronunciada en los condados de Orange y Ventura, que nunca experimentaron un pico significativo de la pandemia, y en el condado de Kern, donde la tasa de homicidios se mantiene firme como la más alta del estado. 
 Caída de la delincuencia a nivel nacional
 Un análisis a largo plazo de las estadísticas de delincuencia, en particular los datos de homicidios, muestra que la tasa de delincuencia de 2020-21 a nivel nacional y en California todavía era una fracción de sus máximos de principios de la década de 1990. Simplemente contabilizar los cambios interanuales oculta una verdad mayor: la delincuencia a lo largo de la década de 2020 ha disminuido significativamente en comparación con la tasa de hace 20 o 30 años.
Al igual que las disminuciones a largo plazo de la tasa de homicidios, la reciente reducción en California forma parte de una tendencia nacional. Un informe publicado el jueves por el Consejo de Justicia Penal, un centro de estudios independiente con sede en Washington, D. C., reveló que, en 35 grandes ciudades del país, los homicidios se redujeron un 21 % entre 2024 y 2025.
Cuando el FBI publique sus estadísticas sobre delincuencia a finales de este año, los investigadores del Consejo de Justicia Penal dijeron en el informe que la tasa nacional de homicidios podría caer a 4 por cada 100,000 personas, lo que sería la tasa de homicidios más baja jamás registrada.
 Shani Buggs, profesora asociada de UC Davis e investigadora de salud pública, dijo en el informe que las ciudades con importantes disminuciones en su tasa de homicidios tendían a gastar fondos federales de la pandemia en la prevención de la violencia y tenían departamentos de policía que se centraban en personas con reiteradas denuncias de delitos violentos, lo que les ayudaba a reanudar rápidamente las tasas de resolución previas a la pandemia.
 “No contamos con datos multisectoriales confiables ni con información contextual comparable disponible en las distintas jurisdicciones para identificar definitivamente —ahora o quizás nunca— qué impulsó estas disminuciones”, dijo Buggs.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/010318-Oakland-PD-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-28 01:57:05.182858

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes) Imagine a vulnerable child alone in a small life raft, struggling within a vast ocean as storms rage onward. The raft isn’t secure. The shoreline is far away.  
Now imagine a rescue boat pulls up alongside. This crew is made up of the same people who provided the raft. They don’t lift the child out. Instead, they cut the raft down by nearly one-third — leaving the child clinging to less. The waves surge higher.  The raft gets more unstable.  The rescue boat moves on. 
That’s what it felt like for many families when the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program was reduced by approximately 35% in late 2025.  The reduction was unexpected and announced quickly, with only a couple months’ notice to legislators and the public.  
KTAP is administered by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and funded primarily with federal dollars. The program provides monetary assistance to families living in poverty that help cover basic necessities, such as food, clothing and shelter, that stabilize families and prevent deeper crises.
To qualify for KTAP, a family of four cannot earn more than $1,315 in gross monthly income. For families at this margin, the assistance can mean the difference between having gas to get to work or losing employment; between keeping a child safely at home or entering the child welfare system due to “dependency.”
Dependency occurs when a parent or caregiver cannot meet a child’s basic needs despite genuine effort.  It is not about unwillingness—it is about inability.  KTAP is designed to intervene before families reach that breaking point.

Kinship families are especially affected. According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, approximately 59,000 Kentucky children—about 6% — are in kinship care, meaning they live with relatives or close family friends other than their parents. Of those families, 42% rely on KTAP.  Overall, the weakening of the KTAP program undermines the foundation that allows kinship families to step in and succeed.
The broader context makes these reductions alarming.  Kentucky ranks 36th nationally in child economic well-being, has twice the national rate of child maltreatment, and one in five children live in poverty and food-insecure households. At the same time, the foster care system is under severe strain, with approximately 8,700 children in care but only 4,600 approved foster homes.
Child placement concerns were underscored in a January 2025 Ombudsman’s Office investigative report documenting children sleeping in Department of Community Based Services office buildings — evidence of a system stretched beyond capacity.
These are not abstract statistics. They represent Kentucky children whose safety and stability depend on targeted prevention. When KTAP was reduced, the smallest and most vulnerable bore the cost — clinging to already fragile rafts made even smaller.
It’s unclear whether there is a plan to restore KTAP, even as a two-year state budget is being developed.  Little was said specifically about KTAP during or after the governor’s proposed budget. 
In October, CHFS Secretary Dr. Steven Stack said of the cuts, “When financial resources are available, we are committed to directing them to support Kentuckians.” That statement raises critical questions: Are funds to restore KTAP included in the proposed budget? Is CHFS actively engaging legislators to ensure restoration occurs? If not, why not?
If restoration is planned, it should be stated clearly and publicly. Families shouldn’t be left guessing whether essential help will return. 
The mayday calls of children have been sounding. What remains to be seen  is whether we will answer with urgency and resolve. Budgets reveal who we choose to protect and serve when choices are difficult. If restoration doesn’t happen now, it likely won’t happen at all. 
Vulnerable children rely on us to help them navigate stormy seas. Restoring KTAP is one way to ensure they don’t drown because we moved on.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260107SOTC708-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-28 00:57:13.020217

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)Millions of dollars flowing into Kentucky from an e-cigarette company settlement go straight to the state’s general fund, mixing with public taxes and other revenue. 
Republicans in both the House and Senate are trying again this year to redirect that money — and settlement dollars from any future, related litigation — into smoking and vaping prevention and cessation efforts, which they say  is a more appropriate place for the funds. 
Two bills — House Bill 187 and Senate Bill 74 — propose Kentucky establish a vaping settlement trust fund, administered by the attorney general, for the purpose of funnelling all money received through litigation or other measures from Juul toward tobacco-cessation efforts. Both bills have been assigned to committees but haven’t yet had hearings.

More than two dozen organizations — including the Kentucky Hospital Association, UK Markey Cancer Center, UofL Health Brown Cancer Center and the Kentucky Nurses Association —  backed the effort in a recent advocacy letter. Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office did not respond to a Lantern email asking if he supports the bills. 
Juul, an e-cigarette company, has to pay Kentucky more than $14 million dollars following a lawsuit over marketing practices aimed at youth. Those payments started in 2022. Juul’s next payment to Kentucky — about $2 million, gross — is due Dec. 31. 
A final payment of more than $6 million is due by Dec. 31, 2027. Juul has the option to split that final payment into smaller installments over the course of several years, through 2031. The net amount that could go to cessation is about $6 million. 
Sen. Craig Richardson, R-Hopkinsville, who is carrying the legislation in the Senate, said  the impact of that investment would be “tremendous.” 
“We’re already at a massive health care crisis in this country. We’re at a massive health care crisis in this state,” Richardson said. “To me, this is a simple way to make sure that money doesn’t just fall into the general fund, but is used for the intended purpose.” 
‘Concerning’ smoking rates

More than 8,000 minors try cigarettes for the first time each year, according to The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. About 5% of high school students smoke while nearly 20% use e-cigarettes, according to that organization’s data. Smoking also kills nearly 9,000 Kentuckians every year and costs the state billions in health care costs. 
Smoking rates among youth are “very concerning,” said Rep. Robert Duvall, R-Bowling Green, sponsor of the House bill. By spending more on prevention and cessation, he said, Kentucky could lower the cost burden on the health care system and improve workforce participation at the same time. 
Griffin Nemeth, a youth tobacco prevention advocate, said allocating the funds toward prevention and cessation is a “no brainer.”   
“I think it’s less of a question of why we’re asking for allocation now, and more a question of why there hasn’t been one already,” he told the Lantern. “These funds are urgently needed to support youth prevention and cessation, specifically, and I think our legislature, especially with the recent wins that we’ve had in past years, is in a better place than ever to show some bipartisan support for the issue.” 
One of those wins, for example, is a 2025 law that gave the Kentucky Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control inspection and enforcement powers over retailers who sell tobacco and vape products and established a framework for fining businesses and clerks who sell to underage Kentuckians. 
“​The youth nicotine use crisis is not disappearing anytime soon,” Nemeth said. “While we have had strong measures put in place to protect kids from these products at the point of sale, it’s time for that funding piece to catch up as well.”
The health care cost
Smoking costs Kentucky $6.3 billion every year in lost productivity and puts a $634 million dent in Medicaid, according to The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which also reports about 37% of cancer deaths each year are from smoking. 
“We see the cost of health care increasing exponentially,” Duvall said. “We’re on a path that is not good when it comes to the cost of health care, so we’ve got to make every effort to reduce the cost of health care long term, and that starts with prevention.”

Richardson, whose wife is an oncology pharmacist, said anything to do with preventing cancer is “near and dear” for him. He also wants to create a framework that protects his daughter from vaping. 
“I hope my daughter grows up to be … mature and forward thinking and preserving of herself and staying away from the temptations and that pressure,” he said. “It does hit close to home. It is personal, and sometimes I hate to make legislation about something so personal, because getting your emotions wrapped up in legislation could sometimes lead to even greater disappointment. But there are some things worth fighting for, and I think this is a good one.” 
Neither Richardson nor Duvall expect a fight in passing this legislation, with both expressing widespread support from their colleagues. Lawmakers have proposed this legislation for three years, with advocates saying the biggest barrier to passage was the session clock.  
“I don’t anticipate this being some kind of fight, knock down, drag out. The thing that worries me the most is we’re in a budget year, and there’s so many competing issues, I just don’t want this to get lost in the shuffle,” Richardson said. “But I do not anticipate there being any negativity or major opposition to the bill. I just worry that it might be a timing issue.” 
During the 60-day legislative session, which adjourns on April 15, the legislature’s priority is to pass a two-year state budget, which will originate from the House. Leaders have said this budget may be the most difficult they’ve drafted as they navigate recent federal changes.

“This is obviously a challenging budget year, just because of the uncertainty with the One Big Beautiful Bill, and the Medicaid contributions that Kentucky is going to have to have,” Duvall said. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will cut federal Medicaid spending over 10 years by $880 billion. Congress approved the measure last summer. More than 1 in 3 Kentuckians depend on Medicaid to pay for their health care. 
Still, despite that “uncertainty,” Duvall said, the Juul fund proposal is “a pretty small ask in terms of the big picture.”  
“I think the momentum is good. I think the feedback is positive,” Richardson said. “It’s just: Things are very busy up here, and we’ve got to be aggressive in getting it moved early.” 
A ‘vital step’
Doug Hogan, the government relations director in Kentucky for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said one of the most effective prevention approaches involves peer-to-peer advocacy. 
“Many times, a youngster starts using these products because he or she thinks that it’s cool and it’s the ‘in’ thing to do,” Hogan said. “If we can get to those kids and give them the facts and the truth and they hear it from someone who looks like them, is about the same age as them, then they’re much more likely to say, ‘oh, okay, I hadn’t thought of that. I didn’t know there were negative health consequences.’” 
With the funds from Juul going toward programs that offer such peer-to-peer education, Hogan said, Kentucky could reach “tens of thousands of additional Kentucky students each year.” 
“The Juul settlement was reached because Juul intentionally preyed upon the youth,” Hogan said. “And this legislation really is an important and vital step in ensuring that those settlement dollars are actually used for their intended purpose, which is youth prevention.”



National report gives Kentucky failing grades
Kentucky is failing to adequately prevent smoking and protect people from secondhand smoke, according to a national report released Wednesday.  
The 2026 State of Tobacco Control report, released Wednesday from the American Lung Association, gives Kentucky mostly failing grades when it comes to funding prevention programs, the strength of the state’s smokefree workplace laws and more. 
“From this report, you can take away that our policy initiatives in Kentucky are desperately in need of some improvement and update,” said Shannon Baker, the director of advocacy at the American Lung Association in Kentucky.
Kentucky received the following grades in the annual report:

Funding for State Tobacco Prevention Programs — F. Kentucky spends about $2 million on tobacco prevention, which the Lung Association reports is about 10% less than what it should, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations. Baker said the General Assembly needs to double this investment. 


Level of State Tobacco Taxes — F. Kentucky’s tax rate for a 20-pack of cigarettes is $1.10, which Baker would like to see increase by $1-2. In doing so, she said the state could deter youth from ever starting to smoke. “There is evidence that suggests that particularly youths are price sensitive,” she said. In 2011, when the tax rate was 60 cents a pack, about 30% of Kentucky adults smoked. The Kentucky legislature increased the tax to $1.10 in 2018 and smoking rates fell to around 17% in 2022. 


Strength of Smokefree Workplace Laws — F. Kentucky does not have a statewide law prohibiting smoking in public places and workplaces, Baker said. Her organization wants to see such a law that would also ensure “there is no indoor smoking allowed and no exposure to secondhand smoke.” Even when one cannot smell smoke, she said, they may still be breathing toxins and carcinogens, which can cause cancer and other health problems.   


Coverage and Access to Services to Quit Tobacco — C. Kentucky’s best grade in this report reflects the fact that the state’s Medicaid program provides access to all quit medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for people who choose to quit tobacco products. The report cites “minimal barriers” to accessing that help. 


Ending the Sale of All Flavored Tobacco Products — F. Baker said “fruity and candy flavors” in some vaping products are “not intended for adults.” Youth, she said, are “lured” and “enticed” by these products. 

The Quit Line 
In April 2025, the federal government eliminated the Office on Smoking and Health, which “put Kentucky in direct jeopardy of losing $1.6 million of federal funds to support tobacco prevention and cessation,” Baker said. The money was reinstated but the office remains effectively shuttered, she said.

During a rollercoaster of cuts and reinstated funds last year, Kentucky’s cessation efforts faced an “unpredictable” future, she said, adding that “on-again, off-again” funding makes effective planning difficult. It “has jeopardized the state’s ability to consistently do the work that needs to be done to keep kids from ever initiating use and to help support both kids and adults who are prepared to quit.” 
At most risk is the state’s Quit Line, which a Cabinet for Health and Family Services spokeswoman said received 1,783 enrollees in 2025. 
Because of federal uncertainty, Baker said, the Kentucky General Assembly should up its state-level investments in prevention. 
“Even a modest increase of $2 million in each year of the biennial budget is so important to sustaining the work of the program in a state where … our smoking rate is among the very worst in the nation, and our youth use of these nicotine products has outpaced the national rate,” she said. 
In 2022, 17% of adult Kentuckians smoked, significantly higher than the national rate of 11%. The rate of new lung cancer cases, too, is higher than the national average — 84.1 per 100,000 people in Kentucky compared with nearly 52.8 per 100,000 nationally.

William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), chair of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, leads discussion during a voting session Tuesday on bills to ban 287(g) agreements and prohibit face coverings for law enforcement officers. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The Maryland Senate could be taking up bills as early as this week to ban agreements between local police and federal immigration authorities and to prohibit masks on law enforcement agencies, after the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee approved both Tuesday.
The committee vote came less than a week after hours of testimony on the two bills, and the same day that the House Judiciary Committee was holding its own combative hearing on a companion bill to do away with the so-called 287(g) agreements between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local sheriff’s departments. Nine Maryland counties have entered into such agreements, that require their jails to hold undocumented suspects to hand over to ICE for deportation proceedings.
Both the House and Senate committee hearings took place against the backdrop of increased scrutiny of increasingly aggressive immigration enforcement, after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti, 37 in Minnesota. That shooting came weeks after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good, also 37, in Minneapolis.
The Trump administration policies were never far from the discussion in Annapolis Tuesday.
“We need to just get out of this business right now,” said Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), chair of Judicial Proceedings and lead sponsor of Senate Bill 245, which would ban 287(g) agreements.
The committee voted 8-3, on party lines, to approved the bill that would prohibit local police or any “agent of the state” from entering into an agreement with the federal government to enforce civil immigration law.
The vote came after the committee rejected an amendment from Sen. Mary-Dulany James (D-Harford) that would not have banned the agreements, but would have would have prohibited certain immigration enforcement activities by local police “unless an individual has been charged with or convicted of a felony.” Her amendment would also have required correctional facilities to report that and other information to the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention and Policy.
“I have a sheriff who I have a lot of respect for who’s been running a 287(g) jail-based program, as have some other jurisdictions in Maryland,” James said. “I’m impressed with how it’s run. They [ICE agents] are nothing like the people that I’m seeing on the [TV] screen in the streets.”
But Smith urged the committee to reject the amendment because of how the immigration enforcement is being handled by federal agents. administration.
After about 30 minutes of debate, the committee rejected James’ amendment by a 7-4, with all three committee Republicans – Sens. William G. Folden of Frederick County, Chris West of Baltimore and Carroll counties and Mike McWay of Western Maryland – joined James in support.

During a briefing with reporters Tuesday morning, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) defended Smith’s bill, calling the operations of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security under the Trump administration “unconstitutional and unlawful.”
“I’m very cognizant that we could see something happen in Maryland, and we want to make sure that we’re prepared as possible for whatever surge could happen,” he said. “The partnership with an organization that’s operating with the procedures that it has right now is undermining faith in law enforcement.”
If approved, Maryland would join several Democratic-led states including Delaware, Illinois and New Jersey to ban such agreements. California legislature is working to also approve a ban.
‘Storm troopers’
The Judicial Proceedings Committee spent about 70 minutes on the face-covering legislation sponsored by Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s) before voting 7-4, with James joining the three Republicans, to move the bill to the full Senate.
Senate Bill 1 would prohibit face coverings on law enforcement officials working in the state, including ICE agents who are typically masked. The bill would ban items such as a balaclava, ski mask or neck gaiter for officers on duty. Exceptions would be made for officers “actively engaged in an undercover operation,” someone wearing a motorcycle helmet, a garment worn for religious purposes or when health-related matters are involved.
The committee approved a couple of amendments, to require that the Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission develop a uniform policy prohibiting face coverings, versus a model policy. Violations would now be civil offenses, not criminal ones, and the penalty would be a fine up to $1,500 instead of up to $2,000 and possible two years imprisonment.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Even with those amendments, opponents were not completely satisfied.
West said he agrees that law enforcement officers should not be wearing masks resembling “storm troopers in Star Wars,” but he said there could be future conflicts between state officers trying to enforce the law on federal officers doing their duties under federal law.
“The local officers are going to say, ‘Well, then you are obstructing justice. I’m putting you under arrest.’ And the ICE officers are going to respond by saying, ‘You’re obstructing federal officers, I’m putting you under arrest,’” West said. “Each trying to put the other squadron under arrest. This is bad. It’s not going to end happily.”
Sen. Jeff Waldstreicher (D-Montgomery), vice chair of the committee, said after the voting session that the committee “made a statement today that the actions of the federal government are unacceptable to our Maryland values, and we as a legislature have a duty to respond. The committee had a legitimate debate, both on the underlying policies and the constitutionality of those policies, and we sent it to the floor of the Senate to continue that conversation.”
Ferguson said both measures could be debated on the Senate floor as early as Thursday.
287(g) in the House
About two hours before the Senate committee’s vote on its 287(g) bill, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on a House version sponsored by Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s).

Williams said ICE isn’t providing public safety in communities, even in those Maryland jurisdictions that have signed on to them.
One day after Wicomico County Executive Julie Giordano (R) testified against the Senate version of the bill last week, she announced on social media Friday that the county signed a 287(g) agreement, the ninth in Maryland to do so.
“Officials who signed these agreements claim that there are means of enhancing public safety, but that’s false,” Williams said. “These agreements drain taxpayer dollars from the real work of local law enforcement, and while ICE does provide training equipment and some oversight, it offers no reimbursement for the staff and overtime required by these additional responsibilities.”
Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford), whose county has the state’s second-longest 287(g) agreement, asked Williams if she’s prepared to push a bill to have President Donald Trump (R) send ICE teams to the state to replace the eliminated 287(g) agreements.
“There will be blood on the hands of people that move this when folks die, because there’s no longer a jail model in place. So are you ready to do that?” Arikan said.
“First of all, ICE shouldn’t be randomly engaging in shooting individuals,” said Williams, who summarized there have been federal agents and ICE activity in her legislative district where there’s no 287(g) in place.
Del. Susan McComas (R-Harford) said it should be up to individual jurisdictions whether they want ICE or not.
“That’s the fair way to do this,” she said. “If the community wants ICE, then let them have it.”
When Del. Nino Mangione (R-Baltimore County) asked why a legal immigrant be worried about immigration enforcement, several people in the audience laughed.
“Really? I would say basically every news story for the past 12 months would make the case for why legal immigrants, undocumented immigrants would be worried about interacting with ICE,” Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) said. “Many people are under threat by ICE right now. I think that legal, documented immigrants also have a reasonable fear of interacting with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sen.-William-C.-Smith-Jr.-1-27-2026-cropped-e1769595345919-1024x678.jpg,,,2026-01-28 05:58:08.046297

(Photo by G. Anthonie Riis/U.S. Army)An annual report evaluating statewide tobacco regulations marked Maryland down for cutting $5 million from tobacco prevention programs, at a time when federal funding and support is not guaranteed and advocates say state-level actions are more influential than ever.
The American Lung Association released its annual State of Tobacco Control Report Wednesday, which grades states on various policy categories to help reduce tobacco use.
For Maryland, much of the report card was unchanged from the previous year, with high marks in some areas and low marks in others. But with a $5 million drop in state funds for tobacco control and prevention, the association gave Maryland a “thumbs down” as part of the state’s overall report card.
Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, a spokesperson for the American Lung Association National and an assistant professor for Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said that now is not the time to “take our foot off the gas” for prevention funding and programs.
“Addiction to nicotine can become lifelong,” Galiatsatos said. “This isn’t an addiction that gets you high or inebriated or intoxicated, so the intention behind it is to introduce it to every facet of your life, so when you go through the motions of your daily habits, you’re constantly triggered to use these products.”
According to the report, Maryland’s funding for tobacco control programs dropped compared to last year’s. For fiscal year 2026, Maryland provided $16.3 million in state funding for tobacco prevention and control programs. That’s down from $21.3 million allocated from the year before.
And with the state facing another $1.6 billion budget deficit in the current session, more cuts may be on the line.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention best practices suggest that Maryland should be spending closer to $48 million on prevention programs. The lung association gave Maryland an “F” for its prevention-funding – along with 38 other states and Washington, D.C. The organization urges Maryland and many others to boost funding for prevention efforts.
But Aleks Casper, the association’s advocacy director for Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and Washington, D.C., notes that funding is just part of a system of policies that help reduce tobacco use and said Maryland has led the way on other policy areas.
“You have to look at the whole picture. None of it can be done in silos,” Casper said. “The reason we grade in these multiple categories is that they all work together. They’re all pieces of the puzzle that fit together … If we can prevent people from ever starting to use the products and support them when they’re ready to quit, those are our big puzzle pieces.”
In last year’s report, the American Lung Association held up Maryland as the “most improved” state due to an expansion of the Clean Indoor Air Act to include e-cigarettes as well an increase to the cigarette tax from $3.75 to $5.00.
The tobacco tax earns the statea “B” in the tobacco taxes category and the Clean Indoor Air Act earns it an “A” in the smoke-free air category, both unchanged from the year before
But Casper said that the drop in funding also affected the state’s score for the category rating access to cessation services. Last year, Maryland had an “A” in that category for its Medicaid coverage for helpful medications and access to some counseling for people trying to quit tobacco products. But the drop in funding also dropped Maryland’s score to a “B” in the 2026 report, Casper said.
Lawmakers have not passed legislation that would limit or ban flavored tobacco products in the state, a key policy stance to help reduce the number of youths who take up smoking or vaping. Maryland continues to earn an “F” in that category, along with 46 other states.

“In comparison to other states, I think we can be proud of what the report shows. At the same time … we clearly have a lot more to do,” Galiatsatos said. “It’s important not to look at this report as static — like we’ve done our job. We have to be dynamic. Because there’s many things that the tobacco industry is, but one of them is not a quitter.
“They’re going to continue pushing for their products in various ways,” he said. “That’s where I think the report really captured Maryland’s attempts toward public health matters around tobacco.”
Smaller decisions can also decrease tobacco use, Galiatsatos noted. In 2024, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) approved legislation that banned tobacco use in Camden Yards and at M&T Bank Stadium.
The ordinance is aimed at “ending the longstanding link between baseball and smokeless tobacco and preventing youth use of harmful and addictive tobacco products, especially by student athletes who imitate their role models on and off the field,” Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said in a statement at that time.
“I think that should get highlighted,” Galiatsatos said, “Like I said, we should be proud of the work we’ve done but mindful that there’s a lot more work to do.”
But the American Lung Association says that policy decisions at the state-level are more crucial than ever, as the Trump administration could continue to disrupt funding and operations for federal programs that help states with tobacco-use reduction efforts.
“When you look at tobacco prevention and control policies from a national perspective and a federal perspective, 2025 was really a devastating year for us,” said Casper said.
The 2026 report says that staffing reductions at the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration caused “significant disruption to operations.”
“This unprecedented loss of federal capacity marked one of the most significant setbacks in tobacco prevention and control in decades,” the report says. “It creates an opening for the tobacco industry to expand its reach and target new users, which will have consequences on tobacco use rates in the U.S.”
Last year, the administration also delayed grant payment to support efforts in tobacco control, which caused “extensive damage” to those programs. Policy actions that fast-track FDA-approval of specific nicotine and tobacco products also concern the American Lung Association.
“With all of this uncertainty at the federal level,” Casper said, “It is now more important than ever that states really look to see what they can do to ensure that these continue and that there are robust programs available.”

I wonder how he would respond to being labeled a “domestic terrorist” or an “assassin,” or hearing that he planned to “massacre” federal agents?  
Pretti was an ICU nurse who was admired by colleagues and who was dedicated to patients who required specialized skills for grave conditions. He was committed to human rights and served as an official monitor in the treacherous situation with ICE which resulted in the death of Renne Nicole Good barely two weeks ago.  
Family and friends described him as “empathic,” “compassionate,” and a “sweet, kind, gentle soul.” Yet officials in the federal government, in service to their own sordid agenda, betrayed the public trust with their mendacity and lack of accountability, and openly engaged in a cover up.  
They denied what we could see with our own eyes.  There was no talk of an investigation or legal process, the victim’s Constitutional rights, or regret for the life they had taken.  Instead, they were quick to establish a narrative that maligned the man they murdered in a senseless and barbaric act.  
Yes, I hold them responsible for the death of Alex Jeffrey Pretti.  They set the tone for violence in our cities and towns with their heinous policies and blatant disregard for human life.  They sanctioned the use of force against those who were unarmed and vulnerable, and who had a right to peaceful assembly.
In his own words, honoring a deceased patient at the Veteran’s Administration hospital where he worked, Alex Jeffrey Pretti reminded us that “freedom is not free.”
Each day we become more cogently aware of that statement as we witness the hallmark signs of authoritarianism in our government. On a daily basis we are witnessing the breakdown of checks and balances, overreach by the Executive Office, the erosion of our Constitutional rights and the rule of law, attacks on the media and journalistic freedom, abuse of power and a lack of accountability, threats and retribution to those in opposition, and a pervasive assault on voting rights and liberal democracy.
For those of us who take to the streets, at grave risk to our lives and our personal safety, we are fighting for the country we love and to preserve the freedoms of a free and open democracy.  We are not “domestic terrorists,” “assassins,” or people bent on obstructing the law or planning a “massacre” of law enforcement or federal agents.
Many of us are retired nurses, teachers, social workers, public officials, counselors, scientists, healthcare workers, and physicians.  We are people who, like Alex Jeffrey Pretti, have dedicated our lives to the common good, and who are profoundly concerned about the current trajectory of our nation and the deleterious impact on its citizens.  We are mourning the loss of hard-fought freedoms, an economy that supports working class people, a healthcare system that supports the needs of the most vulnerable, a unified country with shared values, and a government we can trust to provide for national security and safety in our communities.
It is not customary that we have federal troops in our communities, border agents with weapons threatening and harassing our neighbors, law enforcement agents killing innocent people engaged in peaceful protest, or federal officials defying states’ rights and sanctioning violent action against citizens.  
We are now subjected to authoritarian rule without the protection of the rule of law and due process.  This is why we organize, why we march and keep vigil, why we fight for social justice, risk our lives, why we protest.  Democracy is not a spectator sport.  We “show up” because we love our country and because we are committed to preserving our freedoms.  
Alex Jeffrey Pretti had it right. Freedom is not free. Throughout our history we have had to confront the malevolent forces that threaten our freedom, often at the cost of human life. Those who protest to preserve American values, and to secure the safety of others in our society, are fighting for all of us.  They are courageous individuals who are willing to risk their own lives to protect the rights of others. Let us honor the life of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by bearing witness to the truth and holding our government officials accountable for this sad and tragic loss of life.
We are at a tipping point in our nation. Will we stand up for our democracy, to uphold the law, and to preserve traditional American values or will we cower in shame at what we have become?

And the one that continues to plague me most is the destruction of Gaza––its people and their habitat. 
Don’t be duped by a ceasefire declaration, the silence in mainstream media about the plight of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank today, or a U.S.- backed riviera plan for Gaza. These are only strategies to delude us into thinking that all will be well. The reality is quite different.
Palestinians in Gaza continue to be killed despite the ceasefire. Heightened attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank are taking place while Jewish settlements are being expanded. Greedy U.S. contractors are lining up to see what profits can be made by business deals and investments in the Gaza riviera plan––a callous and unjust project before it even begins since it completely excludes the voices and representation of Palestinian people.
As winter sets in, freezing temperatures and a glaring lack of food, clean water, heating, not to mention housing, is not available for thousands of people in Gaza trying to restore their lives––a feat not even imaginable for those of us not living there. The presence of amoral political leaders in the U.S. and Israel calls for a moral reckoning and a recalibration of one’s moral compass. Unfortunately, many people become indifferent, even complacent in the face of futility. Anyone with any hint of compassion does not have to think very deeply to conclude that the situation in Palestine is a moral tragedy.
Unfortunately, the way the geopolitical system is set up gives license to political leaders to commit crimes against humanity and enjoy impunity. Israel and the United States have breached international law repeatedly and continue to do so with no apparent repercussions, as yet. Benjamin Netanyahu travels to the United States freely when if in another country he would be arrested. And it seems that the global community is not in any rush to change international law: doing so threatens national sovereignty, and also national economic interests. There are many governments, Israeli, the United States, British, Italian, Australian and others, as well as transnational corporations and financial institutions benefiting from the war in Gaza through arms production, intelligence, technology, investments, humanitarian aid, etc.
What needs to happen? The pressure needs to come from below. Palestinian resistance is not new––it started a century ago after the Balfour Declaration in 1917. From 1936-1939, The Great Revolt took place which was a popular uprising against the British style of governance and Zionist motives. Around the world, not many people know or even understand the extent of the oppression of Palestinian people over the years or of their resistance. But this seems to be changing with a growing international solidarity for the Palestinian people. 
Even in Connecticut we are seeing a growing number of groups in solidarity with Palestinians. Groups such as the Jewish Voice for Peace, Connecticut Solidarity Palestine Coalition, We Will Return CT, American Muslims for Palestine, CT, the Palestinian Solidarity Working Group of the CSU-AAUP as well as many student and other organizations. These movements can result in change, and are the only hope at the moment.
The apartheid system in South Africa collapsed in 1994 due to a series of factors which over the years made the situation untenable, but an essential component was the global BDS movement (boycott, divestment, sanctions) strangling the South African economy. Of course, most Western governments voted against boycotts, divestment and sanctions (and will do the same with Israel) but with time and pressure from students and other activist groups it did work.
In 2005, a BDS movement was created by Palestinians and is a non-violent response to violence imposed on them. On their website, it says: “Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) is a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality. BDS upholds the simple principle that Palestinians are entitled to the same rights as the rest of humanity.”
Angela Davis, activist and academic said this after a delegation to Palestine, “Each and every one of us —including those members of our delegation who grew up in the Jim Crow South, in apartheid South Africa, and on Indian reservations in the U.S.— was shocked by what we saw. We issue an urgent call to others who share our commitment to racial justice, equality, and freedom [and] we unequivocally endorse the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Campaign.”
The current situation in Gaza is neither just nor humane, and never will be if allowed to continue as is. A growing global BDS movement in solidarity with Palestine may be the only way to bring forth the radical change that is needed.  Palestinians cannot do this on their own.
The phrase “Lest we forget” comes from a poem that Rudyard Kipling wrote in 1897. The phrase is now commonly used to commemorate the falling of soldiers during war. I want to extend it to all the children, mothers, teachers, doctors, journalists, humanitarian workers, and the list goes on who have also died during this horrendous war so that we do not forget.

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)More than 200 witnesses signed up to testify on a proposed congressional redistricting plan and the House Rules Committee listened to more than five hours of debate Tuesday, but the outcome was never in doubt.
The 26-member committed voted along party lines, with all six Republicans opposed, to send House Bill 488 to the full House, just days after the bill was introduced. There was no debate on the committee, which also took no action on a Republican alternative.
Republicans will likely delay a preliminary vote when it reaches the full House, perhaps as early as Wednesday. But a final vote could still come by the end of the week, sending it to the Senate where its future is far less certain.
“Just for clarity, everybody here knows we’re not here in this position because we chose to be, because we want to be,” said Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), the lead sponsor of HB 488, during testimony Tuesday. “We’re here because our current president, the current administration, basically, in a desperate attempt to rig the next election in House of Representatives and prevent that next election from delivering any meaningful check on his power, chose to call first the governor of Texas and tell him that he deserved five more votes.”

Wilson was part of a five-member Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission that was empaneled in November, in response to that move by Republican-led states to redraw their congressional district boundaries for partisan advantage before the 2026 midterm elections.
A divided panel recommended last week that Maryland should redistrict, and forwarded a proposed map that would heavily revise the 1st District, the only seat currently held by a Republican in Maryland, Rep. Andy Harris, an eight-term incumbent and leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.
A version of that map was introduced in the House Friday and rushed through the Rules Committee by Democratic leadership.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) took the unusual step of testifying for the bill Tuesday.
“It is imperative that Maryland do its part to ensure that Congress is able to function as a meaningful check on executive overreach,” Moore told the committee. “And now is the time for the General Assembly to do what Marylanders expect. Debate the map, improve it, if necessary, and then take the vote.”
The Department of Legislative Services massaged boundaries of the commission’s “conceptual” map to eliminate population variations that could have led to it being thrown out by a court. But it keeps the general outlines of the commission proposal, altering all eight districts but making the biggest changes to the 1st District.
That district currently include the entire Eastern Shore before bending into Cecil and Harford counties and the eastern part of Baltimore County. The new map cuts off part of the upper Shore, instead pushing across the Chesapeake Bay into parts of Anne Arundel and Howard counties, including a part of Columbia. That would increase the number of liberal Democrats in the district, making it harder for a conservative Republican like Harris to keep the seat.
Virginia court strikes down redistricting amendment headed for April ballot

Wilson’s bill also calls for amendments to the state constitution to lift the requirement that congressional districts be compact, contiguous and observe jurisdictional and natural boundaries when possible. It would also say that redrawn map would remain in effect for the next two congressional elections, until the traditional post-Census redistricting takes place after 2030.
Even as it was passing HB 488, the committee declined to vote on House Bill 482, an alternative offered by House Minority Leader Del. Jason Buckel (R-Allegany).
His bill would amend the Maryland Constitution to create independent redistricting commissions, echoing a proposal pushed unsuccessfully by former Gov. Larry Hogan (R) during his two terms in office. It also proposes granting the Supreme Court of Maryland exclusive authority over congressional and legislative redistricting if a plan is not enacted or if a lawsuit is filed challenging a plan.
Buckel’s bill also proposed prohibiting future mid-decade redistricting, and it would impose the same compact and contiguous requirements on congressional districts that apply to legislative maps. Buckel told the committee he offered his bill in good faith as an alternative to Wilson’s bill.
“We should be looking to do things that truly are fair and that truly reflect our entire population, from Oakland to Ocean City, and that have unquestioned legality, rather than something that simply meets the partisan moment of the day,” he said. “I think we’re better than that.”
Registered Democrats make up about half the registered voters in the state, to about 25% each for Republicans and unaffiliated voters. But a series of redistricting efforts have taken a map that was evenly split between the major parties in 2002, and created one in which Republicans hold just one seat.

“You deserve the majority of representation,” Buckel said. “You’re the majority of the state, but you neglect those geographic areas, as well as your own citizenry who share different political opinions, if you don’t try to compromise and reach a goal that at least allows them to have a voice.”
While Wilson’s bill is expected to steam through the House, it could hit a roadblock in the Senate, where President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) is an outspoken opponent of mid-decade redistricting. The bill will likely head to the Senate Rules Committee, where it could languish without a hearing or a vote.
Ferguson, who was also a member of the governor’s advisory committee, has said that not only is redistricting for partisan advantage the wrong thing to do, he worries that it could backfire on Democrats, either by opening the current map to legal challenges or by unwittingly making other districts in the state competitive.
“I don’t think much has changed since our initial analysis,” Ferguson said in a Tuesday morning meeting with reporters.
“I mean, the issue of Maryland was not about the U.S. Constitution,” he said. “It’s about the court applying the Maryland State Constitution to all redistricting and having thrown out our map in the 21-22 year. Nothing’s really changed about that legal analysis.”
A vote by the full Senate is not expected.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Republican candidates vying for the top spot in state government gave their plans to transform education on all levels for Iowa students during a gubernatorial debate Tuesday evening, claiming leftist indoctrination starts with teacher education before making its way into classrooms and parents need more control.
Hosted by conservative organization Moms for Liberty and moderated by the organization’s CEO Tina Descovich and WHO NewsRadio Host Simon Conway, the debate also touched on topics like Iowans’ health, the absence of one of the candidates, U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, and more.
Candidates agreed that both education and higher education in Iowa need to be reformed, with eastern Iowa farmer and businessman Zach Lahn saying the issue needs to be framed as a “generational fight for the institutions in our society.” He and other candidates pointed at “the left” as targeting education to indoctrinate children, something Lahn said they have been “tremendously successful” at.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Lahn is running on an “Iowa first” agenda, with a focus on education, border security and supporting farms. The Republican candidate has not held political office but worked previously for a Colorado state senator, Republican campaigns in Iowa and conservative political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.
“Public school is to promote civic virtue, to understand the principles of faith in our country and our culture, and that’s what it will be when I am governor,” Lahn said.
Brad Sherman, a Republican state representative from 2023-2025, businessman and faith leader, said the “concept of God” needs to be put back in schools, and putting the Ten Commandments in classrooms is a good place to start. God gave children to their parents and not the state, Sherman said, and parents should have complete control.
Sherman states on his campaign website he is committed to “restoring adherence to the Constitution and restoring the foundational principles that made America a great nation and Iowa a great state.”
Parental rights were a focus for both Moms for Liberty and the candidates, with each candidate offering their support of parents deciding where and what their students learn. Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, touted his authorship of parental rights legislation, which includes rights he said everyone agreed on until “three seconds ago.” Parents have the “fundamental right to raise their children in education,” he said.
Andrews also suggested doing away with the current common core education rules and restoring state-specific education standards, including adding phonics, where the association between spoken and written sounds is taught, to classrooms.
The five priorities listed on Andrews’s website include eliminating property taxes and combating inflation, parental rights in education, defending landowners and private property, championing mental health and health care freedom and protecting “life, liberty and traditional values.”
Former Iowa Department of Administrative Services director Adam Steen said during the debate funding of public schools isn’t the problem but ideology is, as well as the “downright evil” requirements being pushed on students.
“The line” for Steen was when his son’s teacher asked them to purchase a book titled “Jacob’s New Dress,” about a boy who begins to wear a dress to school. Teachers are sometimes forced to incorporate materials like these into classrooms, he said, adding he believes schools should instead teach real-world skills, vocational studies and industrial arts.
“I believe that this isn’t on the backs of teachers, it’s on the backs of those that are putting these standards upon our teachers and forcing it down our children’s throats,” Steen said.
Steen described himself at the launch event for his gubernatorial run as “the faith guy,” as well as a “Make America Great Again guy.” The Republican resigned from his position in August in order to enter the race and states on his campaign website he is pro-life, pro-Iowa, pro-property rights and pro-family.
Branching off from school choice for parents, Steen said schools should have a say in how teachers are trained. Universities should offer degree tracks in “classical education” for students, he said, and universities should not promote diversity, equity and inclusion.
Sherman suggested that teachers be given some form of test to ensure they can “do the job” while not needing to go through traditional university training.
Lahn said the value proposition of a college education is “decreasing precipitously,” with schools talking to students about postsecondary options other than attending a university.
Universities are “digging their own grave” while getting a lot of money from the state, and Lahn proposed overturning the Iowa Board of Regents and pulling funding from universities that refuse to stop teaching “woke indoctrination.” He said he would give the money instead to veteran support programs he pitched during the debate, such as trade schools and farm programs.
Iowa’s medical needs
Moderators also asked lawmakers about the medical issues facing Iowans, from cancer rates to vaccine concerns.
Lahn, Sherman and Andrews all stated the need for additional, independent research on the causes of Iowa’s growing cancer rates in order to understand the problem fully and begin to identify solutions. Andrews mentioned $1 million in state funding provided to the University of Iowa for cancer research but said that didn’t include pediatric cancers, and said one suggestion to address that was to put in another $3 million.
Lahn laid the blame on agriculture companies who aren’t truthful about what their chemicals are doing to Iowans, and said he wouldn’t allow them to operate in Iowa unless they can show through research that their products are not harmful.
“It is the generational issue of our time, and we have to confront it head on,” Lahn said.
Steen refused to lay the blame on farmers, citing radon, plane deicer and golf courses as other areas that could be impacting cancer rates. He said this is a years-long issue to solve, and he wants to bring the experts to the table to solve it, no matter their political affiliation.
When asked about mRNA vaccines, Lahn, Sherman and Andrews all committed to banning them in the state, pointing back to issues during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Steen, who said his father got diabetes and cancer after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and later died, said he would consider a ban.
Feenstra criticized for skipping debate
Feenstra was invited to the debate but did not join, indicated by the empty podium Moms for Liberty placed on stage. Each of the candidates criticized his absence.
Steen said if Feenstra is the Republican nominee, Iowa would end up with Democrat Rob Sand as a governor and Iowa would be “toast.” Feenstra was in Iowa Tuesday, Andrews said, and the fact that he didn’t show up felt like he was disregarding Iowans.
“I’m not trying to cuss, but it’s like throwing a middle finger at all of you,” Andrews said. “He doesn’t care.”
Lahn said he doesn’t believe that Feenstra was too intimidated to come to the debate stage Tuesday — he’s instead following a method that says if you get enough establishment money, you get to skip everything else.
“Randy Feenstra has a lot of money, he has a lot of people behind him, but in Iowa, it doesn’t take that much money if you’re willing to work hard,” Sherman said.

Some of this week’s games have been postponed, but the back half of the week seems like it should be good to go, so let’s catch you up on what happened between January 19 and January 25, before play resumes later this week.  
 
Howard puts together an undefeated week
The Wildcats earned a pair of victories last week defeating Mt. Pleasant on Tuesday and Salesianum on Friday. Senior guard Nicholas Baysah was integral in both wins scoring a game high 18 points against the Green Knights and a team high 21 against Sallies. The Wildcats are 5-1 in their last six games and in all but two of them Baysah led the team in scoring. He currently leads the team in total points this season with 233. Howard will play Newark High School on Thursday and then take on Middletown, Saturday, in a game that was originally scheduled for this Tuesday.
MOT Charter gets over .500 with 2-0 week
The Mustangs broke a streak of three straight losses with a pair of victories over Newark Charter and Delaware Military Academy last week. The Mustangs scored a combined 128 points across their two wins last week receiving scoring contributions from almost every player to touch the court. Senior Kaden Briscoe paced the offense against the Patriots scoring a team high 17 points while getting double-digit scoring performances from three of his teammates. MOT showcased its defensive prowess against the Seahawks holding them to a season low 20 points, earning its seventh victory of the season.

The Spartans increased their winning streak to five games with wins over Red Lion, Archmere and the Charter School of Wilmington, last week. The Spartans bookended their win against the Red Lions with a pair of 21 point quarters scoring 72 points in the win, last Tuesday. On Thursday, the school celebrated Smitty Strong Night honoring the life and legacy of former athletic director and baseball coach, Matt Smith. The Spartans were led by sophomore Dylan Bromwell and senior Nathan Meyer. The duo combined for 29 points in a nine point win over Archmere. The Spartans finished the week with a ten point victory over the Forces, improving to a game over .500 this season.  
Three teams go one and done in the win column
St. Elizabeth, Seaford and Conrad all earned a victory last week taking on a singular foe in that span. The Vikings defeated Archmere in their lone game last week, winning by double digits. Senior Emmanuel Matagaro led the team in scoring with 18 points adding five rebounds and two assists to his stat line as well. The Blue Jays defeated Lake Forest last Tuesday improving their winning streak to five games. Seaford had eight different players score in the win. The Redwolves earned a double digit victory over DMA in their lone game last week breaking a stretch of three straight losses.

Howard’s defense helps earn a pair of wins
The Wildcats earned two victories early last week defeating MOT Charter on Monday, and Mt. Pleasant on Tuesday. Howard’s defense played an important role in both games holding its two opponents under 20 points in each game. On the offensive end, senior guard Lykira Davis led the Wildcats in scoring both games combining for 37 points across the two games. Davis is second on the team in scoring behind freshman Kennedi Miller, but together the two have combined for over 250 points this season. The Wildcats are scheduled to play two games this week against Newark High School on Thursday and Middletown on Friday — this game was originally scheduled for Tuesday.
Newark Charter earns a pair of double digit wins
The Patriots followed the same scheduling format earning victories over William Penn and MOT Charter last Monday and Tuesday. Newark Charter’s defense shined in its victory over the Colonials, Monday, accumulating 21 steals and three blocked shots. The offense was led by senior Imani Harrell and sophomore Addison Palsgrove scoring 16 points each in the win. The Patriots’ defense carried over into their game against the Mustangs, Tuesday, reaching double digit steals for the second game in a row. This time the offensive attack was led by sophomore Mia Lang scoring a game high 20 points to go along with six rebounds. Newark Charter was scheduled to play twice this week, but because of the inclement weather the only game on the schedule is a matchup against St. Mark’s on Friday at the Chase Center for the SL24 Basketball Classic. 
Cape Henlopen starts four game home stand with victory
The Vikings earned a pair of wins last week defeating Sussex Tech and Polytech to increase their winning streak to four games. Cape Henlopen’s defense held the Ravens to 13 points in the first half in its win last Tuesday, earning a double digit advantage before halftime. Senior Amalia Fruchtman led the team in scoring with 20 points knocking down nine shots. Fruchtman scored 23 in Cape Henlopen’s win over Polytech last Thursday, kicking off a streak of four straight home games. The Vikings are scheduled to take on Dover and Appoquinimink later this week. 
Middletown continues winning ways with 2-0 week
The Cavaliers increased their winning streak to six games with wins against the Charter School of Wilmington and Appoquinimink last week. Middletown’s defense played well in its game against the Forces holding Charter School of Wilmington under ten points in all but one quarter. The Cavaliers’ defense put together another strong showing against the Jaguars holding their offense under ten points in every quarter. Middletown was able to earn a two point victory due in part to a 12 point third quarter that gave the team a two point lead they never relinquished. The Cavaliers will play back to back games at the end of the week facing William Penn and Howard on Thursday and Friday.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_fki0hwfki0hwfki0.png,,,2026-01-27 22:57:19.197498

Janet Mills gives her final State of the State address on Jan. 27, 2026. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)In her final state of the state speech Tuesday evening, Gov. Janet Mills proposed several measures designed to help Mainers weather a challenging economy, including a new round of direct relief payments and investments in housing and education. She also raised concern about the ongoing impacts of the Trump administration, from heightened immigration enforcement to threatened health care access.
Mills, the first woman elected governor of Maine, has led the state through the COVID-19 pandemic and the deadliest shooting in state history. She has also publicly rebuked President Donald Trump on several issues, from telling the president “see you in court” when he threatened Maine over its inclusive policies supporting transgender athletes to, most recently, decrying federal immigration enforcement in the state.
On Tuesday, Mills bookended her speech by pushing back on the administration’s operation in Maine, which allegedly is targeting people who have committed crimes but has also detained lawfully present immigrants and threatened volunteer activists. 
“Tonight, I say to the people of Maine: We will not be intimidated. We will not be silenced,” she said to applause. “And to anyone outside these halls, including any federal officials, I say: if you seek to harm Maine people, you will have to go through me first.”
Republican leaders have opposed Mills’ challenge to Trump’s immigration enforcement strategy. In a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said the solution to the violence we’ve seen from agents in Minnesota and elsewhere is to “bring down the temperature across the board,” referring to the governor’s rhetoric about the operation. 
After federal agents fatally shot 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday, Mills said she requested that Trump meet with her “so that I can demand in person that his administration withdraw these untrained and reckless ICE agents in Maine and across the country.”
She said these agents “are stoking fear in communities, arresting legally present people, including law enforcement officials, and who pose a grave threat to public safety.”
Affordability
During the address, Mills announced several initiatives she plans to propose through her supplemental budget to lower costs, including a $70 million investment in affordable housing, making free community college permanent, and providing $300 “affordability relief” checks to about 725,000 Mainers. 
Together, Mills said, the proposals are aimed at providing immediate financial relief while addressing long-term cost drivers tied to housing, education and workforce shortages.
Earlier on Tuesday, Republican leaders from the House of Representatives and Senate laid blame on the Democratic administration for failing to address the affordability crisis. 
“The accomplishments of these last seven years have been that Maine has become unaffordable. Mainers are at the breaking point,” said House of Representatives Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R- Winter Harbor).“The state of the state now is abysmal failure.”

The relief checks, which her administration first offered in 2021 in response to the pandemic, would be funded through Maine’s so-called “rainy day fund” and capped by income. 
Mills made her case for the direct payments, calling them “the fastest way to help households manage rising prices for groceries and other essentials.”
Housing affordability emerged as another central focus, as Mills outlined a proposal to build more than 800 new homes and highlighted the nearly $315 million her administration has spent on new units, mobile home parks and affordable rental housing over her two terms as governor. 
Education
The final part of Mills’ affordability package included making community college free. 
The program, first introduced as a time-limited scholarship in 2022, allowed all recent high school graduates to attend one of Maine’s seven community colleges for free, even if they don’t qualify for federal financial aid. The pilot has led to increased enrollment in community colleges and even contributed to an increase in transfer students attending the University of Maine System, but was left in limbo after lawmakers did not fund it for the 2026 school year. 
“The free community college program has made a life changing difference for thousands of Maine young people,” Mills said, making her case for the second time for the Legislature to permanently fund the program, as it was included in her budget last year, but not funded.
Gov. Mills requesting $2.25M for reproductive health providers that lost Medicaid funding

Mills also renewed her commitment for the state to meet its obligation to pay 55% of the cost of public education, which Maine did for the first time in 2022.
If the state does not fund its share, school budgets have to rely more heavily on local property taxes. Recently, at least a dozen school budgets across Maine failed to pass, with local voters rejecting proposed tax increases. Mills is asking for $46 million in the supplemental budget to maintain the state share of education costs.
The governor also addressed falling test scores, which hit an all-time low in 2024, according to a national snapshot of math and reading assessments. As a response, Maine invested in a more hands-on approach that includes helping districts identify evidence-based teaching materials and offering professional development for teachers to include families in learning plans.  
Mills also proposed a state-wide cell phone ban in schools, which almost 75% of adults across the country support, according to a Pew Research Center poll.
Health care
Mills, who is running for U.S. Senate, used her speech to advocate for universal health care. 
“What health care really needs in this country right now is not a series of band-aids, it needs major surgery,” she said. “Each individual state cannot, and should not, be left alone to grapple with this national crisis.”

However, despite increasing health care costs and rural hospital closures, the only health care-related proposal she rolled out Tuesday evening is $2.25 million for Maine-based reproductive health care providers that lost federal Medicaid funding.
Several Republican legislators left the chamber after the announcement, meant to buoy Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, which both lost millions in federal funding due to a provision in congressional Republicans’s spending package passed this summer.
Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin) told a news station that he walked out because he could not support the spending MIlls was proposing. “We kept hearing all the money she was giving away and all the money she was taking out of the rainy day fund,” he said. “And then when it got down to it, it was more about abortions and more about killing babies. It was just more than you could take.”

Video of the event shows Omar, a Minneapolis Democrat, cock her fist to launch a haymaker as the man’s tackled by officers.
After the incident, she went on talking to constituents.
In a statement, her office said, “The congresswoman is OK. She continued with her town hall because she doesn’t let bullies win.”
After the town hall, Omar wrote on X, “I’m a survivor so this small agitator isn’t going to intimidate me from doing my work…. Grateful to my incredible constituents who rallied behind me. Minnesota strong.”
Omar has been the subject of relentless Republican vitriol since her 2018 election, including by President Donald Trump in recent weeks. He’s called her “garbage” and said she should be jailed or sent to her native Somalia. While announcing on Monday that he’d be changing personnel to carry out his federal immigration crackdown here — widely viewed as an acknowledgmetn of error following the killing of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers — Trump also threw in a shot at Omar and her family’s newfound wealth.
Omar responded in kind: “Sorry, Trump, your support is collapsing and you’re panicking,” she wrote on X. “Right on cue, you’re deflecting from your failures with lies and conspiracy theories about me.

Murphy federal courthouse is shown in Minneapolis Friday, May 17, 2024. Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer.U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement released the detainee at the center of a growing rift between the Trump administration and Minnesota courts Tuesday, bowing to pressure from the chief judge of the federal district court here.   
On Monday, Judge Patrick Schiltz took what he admitted was the “extraordinary step” of ordering ICE’s acting director to release the man, who is identified in court documents as Juan T.R. — or face contempt proceedings. 
“The court’s patience is at an end… the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote in a brief order. 
Schiltz said acting ICE director Todd Lyons, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE’s top local official, David Easterwood, had failed to comply with “dozens” of court orders in recent weeks. 
Schiltz is a noted figure in conservative legal circles, making his sharp order all the more notable. He was appointed by former President George W. Bush and clerked for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, an originalist firebrand who died suddenly in 2016.
The last straw for Schiltz was the officials’ failure to follow a Jan. 14 order to grant a timely bond hearing for a petitioner identified in court documents as Juan T.R., who Schiltz said remained in custody as of Friday. The Monday order excoriated Lyons and his colleagues for causing “significant hardship” for Minnesota residents caught up in the federal dragnet, many of whom “have lawfully lived and worked in the United States for years and done absolutely nothing wrong,” he emphasized. 
Schiltz described scenarios in which detainees were held longer than necessary; removed to detention facilities elsewhere in the country; or released hundreds or even thousands of miles from home with no arrangements made for their return. He ordered Lyons to appear in his Minneapolis courtroom on Friday afternoon “to show cause why he should not be held in contempt” — unless the government affirmed that it had released Juan T.R. beforehand. 
Juan T.R.’s attorney, Graham Ojala-Barbour, told NBC News on Tuesday  that his client had been released in Texas. Ojala-Barbour identified the man as Juan Tobay Robles, an Ecuadorian national who entered the U.S. as a minor nearly 30 years ago.
Schiltz’s order came amid a flurry of legal and political developments related to Operation Metro Surge, the ongoing federal law enforcement offensive in Minnesota.
Late Tuesday, the Ecuadorian government filed a protest with U.S. officials after an ICE agent attempted to enter its consulate in Minneapolis in apparent violation of international law. It’s unclear whether the incident is related to the Juan T.R. case.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Monday that President Trump told them some federal agents would leave the Twin Cities this week. Trump’s “border czar,” Tom Homan, replaced Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino as the top Washington-based immigration official on the ground in Minnesota and met with Walz and Frey.
Frey and Walz both said they would work with Trump and federal agencies on legitimate law enforcement matters.
Also Monday, the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul asked a different federal judge to halt Operation Metro Surge in a lengthy hearing. Judge Katherine Menendez, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, did not immediately issue a ruling in that case.
Meanwhile, Washington Democrats and the labor union representing more than 800,000 federal workers dialed up pressure on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and others associated with the administration’s hardline immigration policy, following the killing this month of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. 
The American Federation of Government Employees demanded the resignation last night of Noem and Stephen Miller, the longtime White House advisor seen as an architect of polarizing policies like Trump’s first-term “Muslim ban” and the the current mass deportation effort. New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the top Democrat in the U.S. House, threatened Noem with impeachment if Trump does not fire her first.
Two Republican senators — Thom Tillis of North Carolina and  Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — also called on Noem to resign, with the former referring to Noem’s  “amateurish assistant-manager-sort of thought processes,” NBC News reported.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_6205-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 21:57:24.006390

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Officials with an oversight board for Maryland’s morticians and funeral services reported to lawmakers Tuesday that a significant backlog of inspections has been cleared, after unsanitary conditions at a Charles County crematorium mired the board in controversy a year ago.
Erika Malone, executive director of the Maryland State Board of Morticians and Funeral Directors, reported that by November 2025, the board was able to clear a backlog of over 300 facility inspections that are supposed to take place every two years but didn’t occur on time.
Malone also reported several other administrative changes to help improve the board’s complaint process and licensing delays that were brought to light last year.
While lawmakers with the House’s Health Occupations subcommittee told Malone the board was “heading in the right direction,” she insisted that more action needs to occur.
She said she’s implemented what changes she can as executive director and is asking for legislative action to address some regulations and challenges that are delaying further improvements.
“I wanted to focus on the improvements and everything that we’ve accomplished in a short amount of time with limited staffing, limited resources,” she said. “But if we had the resources, then we can accomplish certain statutory state changes that are necessary for our board.”
The update comes almost a year after the board came under scrutiny for findings at a Charles County-based crematorium. Several board members resigned last year following the revocation of licensing for Heaven Bound Cremation Services.
Mortician board members resign under pressure

In 2024, a state inspector found “human bodies in cardboard boxes stacked on top of each other with no support between the boxes; human bodies in ripped body bags with arms and legs hanging out of the body bags; human remains that were not being stored at temperatures below 40F; and blood on the refrigeration unit and bodily fluids on the floor.”
Malone admitted that the conditions at Heaven Bound occurred “unfortunately, under my authority.”
“These issues posed an immediate risk to public health and compromised the dignity of the deceased,” Malone told the subcommittee Tuesday. “At the time of the inspection, I want to make known that the board only had one investigator that was responsible for overseeing approximately 300 funeral establishments statewide.”
In wake of the problems reported at Heaven Bound, Gov. Wes Moore (D) ordered a “top to bottom review” of the board, naming Charles Scheeler, senior counsel at DLA Piper and a former federal prosecutor, to lead the review.
Malone said that the board has taken up some of Scheeler’s recommendations.
“Since that time, we have implemented significant administrative improvements,” Malone said, “including transitioning inspections and licensing to fully online systems, where it’s easier for people to do an inspection, to request an inspection, for us to do our complaints and whatnot.”
The board also increased communication with county health departments to notify the local agencies if a complaint may have public health concerns. It is conducting more in-person meetings and its Complaints Committee now meets every two weeks, as opposed to monthly.
The board is also contracting a part-time investigator to help keep up with annual facility inspections.
But some changes must go through the legislature. Malone said the board is still facing “critical challenges” that would need to be addressed by legislation.
One of the issues the board faces is inconsistent funding due to the fee scheduling currently in statute. The independent board is funded solely with fees on the industry.

“It has odds and even years for particular licenses,” Malone said. “And certain licenses are renewed on an even year, which is a majority of our licenses. And then we only have one license, the mortician’s license, that’s renewed every year.
“That is based on our statute, so it’s another thing that needs to be addressed in a bill,” Malone said.
The board’s disciplinary actions are also slowed down if the facility or person appeals the decision, according to Charlotte Hoffman, chair of the board’s Complaint Committee.
She said that in that an aggrieved party can petition for a judicial review of the suspension or revocation of license, which places a stay on the board’s actions.
“Every other board can summarily suspend licenses and then that licensee gets to appeal if the board is found to have acted inappropriately,” Hoffman said. “In our case, that order is immediately suspended. And so, you can have people who are doing rather egregious things who we effectively cannot take action of summarily suspending them because it has no effect.”
Del. Samuel I. Rosenberg (D- Baltimore City), who chairs the subcommittee, reminded members that the deadline for a guaranteed hearing on proposed legislation is Feb. 12.

The kickoff was at an Educare of Omaha at Indian Hill, 3110 W St., on Oct. 30, 2023. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska is looking to require students to retake third grade if they fail a state-mandated reading test — with some exceptions. 
The proposal is from the Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, carried by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee. Legislative Bill 1050 would require schools to help students who fail to meet the new benchmarks with an “intensive acceleration class” featuring a smaller student-teacher ratio to focus on improving students’ reading level. 
Students could be held back once between third and fourth grade, determined by three reading assessments during the school year. The new requirements would begin fall of 2027. 
Nebraska students in kindergarten through second grade would also take three reading assessments three times during the school year to determine whether they were at the correct reading level. Students receiving special education services or accommodations would be exempt under the proposal. 
The proposal is a part of the governor’s focus on education for this session.
Trump Education Secretary Linda McMahon posted her support for Pillen’s proposal on social media Tuesday, saying, “Accountability partnered with focused tutoring for students who need additional help will provide an education Nebraska’s students deserve.”

The bill had its hearing before the Education Committee on Tuesday. Both supporters and opponents of the bill looked toMississippi as an example. Mississippi turned around its near-dead-last ranking on national tests in 2013 to a top 10 state for fourth-grade reading. It has been dubbed the “Mississippi Miracle.”
Supporters and Murman used the southern state and its “miracle” to say that retention was the reason it worked, while opponents said it was extra services that led to success. Some of Murman’s committee members hinted that the bill might need some tweaks. 
“A child who cannot read by third grade is not failing the system. The system is failing that child,” Heather Schmidt of Lincoln, a supporter of the bill, said during the hearing. 
Schmidt said the proposal should be strengthened by amending the bill so schools are required to screen for dyslexia, an issue she and her daughter, who has dyslexia, have asked the Legislature to provide more support around. She said the bill is an “opportunity” to help struggling readers. 
Lisa Schonhoff of Bennington, an elected member of the State Board of Education speaking in her personal capacity, expressed her support of the governor’s proposal. The former teacher said “a lot” of parents come to her asking why their children are so behind in reading when she offers outside tutoring.
“Accountability is paramount,”  Schonhoff said. “This is the accountability piece that we need.” 
Other supporters of the proposal said it can help students who need it to catch up. 
Opponents of the bill said holding kids back is ineffective and harmful and questioned if the state has the money for those “acceleration” classes. Stacy Lovelace, for example, said her dad was held back because he didn’t read at grade level. 
“It didn’t make him a better reader or a better student,” Lovelace said. “Instead, it left him with a lifetime of shame and a mantra of ‘I’m stupid.’”
She asked the committee why they are proposing to use “1950s tactics” when there are 21st-century treatments and supports available for kids.
Since 2018, schools have been required to identify K-3 students with reading deficiencies and put them on “reading improvement plans.” That was the result of legislation from then-State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area. In her freshman year in 2017, she initially proposed mandatory holding back of struggling third-grade readers before scaling back.
In his tele-town hall from earlier this month, Pillen said that the state doesn’t need more “self-esteem crap.”
“When third graders can’t read in third grade, they are not going on to fourth grade,” Pillen said last week. “I believe this policy will help educators.”

Josh Shapiro joined the city of Philadelphia in a lawsuit Tuesday challenging the Trump administration’s removal of an exhibit recognizing President George Washington’s history with slavery from Independence National Historical Park.
The National Park Service last week removed interpretive signage at the former site of the president’s house on Independence Mall, where visitors flock to see Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. The exhibit included historical details of the nine people enslaved in the house where Washington and First Lady Martha Washington lived.
Mayor Cherelle Parker’s administration sued Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and the U.S. Department of the Interior on Thursday, claiming the exhibit and others in the park are covered by an agreement between the city and National Park Service that requires advance notice of changes to exhibits.

In an amicus brief filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Shapiro notes his administration has a strong interest in ensuring historical monuments in Pennsylvania present an accurate portrayal of the commonwealth’s history. That’s especially important given the approach of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence this summer. 
The brief also says Shapiro has a compelling interest in protecting the role of state and local governments from “the abuses of federal executive power typified by the conduct at issue in this case.”
“Donald Trump will take any opportunity to rewrite and whitewash our history — but he picked the wrong city and the wrong Commonwealth,” Shapiro said. “In Pennsylvania, we learn from our history, even when it’s painful. We don’t erase it or pretend it didn’t happen.”
The brief notes the history of slavery in Pennsylvania is recorded at numerous other historic attractions across the state, including more than 70 historic markers maintained by the Pennsylvania Museum and Historical Commission.
“Those displays aren’t just signs — they represent our shared history, and if we want to move forward as a nation, we have to be willing to tell the full story of where we came from,” Shapiro said in a statement announcing the filing Tuesday.
The exhibit was created more than 20 years ago as the result of “a concerted, community-led effort to ensure that the history displayed at Independence Mall is complete and faithfully told — the good and the bad,” the brief says.

The Pennsylvania House of Representatives had a role in its beginnings after lawmakers passed a resolution in 2002 urging the park service to tell the stories of the people enslaved by Washington and to place a permanent plaque at the site.
State Reps. Jared Solomon and Ben Waxman, both Philadelphia Democrats, and City Councilmember Rue Landau released a statement noting Tuesday was World Holocaust Memorial Day and warning of the consequences of erasing history. Survivors have endured movements by people in power to question and discredit their first-hand accounts of the Holocaust. Others, have tried to glorify Nazi leaders.
“That is how we felt — and we can only imagine how the Black community felt,” they said of the memorial’s removal. 
“This year, America celebrates its 250th birthday. It’s time to confront our past, engage with our present, and chart a new course for our future. The American story cannot be told without the Black experience — each shapes and informs the other in an ongoing dialogue about what it truly means to be American,” the statement said.
In the brief, Shapiro asserts the Trump administration is “whitewashing history,” by dismantling the exhibit. It notes President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March directing the Interior Department to scrub monuments of “descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times).”
Instead, the order directed, monuments should focus on Americans’ greatest accomplishments and the nation’s natural beauty. Shapiro’s brief argues that is at odds with the Trump administration’s re-installation of monuments to confederate military leaders from the Civil War. 
“Without judicial intervention, the federal government will be permitted to selectively bury aspects of history that address slavery while celebrating individuals who fought to preserve slavery, all under the arbitrary implementation of the same rationale,” the brief says.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/slavery-philadelphia-2-1024x698.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 20:57:55.328760

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island should move forward with a public medical school at the University of Rhode Island (URI), an expensive move but one that could hopefully counteract Rhode Island’s aging and shrinking primary care workforce, a special legislative commission decided Tuesday.
The 21-member commission formed in 2024 voted unanimously to adopt the recommendations of a final report released at its meeting. The 32-page report outlines how a state-supported, MD-granting school could graduate its inaugural cohort as early as 2029.
“We have a severe shortage here,” Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barrington Democrat and nurse practitioner who co-chaired the commission, said of the state’s primary care workforce during a press briefing ahead of the commission’s final meeting.
“There’s been so many personal stories about people losing their primary care provider and not being able to find someone new, not having two or three primary care providers in as many years as they get bounced from one to the other,” Lauria told reporters.
The report was informed by a year and a half of commission meetings, as well as a $150,000 feasibility study conducted by Kansas City, Missouri-based consultancy Tripp-Umbach and released in October 2025.
The release of the new report — and its $20 million recommendation for initial state support with much more spending to come in subsequent years’ budgets — brings the commission’s work to an end. But the report lays out a plan for another permanent commission to shepherd the way forward to solving Rhode Island’s primary care crisis. The new panel would be charged with developing “comprehensive graduate medical education and workforce strategy to produce and retain skilled and committed primary care clinicians.”
The commission’s estimate of the state’s primary care workforce is imprecise, giving a range from 641 to about 1,200 doctors. But that headcount is going to change with a third of the state’s primary care providers over age 60.
According to a survey by commission member Dr. Michael Fine cited in the report, about 26% of providers said they aim to retire within the next six years. Plugging those numbers into the state’s current age distribution, an estimated 55 to 110 physicians could retire annually.
In academic year 2022-2023, only 15 of the 106 primary care residency program graduates in Rhode Island planned to remain living and working in the state, according to the report. 
“Although 91% of practices report accepting new patients, fewer than half accept patient transfers or newly arrived residents, indicating that true access to primary care is far more limited than these topline numbers suggest,” the report reads. 
Among Rhode Islanders who could soon lack a primary care doctor is Senate President Valarie Lawson. 
“My primary care physician is retiring at the end of March,” Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, said during the briefing. “So we know that we need to recruit physicians here and we need to retain them.”
Joining Lauria and Lawson Tuesday at the briefing were Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone and Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian.
$20 million investment to start  
A new medical school would begin with $20 million in seed funding from the state, with fundraising efforts beginning this year for alternate financing sources — including a potential voter bond — for the additional  $175 million recommended to open the school by 2029 with 50 initial students. 
“It is definitely my hope that the $20 million be part of this year’s budget,” Lauria said of the fiscal year 2027 budget, which will arrive sometime in June. 
The school would also need an approximately $22.5 million-per-year line item in the state budget, the report claims. 
“I think that it’s an economic investment, and I think that we do lots of economic investments that don’t have the potential payback that this one does,” Lauria said when asked about potential opposition to the recurring funding in an always-crunched state budget.  
Lawson called a medical school an investment and “a necessity.”

The commission’s report states: “While modest start-up deficits are anticipated in the early years, these are projected to be offset over time by tuition revenue, clinical partnerships, research growth, and operational efficiencies.”
The commission reiterated the feasibility study’s estimates that the school could exert “a powerful economic ripple effect” and glean $196 million in annual economic activity, create over 1,300 jobs, and contribute $4.5 million in state and local tax revenue each year once the school is fully operational.
The report suggests the school would have a $16 million surplus annually by 2037.
That those numbers reside in a somewhat far-off horizon has drawn criticism from state and health care leaders. Lauria and Lawson dismissed the naysayers Tuesday when taking questions from reporters. 
“We can walk and chew gum,” Lauria said, agreeing the state can best address the primary care shortage through a mix of reforms in the near and far future.
The URI school, Lauria said, is only one part and “is definitely looking ahead, but if we don’t do that, then we’re constantly in the rear,” Lauria said. 
“We’d be negligent not to look in the future for 10 years,” Lawson said. 
When asked what guardrails would be installed to prevent the project from slipping on cost or timeline, Lauria pivoted to another report recommendation: creating another legislative commission.
Added Lauria: “A year and a half ago, when we started getting together, I would not have guessed that, as of the last commission meeting, we had a unanimous vote that we were going to start this conclusion of our report with, ‘We recommend a medical school at URI.’”
The commission also recommends expanding the state Health Professional Loan Repayment Program and creating a primary care scholarship program that would come attached with a minimum five-year service obligation in primary care. 
“You need someone to come and work for at least five years before you can reliably count on them staying,” Lauria said. “So those are things that we need to do no matter what. I wouldn’t even put that as a cost of the medical school, because if we want to have a primary care workforce in the state, then we’re going to have to do that.”
Incentives are needed because primary care doctors go into the field knowing they’ll make less than their specialty counterparts, Lauria said.
“One of the reasons that primary medical students do not go into primary care is that they come out of school with such a large debt load that they have no option but to go into the higher paying specialties,” she said.
Lauria didn’t see a public medical school at URI as competition for Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School. 
“They have different missions,” she said. “Brown is doing what most of their peer organizations do, they have a heavy focus on research, and they’re not really looking toward primary care as much as they once did.”

“Accountability goes all the way to the top, and I think you have a secretary right now that needs to be accountable to the chaos and in some of the tragedy that we have seen,” she added.
Her comments come after a massive surge of federal agents has been operating in Minneapolis as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Their actions include an unknown number of arrests and two fatal shootings in three weeks, prompting widespread protests. 
Murkowski voted to confirm Noem’s appointment last January. Noem faces mounting bipartisan criticism after House Democrats co-sponsored articles of impeachment against her.
Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan and Rep. Nick Begich III did not immediately respond to questions about Noem’s leadership from the Alaska Beacon on Tuesday.
Murkowski has not supported calls from a faction of progressive Democrats in Congress to defund the agency. She voted in support of the Republican-drafted budget package earlier this year that sent almost $85 billion to the agency, giving it a larger budget than the U.S. Marine Corps.
“You’ve got all these cries to say, ‘We can’t give another penny to ICE.’ Well, the fact of the matter is ICE has the resources that they will need. What it comes down to is: What are they doing with the money? And that’s where it comes to the management, that’s when it comes to who is controlling it, that’s when it comes to who is ultimately in charge and accountable,” she said.
Congressional response to ICE action in Minneapolis
Alaska’s congressional delegation is split in its response to the ICE action and the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend. 
In a Sunday statement, Murkowski called for a “comprehensive, independent investigation” of the killing, which she said is necessary to build back public trust. Her statement called on Congressional committees to fulfill their oversight duties in hearings. 
“ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties,” she said in the statement.
“The tragedy and chaos the country is witnessing in Minneapolis is shocking,” Murkowski’s statement said, and added that the killing of another U.S. citizen “should raise serious questions within the administration about the adequacy of immigration-enforcement training and the instructions officers are given on carrying out their mission.”
Sullivan’s office is closely monitoring reports out of Minneapolis following the fatal shooting,  according to a statement through spokesperson Devyn Shea. Sullivan stopped short of calling for an independent investigation of ICE actions. 
“He believes we should gather all the facts and investigate the incident before drawing conclusions — to ensure accountability, restore public trust, and prevent future confrontations that result in loss of life,” his spokesperson wrote.
“Senator Sullivan strongly supports our law enforcement and their ability to do their jobs. He also believes that any loss of life is tragic and hopes that the temperature in Minnesota on both sides can be lowered and that the situation between protestors and law enforcement deescalates and the violence dissipates,” the statement said.
Silver Prout, a spokesperson for Begich’s office, said he will not speculate, but “allow facts to be established through appropriate investigative processes.”
“Congressman Begich supports law enforcement’s ability to carry out their duties safely and without interference from agitators,” Prout wrote on Tuesday. “This includes a responsibility to ensure transparency and accountability in the commission of those duties.”
Prout said Begich supports “appropriate” Congressional oversight of federal law enforcement and that safe communities are a top priority of Begich’s.
“If anything, recent events have underscored the need for additional funding to ensure law enforcement has the tools, personnel, and training needed to complete their job,” she wrote.
Congressional candidates speak out
Some congressional candidates have issued statements in response to the violence and unrest in Minneapolis. Former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat challenging Sullivan, called for an independent investigation into the death of Alex Pretti, as well as increased Congressional oversight for ICE and funding for local law enforcement in Alaska.
“Nothing is more important than the safety of our communities,” she wrote on social media on Monday.
“What’s happening right now in the Lower 48 does nothing to make us safer here in Alaska. In Alaska, we respect the rule of law and lawfully carrying a firearm never justifies deadly force by federal agents,” the post said.
On Monday, the campaign of Democratic candidate Matt Schultz, who is challenging Rep. Begich for Alaska’s sole House seat, called on Congress to respond to the killings of U.S. citizens by ICE.
The statement urged that ICE be withdrawn from Minnesota and for its personnel to be better trained. It accused the Trump administration of deploying them “as a cudgel for settling petty partisan grudges.” 
“I’m troubled by the silence and inaction of too many of our leaders here in Alaska,” the statement said, specifically attacking Begich and another candidate, independent Bill Hill. “It is time to speak up and show up for our fellow Americans, immigrants, and the Bill of Rights.”
Hill’s campaign did not immediately respond to a call from the Alaska Beacon on Tuesday, but told the Anchorage Daily News that he supports an independent investigation of the killing of Alex Pretti.

Stephen Webber, D-Columbia, looks to the Senate dais in a disagreement over Senate rules on Sept. 10, 2025 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Gov. Mike Kehoe withdrew two nominees to the Missouri Ethics Commission Tuesday after Democrats pointed out the appointments were based on a congressional map that Republicans contend is no longer valid. 
Senate Democrats have refused to allow any gubernatorial appointments to come up for a vote for the past two weeks, arguing that their stall tactics are an effort to restore the chamber’s role as the more deliberative body. Republicans say the move is simply political payback for the Senate GOP invoking a rarely-used rule four times last year to shut down debate. 
On Tuesday, Democratic state Sen. Stephen Webber of Columbia raised a formal objection to four nominees to the state’s ethics commission. The appointments are based on congressional districts, Webber noted, and Kehoe relied on the map approved by lawmakers in 2022. 
But Republicans are in court arguing that the newly gerrymandered map — which passed four months ago —  is in effect. And under that map, two nominees live in the 4th District and two live in the 1st District. 
“This was only discovered because we decided to take our time,” Webber said, “and we’ve slowed things down…. I know there are a lot of people frustrated that Democrats are not letting these nominees through. But by doing this vetting, we found problems.”
After Webber’s point of order, Kehoe withdrew two of the nominees. The other two, along with more than 20 other appointments, are still being blocked by a Democratic filibuster. Unless they are approved by the Senate or withdrawn by the governor by Feb. 6, they will be barred from holding those appointments for life.
President Donald Trump began pressuring Missouri Republicans last summer to change the state’s congressional map to give the GOP an edge in seven of the state’s eight districts, up from six they currently hold. Lawmakers approved the gerrymandered map in September.
In December, opponents of the gerrymandered map submitted more than 300,000 signatures to put it on the statewide ballot. For more than a century, dating back to a 1914 Missouri Supreme Court ruling, submitting referendum signatures automatically suspends the challenged law until voters decide its fate or the signatures are invalidated.
But Attorney General Catherine Hanaway and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins have disregarded that precedent, publicly declaring the new map the law of the land. The ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit last month arguing that decision violates the constitution.
Webber agrees with the ACLU that the gerrymandered map is effectively frozen and the 2022 map remains in effect. By relying on the 2022 map for his appointments, Webber contends, Kehoe also agrees.
“The attorney general has asserted the 2022 maps are no longer in effect and the 2025 gerrymandered map is in effect,” Webber said. “We know from the governor’s actions that he doesn’t agree with the attorney general. And he doesn’t agree with President Trump, either… Kehoe is with us on this.”
Kehoe’s spokeswoman said in a Friday afternoon email that the governor made the ethics commission appointments before the new map went into effect on Dec. 11.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_webber2-1024x684.jpg,,,2026-01-27 20:57:55.328760

In a press call U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood hosted Tuesday, Democrats from Colorado said the Trump administration has lied repeatedly about what happened to Pretti on Saturday and called for mass reforms of immigration enforcement in the U.S. 
“What is happening is not what we were sold by (President) Donald Trump about deporting the most dangerous people,” Pettersen said.

Pretti’s death came just two weeks after ICE agents in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three. The killings have sparked nationwide outrage, while Trump’s top advisers rushed to spread false information about Pretti and Good, both of whom the administration smeared as “domestic terrorists” hours after they were killed.
A U.S. Border Patrol agent was involved in a shooting near the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona Tuesday. An off-duty ICE agent shot and killed Keith Porter on New Year’s Eve in Los Angeles. More than 50 people have died while in ICE or CBP custody under Noem, according to Democrats on the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee. The immigration enforcement operations are part of Trump’s mass deportation efforts.
Loss of public trust
U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette of Denver said Noem was never qualified to lead Homeland Security, and her performance is worse than DeGette expected when she was selected and confirmed. 
“She’s cruel and she’s lawless. She refused a court order. She violated public trust. She has no regard for human life or dignity,” DeGette said.

Others on the call included U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, House Assistant Minority Leader Joe Neguse of Lafayette and U.S. Rep. Jason Crow of Aurora. 
If Noem does not resign, Democratic leaders in the House have indicated they will move forward with articles of impeachment against her. 
Pettersen said ICE in its current form has “completely lost the public trust.” If reforms are not made to hold ICE to “strict standards,” the agency must be dismantled, DeGette said.
“There are some enforcement mechanisms that an agency can and should provide at the border, but ICE has gone far, far beyond that, as we’re seeing in Minneapolis and many other U.S. cities,” DeGette said.
Crow said 2025 was the “most lethal year” to be in ICE custody in decades, and recent actions from the agency are “a feature, not a bug” of what the Trump administration envisioned for immigration enforcement. The administration built ICE into a “rogue agency” to “terrorize communities and abuse Americans for the purpose of suppressing dissent and asserting control and power over communities that they perceive as unfriendly.” 
‘Sickening lies’
Pettersen said the recent deaths and the Trump administration’s immediate defense of those killings are shocking. She said Pretti, who was a nurse at a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, was “murdered by our own government” and the administration is “spreading horrific lies about who he was and what happened.” 
Pretti’s parents, Michael and Susan Pretti, live in Pettersen’s district, which covers an area west and southwest of metro Denver. They released a statement calling their son “a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends.”
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” their statement said. “Alex (was) clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs.”
DHS is operating lawlessly with no accountability, Bennet said. ICE agents should be prohibited from wearing masks and detaining children, and warrants must be required, he added. 
“No person in America should have to wonder whether masked men in unmarked cars carrying guns might snatch them from the street, detain their children or kill them on the side of the road,” Bennet said. 
The U.S. Senate this week must vote on a government funding package to avoid a partial government shutdown, but Democrats in the chamber have said they will not support more funding for Homeland Security without additional constraints on federal immigration enforcement.
“If there is a shutdown, it’s going to be because President Trump is so far outside the mainstream of conventional American approaches to the Constitution and law enforcement that he’s unwilling to allow those rules to apply to ICE, and I think that would be a huge mistake on his part,” Bennet said.
Hickenlooper and Bennet said they will not support the legislation in its current form. Bennet called the measure “a blank check” to Noem without sufficient guardrails, transparency or oversight. While Hickenlooper said he sees some Republican senators siding with Democrats to reform ICE operations, Bennet said he is “far less optimistic” and does not see Republicans being willing to stand up to Trump.

New data the US Census Bureau released Tuesday estimated Massachusetts had a population of about 7.15 million at the end of June of last year. That’s a modest increase of about 15,500 people from the prior one-year period, showing that the Bay State was subject to the same national trend of steeply declining inflows from other countries.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts continued to see more people leave for other states than move here from elsewhere within the country, only adding more significance to immigration patterns.
It’s the third year in a row the Census’s so-called “Vintage” population estimates have reflected some growth in the Massachusetts population.
This time, however, the trajectory was close to flat. The 0.2 percent rate of annual population growth in the state was less than a quarter as high as the year prior.
Experts cautioned that a slowdown in immigration could spell economic problems for the Bay State, where foreign-born workers form the bedrock of the workforce.
Doug Howgate, president of the business-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said immigrant employees are integral to fields ranging from cutting-edge research to construction to the service industry.
“Marbled throughout every aspect of our economy — and the aspects that, if we’re going to continue to grow, we need to do well — is immigrant labor,” Howgate said. “That’s not something we can do without.”
The latest data show net domestic outmigration of 33,000, meaning tens of thousands more Massachusetts residents decamped for other states than residents of other states moved here. At the same time, the state saw a net gain from international migration of 40,000, so more people relocated into Massachusetts from other countries than Bay Staters left to live in another nation.
Massachusetts had the fourth-highest rate of net international migration in 2025, trailing only Florida, Washington state, and Washington, DC, according to Census data. It also had the sixth-highest rate of population lost to domestic movement, behind New York, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington, DC, and California. The dual trends underscore the crucial role immigration plays in the state’s population growth and economy.
The combined effect of all migration in Massachusetts netted out to contribute only about 6,900 new residents, the lowest single-year total since the pandemic. Births also outpaced deaths by about 8,400 in the most recent year, forming the rest of the state’s population growth.
Given the perennial debate about whether the state’s high cost of living is driving a surge in “outmigration,” leaders on Beacon Hill might be inclined to let out a small sigh of relief that Massachusetts at least did not land among the five states whose populations shrank.
But the new numbers show a steep drop-off in immigration from last year’s record. In 2024, net international migration added about 78,000 people to the state, nearly twice as many as during the more recent one-year period. (That estimate comes from revised 2024 data published Tuesday; the Census Bureau’s original release last year put net international migration to Massachusetts in that span at about 90,000.)
Howgate called the year-over-year change a “nosedive.”
Massachusetts appears to be affected by the same larger political currents curtailing immigration across the rest of the country.
Nationwide, net international migration peaked at 2.7 million between July 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024, then plummeted to 1.3 million between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025. The Census Bureau called it a “historic decline.”
The most recent period includes roughly the last six months of President Joe Biden’s second term and the first six months of Trump’s return to the White House, during which his administration has dramatically ramped up deportation efforts and sought to slow the flow of new arrivals from other countries.
Demographers expect the plunge to continue. The Census Bureau projected that if current patterns hold, net international migration to the US will fall to about 321,000 between July 1, 2025, and June 30, 2026.
While immigration policy is largely handled at the federal level, the effects on states can be powerful.
For years, immigration has offset or outpaced population Massachusetts lost to domestic outmigration. A 2024 study by Boston University researchers found that immigrants represent about one in five workers in the state.
Meanwhile, elected officials continue to grapple with a shortage of available housing, exorbitant child care costs, and pricey health care and education, all of which have thrust “affordability” onto center stage.
Howgate said the domestic-only numbers newly released by the Census Bureau represent “a step forward, a step back.” Beacon Hill has taken some action on tax relief, encouraging housing development, and investing in transportation infrastructure, but Howgate stressed “you’re not going to see solutions overnight.”
“The story hasn’t really changed,” he said. “We continue to face challenges in making Massachusetts a place that’s attractive and affordable.”
It will be a big week for those closely tracking demographic data. On Thursday, the Census Bureau will follow up its latest population figures by releasing the latest five-year American Community Survey, covering 2019 through 2024, which will offer much more detailed insight into education, housing, labor, and other issue areas.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Irma-Lemus-State-House.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-27 20:57:55.328760

(Photo provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The Trump administration is floating the idea of mining the seafloor off Alaska’s coast.
The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said Tuesday it will soon release a formal “call for information” about possible sales of leases for minerals mining in federal waters off Alaska. The call for information will kick off a 30-day public comment period allowing industry to express interest in such a lease sale.
“Alaska’s offshore holds strategic potential for the minerals that drive American industry, defense and next-generation technologies,” Matt Giacona, BOEM’s acting director, said in a statement. “This Request for Information is a practical first step to gauge interest and identify areas where development could make sense for jobs, investment and national supply chains.”
The push for offshore minerals mining “supports the Trump Administration’s focus on strengthening domestic supply chains and advancing American energy and resource leadership,” the BOEM statement said.
There has never been a minerals lease sale in Alaska’s Outer Continental Shelf, BOEM said.
Some parts of Alaska’s Outer Continental Shelf are relatively shallow, but some are deep enough to fit the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s 200-meter threshold that defines deep-sea mining.
There is a history of offshore gold mining in shallow state waters in one area of Alaska: the Nome region. It is managed by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources’ Division of Mining, Land and Water and conducted through suction dredging, a mechanized process that vacuums up sediments from which gold is sifted.
The Nome offshore mining activity has become famous through a reality TV show called Bering Sea Gold. But that type of mining can be controversial. There is widespread opposition in the Nome area to a proposal to expand underwater mining, and DNR last year denied a permit sought by the company pushing that proposal.
The idea of underwater mining in federal waters drew quick opposition from environmentalists.
“This step toward offshore mining shows that the Trump administration only sees Alaska’s vibrant seafloor as an extraction zone for corporate profit,” Cooper Freeman, Alaska director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “The health and vitality of Alaskan coastal communities are deeply tied to a healthy ocean. Destroying the seafloor by mining puts the entire marine food web in grave danger, from walruses and bearded seals to crab and halibut.” That, in turn, threatens Alaska traditions and economies, he said.
Becca Robbins Gisclair, Ocean Conservancy’s senior director of Arctic and northern waters, also issued a statement.
“This proposal targets the very waters that make Alaska’s fisheries world class. Deep-sea mining in the proposed areas – many of which are protected habitat – should not even be on the table. We cannot trade Alaska’s food, cultures and economy for the new and risky endeavor of deep-sea mining, which we know threatens species both on the seafloor and throughout the water column,” she said in the statement.
There are international implications, Gisclair added. “Deep-sea mining in the Central Arctic Ocean is unprecedented and unworkable. This would be the starting gun for an international scramble to exploit this pristine sea. Deep sea-mining is a losing proposition for Alaska, America and the world,” she said.
BOEM last year suggested leasing for deep-sea mining in two other U.S. regions: American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. The agency last year issued requests for information on underwater mining in those areas. The comment periods have now expired.
The American Samoa deep-sea mining idea drew over 76,000 comments, and nearly 9,000 of them have been published by BOEM. The published comments expressed vigorous opposition to the idea.
“For the life that grows on and around areas targeted for deep-sea mining, the resulting destruction will be comprehensive and irreversible. The deep sea is Earth’s least understood ecosystem—with new species discovered every year—and it is also among its most fragile,” said one of the comments.
But a California-based company called Impossible Metals said BOEM should proceed with a lease sale off American Samoa.
“The United States sits atop an estimated billion‑ton reserve of polymetallic nodules that can underwrite a century of industrial leadership, yet today those resources lie fallow while China races to secure global supply,” said the company’s July 16, 2025, comment letter.

Doug Fiefia told the story of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who died by suicide with the guidance of ChatGPT.
“This was preventable. The AI company rushed out a new version of its model to keep up with its competitor that just released theirs. That rushed version, the one that released early to stay competitive, is the exact model that Adam was using,” Fiefia told a legislative committee on Tuesday. “This was a business decision that put speed and market pressure ahead of safety, and a teenager paid the price.”

His bill would enact the AI Transparency Act, which would mandate that AI developers write and post public safety plans and risk assessments for certain models. It would also protect employees who act as whistleblowers, in addition to banning developers from making misleading statements about risks and establishing civil penalties for violations.
In essence, if there are incidents that affect Utah children, AI companies have to report them to the state.
The House Economic Development and Workforce Services Committee voted unanimously to recommend Fiefia’s proposal and it will now head to the full House for consideration. 
Fiefia, anticipating opposition from tech companies, also highlighted what his bill doesn’t do. 
“No content mandates, no government pre-approval, no micromanaging algorithms. It doesn’t touch development, which means it doesn’t stifle innovation,” Fiefia told the committee.
‘States must act’: Cox pushes for AI regulations ahead of federal preemption talk

Sitting next to Fiefia was actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has been pushing for more AI regulations and visited the state Capitol to ask Utah lawmakers to support the legislation.
While Gordon-Levitt described himself as a “tech enthusiast,” praising the potential of AI to boost productivity and help advance science and medicine, he also pointed out potential harms. 
“It’s all about how we use it, right? So the question is, what are the principles? What are the morals that are guiding the development and the design of this technology?” he said. “And I’ll tell you, from what I’ve learned, to me, there’s only one principle at play right now, It’s making money. That’s it.”
Currently, he said, there isn’t a balance between market incentives and the public good in the AI industry, “because there are virtually no laws governing it.” 
“The federal government hasn’t done anything about this yet, but thank goodness the states are stepping up,” Gordon-Levitt said.
To questions on whether or not his bill would go too far, Fiefia said he already pulled out a third-party mandatory audit and the creation of safety protocol standards. Companies have already committed to advancing safety protocols, and now the state is asking them to post them for everyone to see, Fiefia said. 
The more restrictive piece, he said, is the clear addition of a “child protection plan,” which other states don’t require.
“What we’re asking them to do is just tell us how you’re going to keep our kids safe. Tell us how you’re going to keep the public safe, and then if there’s an incident, you report it,” he said.
Most people participating in public comment were in support of the bill, with some parents expressing concerns about the impacts that technologies like social media have brought to kids, like anxiety and depression. 
However, other groups, like Technet, a network of tech CEOs and senior executives, said the bill “takes an overly prescriptive and untested approach that goes well beyond even states like California, New York have adopted,” by imposing additional requirements and accelerating timelines, according to Andrew Wood, the organization’s executive director for Colorado and the central U.S. 
“The bill improperly conflates system-level issues such as child safety obligations with highly technical frontier model safety requirements,” Wood said. “Combining these distinct issues into a single regulatory framework renders several provisions unworkable and creates regulatory uncertainty that will discourage AI development and deployment in Utah.”

In the year since his inauguration, Trump said the U.S. is “winning like never before” with improved economic prospects, a secure border and a stronger military. He said these changes would be reversed if Democrats win back control in Congress in the upcoming election.
“If we lose the midterms, you’ll lose so many of the things that we’re talking about, so many of the assets that we’re talking about, so many of the tax cuts that we’re talking about, and it would lead to very bad things,” Trump said. “We’ve got to win the midterms. I mean, I’m here because I love Iowa, but I’m here because we’re starting the campaign to win the midterms.”
Trump largely ignores Minnesota immigration controversy
Trump’s visit to Iowa was officially focused on energy and affordability, but it comes as tensions rise over the administration’s immigration crackdown agenda – centered on Department of Homeland Security actions in Iowa’s northern neighboring state, Minnesota.
Trump did say in his speech that many people have “read much about Minnesota, where, unbeknownst to the public, we have brought down crime very substantially.”
He also brought up Minnesota U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American who came to the U.S. with family members as asylum seekers in 1995 and became a U.S. citizen in 2000. He criticized Omar for speaking on the U.S. Constitution when she comes from a country that is a “disaster,” he said, while saying Somalia is known for “pirates.”
Hundreds of protesters, who gathered at the intersection outside the Trump rally at the Horizon Events Center, held signs criticizing the administration and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The weekend before Trump’s visit, Border Patrol agents fatally shot Alex Petti, a 37-year-old nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center, during protests against immigration enforcement officers’ ongoing presence in state. While Trump and administration officials have said the shooting was justified and linked the death with Pretti having a gun, multiple witnesses’ videos showing the incident do not indicate Pretti was brandishing or threatening agents with the weapon. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Pretti was a lawful gun owner who had a concealed carry permit and no criminal record.
Trump met with Iowans before the rally at the popular restaurant The Machine Shed, where he was greeted with applause and joined by U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, who is running for reelection in Iowa’s 3rd District. The president also took questions from reporters while at the eatery about the Pretti’s death in Minnesota, Venezuela and the price of gasoline.
When asked if Trump would pull all immigration and border patrol agents out of the Twin Cities, Trump replied, “We’ll do whatever’s appropriate,” according to reporters traveling with the president.
In response to a question about why he sent border czar Tom Homan into Minnesota to address immigration operations on the ground, Trump said, “I do that all the time. I shake up teams.”
“Everybody here, these are a lot of owners of farmers and places, and you shake up your team, if they can’t do the crops fast enough. Look, we have an incredible team. We did something that nobody said was possible. We didn’t go back to Congress ask for legislation – we closed the border,” Trump said.
Earlier in January, ICE agents shot and killed Renee Good. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and officials Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension have said federal officials have impeded state attempts to conduct investigations of the shootings and mishandled evidence.
On Monday, Walz’s office stated that Trump spoke with the governor and plans to speak with U.S. Department of Homeland Security about allowing independent BCA investigations of the incidents, as well as looking into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota.
In Washington, another partial government shutdown looms as Senate Democrats say the Homeland Security funding bill must include constraints on federal immigration enforcement following the Minnesota shootings. Many Democrats in Congress have also signed onto an impeachment resolution for U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem following the escalated violence.
However, before departing for Iowa, Trump told reporters Noem is not stepping down, and said she is doing a “very good job.”
Trump says year-round E-15 approval working through Congress
Trump said “I promise to support E-15 all year round” — a pledge he made on the presidential campaign trail to allow the nationwide, year-round sale of 15% ethanol ratio blend of fuel. He said he was in discussions to put out a statement on E-15 last week.
“I said, hold it — I’m coming to Iowa to make a speech, I’m not going to put out a (Truth Social),” Trump said. “… I want to be there in person to tell them.
He said he is “trusting” House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to find a deal with farmers, consumers and refineries in order to advance year-round E-15, and “they’re very close to getting it done.”
“And Johnny will be sending me a bill very shortly supporting year-round E-15 to buy gas very quickly, and I will sign it within a week,” Trump said. “I hope you remember us for the midterms.”

Three members of Iowa’s all-Republican congressional delegation, U.S. Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson and Nunn, gave speeches ahead of Trump at the event, praising the Trump administration’s policies and calling for support to keep the state red in the 2026 elections. U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, running for Iowa governor in 2026, was also in attendance.
Nunn said Iowa is “helping lead the charge to be energy independent, so that Russia or Iran or Venezuela doesn’t get to dictate what happens in Iowa.” He said while speaking with Trump about gas prices, Trump told him gas was under $2.50 a gallon in many parts of the country.
“I said, ‘Drive to Casey’s, Mr. President, we get to you for a buck eight-five,'” Nunn said. “… Whether you are filling up a truck or a tractor, a minivan for a motor home, here’s the reality: Iowa biofuels will help drive down that cost.”
Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, a Democrat who is running for U.S. Senate in 2026, said in a news conference organized by Defend America Action the Trump administration’s inaction on E-15 fuel “is causing so much frustration and anger among Iowa corn growers,” and that tariff policies have caused already input costs for farmers to increase further.
Wahls said Trump has shown he cares more about “bailing out Argentina” and supporting U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s financial backers than he cares about Iowa farmers.
“That’s why there was so much anger that is out there in smalltown rural Iowa, and it’s clear the president’s coming to Iowa today trying to do damage control, trying to put lipstick on a pig,” Wahls said. “But it’s his pig, and Iowa farmers aren’t happy about it.”
Trump touts ‘affordability’ measures through tax policies
In addition to supporting Iowa farmers, Trump said measures like eliminating federal taxes on Social Security and tipped income included in the spending bill he signed in July will help Iowa businesses and families. He said the American economy is improving under his policies even though “we inherited such a horrible situation with all of the high prices and inflation and everything” under former President Joe Biden.
But Iowa Democrats said Trump’s speech comes amid worsening economic prospects for Iowans. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said the cost of living is rising for people across the state amid growing layoffs.
“It’s laughable that Trump is coming here today to talk about affordability of all things, when Iowans are literally paying more because of his disastrous policies,” Hart said at a news conference before Tuesday’s rally.
Democrats and advocates also said Trump’s and Republicans’ policies have made health care more expensive, pointing both to the lapsed Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits and the cuts to Medicaid made in the federal spending bill signed this summer — which some health care advocates say will cause rural hospitals to close.
The measure included $50 billion between 2026 and 2030 for the Rural Health Transformation Program to offset some these losses, and Iowa was awarded $209 million for the first year of its rural health care improvement plan, “Healthy Hometowns.” But Jessica Schubel, former special assistant to Biden for health care, said this funding is not enough to make up for the $290 million a year rural Iowa hospitals are expected to see due to the Medicaid cuts.
“Republicans are not serious about making life easier for Iowans to afford health insurance on top of your higher grocery bills, rent and electricity costs, let alone to do or have more of the fun things in life,” Schubel said. “But they are serious about helping rich people get richer. Iowans deserve better, they deserve more.”
Trump said he would address health care costs by making changes to the Affordable Care Act, saying his proposal would distribute money directly to patients.
“Obamacare was created to make insurance companies rich with government subsidies,” Trump said. “I want all that money that gets paid to the insurance companies, to get paid directly to the people. … The problem is the Democrats don’t want to do that because they are owned by the insurance companies.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Rep. Chrissy Houlahan announced she’s supporting the effort to remove Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
She now joins all six other Pennsylvania Democrats in the U.S. House who had already signed on as co-sponsors of impeachment articles.
The articles were filed earlier this month by Illinois Rep. Robin Kelly, whose district includes parts of Chicago. The city dealt with heavy Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol activity last year, including the deployment of a Blackhawk helicopter in a heavily criticized apartment complex raid.
Democratic support for impeaching Noem has gained momentum since the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis Saturday by federal agents. Earlier Tuesday, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said the caucus will move forward with impeachment unless Noem resigns or is fired by President Donald Trump.
Democrats do not have the majority necessary to initiate impeachment proceedings without Republican support. The GOP holds a five-seat advantage. The effort would need a two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict.
Here’s the list of US House Democrats who want to impeach Kristi Noem

Noem has come under heavy criticism as the head of the agency responsible for immigration enforcement. Last year, ICE detained more than 170 American citizens, killed five people in shootings, and had 32 people die in their custody. Lawsuits have also been filed over ICE’s aggressive deployment of crowd control methods, like the use of tear gas and physical force, against protesters and journalists. Immigration agents have also been photographed pointing firearms at protesters.
Noem was also quick to characterize two citizens killed by federal agents in Minnesota, Pretti and Renee Good, as “domestic terrorist[s]” engaging in violence against officers. She made similar comments within hours after each respective shooting, before any investigations were completed, despite widely-circulated videos appearing to contradict her claims.

Trump reportedly met with Noem and her senior advisor, Corey Lewandowski, for two hours on Monday evening as backlash grew against ICE tactics in Minneapolis and DHS’ characterization of shooting victims as domestic terrorists. According to a CNN report, neither Noem’s nor Lewandowski’s jobs were threatened.
The meeting followed the demotion of Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino. He had become the face of some of the agency’s most aggressive crackdowns in Democrat-led cities across the country, like “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago and “Operation Metro Surge” in Minneapolis.
Noem is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March.

As it stands, Pennsylvania’s 10 Republican U.S. House members have been generally supportive of the Trump administration’s deployment of federal immigration agents in American cities far from the border. But, support has been fraying since the back-to-back shootings in Minneapolis.
Speaking on Newsmax Tuesday, Rep. Dan Meuser (R-09) said, “We’ve had some tragic situations that occurred out in Minneapolis.” But, he also claimed the blame should be on “the fact that Biden let in 20 million illegals” and local Democratic leaders who he says “demonized ICE.”
Several others have grown more cautiously critical.
Shortly before the shooting, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-01) told the New York Times he’d like ICE to show “more compassion and empathy in enforcement.” On Tuesday, he co-authored a bipartisan letter to Trump calling for comprehensive immigration reform, including offering “legal protection to millions of immigrants.”
Reps. Ryan Mackenzie (R-07) and Lloyd Smucker (R-11) have called for investigations into Saturday’s shooting. 
In the U.S. Senate, Pennsylvania Democrat John Fetterman has added himself to the growing chorus calling for Noem’s removal.

“President Trump: I make a direct appeal to immediately fire Secretary Noem,” he said in a statement issued Tuesday. “Americans have died. She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy. DO NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary.”
It’s a reversal for Fetterman, who voted to confirm Noem to her position last January and has been one of the staunchest Democratic supporters of the administration’s immigration agenda. He has, however, broken with his party’s calls to block funding for DHS. The move would risk a partial government shutdown, an outcome Fetterman said he wants to avoid.
A spokesperson for Fetterman did not immediately respond to a question about whether he would support Noem’s impeachment.
Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Dave McCormick has also joined a number of moderate Republicans in calling for an investigation into the shooting of Pretti.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/kristinoemmay82025-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 19:57:00.310175

(Courtesy of Center for Public Affairs Research, University of Nebraska at Omaha)LINCOLN — While Nebraska’s overall population increased slightly to an estimated 2,018,008 in the latest Census report, the key component driving state growth in past years plummeted: immigration.
Data released Tuesday reveals a 0.6% annual population bump, or about 12,500 more residents overall from July 2024 through June 2025. The information also shows the three main components of population change.

Of the three, international migration was most glaring. More foreign-born newcomers still came to Nebraska than left, but the net growth of 6,599 was half the amount reported the previous year.
Josie Schafer of the Center for Public Affairs Research at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, the state’s liaison to the Census Bureau, attributes the reversal to federal immigration policies versus any shift in how the data is tracked. 
A drop in net international migration is reflected nationally as well, with the Census Bureau’s Vintage 2025 estimates showing a “historic decline,” from 2.7 million in 2024 to 1.3 million in 2025. The drop, the bureau said, was caused by both a decrease in immigration and an increase in emigration (people moving out or being moved out of the U.S.).
A continued pattern in Nebraska would not bode well for population expansion, Schafer said.
“If international migration has been our main source of growth and now, at a policy level, we can expect that to be less, that is going to be a challenge to growth,” she said.
Tuesday’s Census release shows Nebraska’s “natural change” remained positive — with 6,136 more Husker births than deaths. That net gain was essentially unchanged from the previous year.
“Those numbers are nice,” said Schafer.
‘Brain drain’ alarm escalates: Omaha and business leaders flag job lag

Notable, she said, is Nebraska’s improvement in domestic migration. To be sure, more people continue to flee than move to Nebraska. But the gap lessened between 2024 and 2025, going from a net loss of 1,498 people to a net loss of 366. For perspective, Nebraska lost about 6,000 more people than it gained in 2021.
“We’ve kind of turned a corner on that domestic migration trend,” said Schafer. 
That component, however, does not shed necessary light on the persistent problem of Nebraska “brain drain,” she said. It reflects overall domestic migration and does not hone in on age or education levels.
More detailed demographic and countywide Census data is to come later. Schafer said Tuesday’s Vintage 2025 population release are administrative estimates.
Dana Bradford is a leader of the Aksarben Foundation, a business group that has raised alarms about Nebraska falling behind its peers in quality job, wage and economic growth. He finds little reason to rejoice in Nebraska’s 0.6% annual population increase and would like to see a 1.25% boost to start seeing growth in the state’s educated workforce.

That more people still leave for other states than come to Nebraska is a concern, he said, calling it a sign of better job and career opportunities elsewhere. Aksarben’s focus is on luring high-paying jobs. They argue to do that first and that the qualified workforce would follow.
“Our skilled workforce is in decline,” said Bradford.
Schafer’s examination of the new Census release shows Nebraska ranking 18th among states in overall population growth. She said a handful of states surpassed 1% growth.
In a similar update a year ago, the Census estimated Nebraska hit an overall population of 2,005,465, a one-year addition of 17,601 Huskers. At an annual growth of 0.88%, Nebraska then ranked as the 17th fastest-growing state.
The Aksarben Foundation is among other groups in Nebraska that have  commissioned studying the employment and business landscape. Aksarben has formed a nonprofit “Strengthening Nebraska Families” to educate and stir action to elevate the state’s competitiveness.  
Other states are “taking our workforce away from us,” said Bradford, CEO of C3 Brands and former chair of Greater Omaha Chamber, citing the various reports.
“We’re in a battle for people,” he said. “We’ve got to win that battle.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A Utah lawmaker wants to provide extra cash to police departments to help them solve violent crimes. 
Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, told reporters Tuesday the goal is to help police departments improve their clearance rates, or the share of cases they determine are closed. 
“This is really just smart investment in reducing crime,” Clancy said. 
Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, speaks at a news conference about his bill proposing a new grant program for local police on Jan. 27, 2026. (Jackson Murphy, Utah House of Representatives)
His bill, HB137, would create a new grant program for law enforcement agencies, with a portion of the funding set aside just for rural departments. They could use the money for several purposes, including hiring homicide detectives, holding trainings and running forensic analysis. 
Clancy, also a detective with Provo police, is asking lawmakers to set aside $250,000 this year for the initiative but said he also envisions private donors chipping in. The state’s more than $30 billion budget is expected to be tight due to federal tax cuts.
Clearance rates help measure how many reports of crime are solved, but not every “cleared” case results in criminal charges for a perpetrator. 
Some cases are cleared by arrest. Others are cleared by “exceptional” means, when police know who and where their suspect is and believe they have enough evidence, but can’t make an arrest because of factors outside their control. Examples include that a suspect died or prosecutors decided not to file criminal charges. 
Law enforcement agencies including Baltimore police in Maryland have faced accusations of improperly clearing cases by exception — including by blaming crimes on people who are deceased — to artificially inflate their clearance rates. 
Utah’s overall clearance rate in the last five years is about 70%, above the national rate of roughly 56%, according to FBI data. When it comes to rape, about 1 in 3 Utah cases are cleared, which is also higher than the national rate. 
Survivors of sexual assault have criticized law enforcement in Utah and beyond, saying it’s not just a matter of resources but of detectives’ willingness to thoroughly investigate their cases.

Proponents of the Utah bill say it could provide meaningful help. 
Ogden Police Chief Jake Sube said during a news conference Tuesday that a single homicide or violent assault can take hundreds of hours to investigate, and the bill provides “targeted support.” 
“This is especially important for agencies with limited operational resources, including small and rural communities,” Sube said. 
Clancy noted Utah isn’t alone in considering a bill seeking to strengthen police investigative capabilities and improve clearance rates.
“This is an issue that’s gaining steam, I think, with both Republicans and Democrats across the country,” Clancy said. 
One of his Democratic colleagues, Rep. Verona Mauga, of Salt Lake City, spoke in favor of the bill during the news conference at the state Capitol. 
Reps. Tyler Clancy and Verona Mauga are pictured with Ogden Police Chief Jake Sube at the Utah Capitol on Jan. 27, 2026. (Jackson Murphy, Utah House of Representatives)
“Too many people are still waiting for answers in cases that have gone cold,” Mauga said. “That kind of uncertainty is incredibly painful.” 
A similar measure in Michigan faced pushback last month and questions about how much it would help, after clearance rates there fell despite past boosts in public investment. 
Both the Utah and Michigan proposals have support from the Niskanen Center, a Washington D.C.-based think tank which contends they could deter future instances of violent crime and keep communities safer. 
The Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice would run the grant program and  measure improvement at police departments receiving the grants. The bill doesn’t stipulate exactly how big financial awards would be or how many police departments could qualify.  
The bill has not yet been scheduled for a public hearing.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington spent roughly $500 million last year in settlements and jury verdicts in cases involving government misconduct.
The skyrocketing lawsuit payouts are hamstringing state and local government budgets.
Lawmakers pitched one way of dealing with the issue Tuesday. They want to make these civil claims subject to arbitration to reduce costs. For one, legal fees often stack up in these cases, which can end with jury verdicts that reach tens of millions of dollars in damages. 
Legislators also face a budget question, as the state agency that handles these payments is asking for hundreds of millions of dollars to address the rising costs. Legislators punted on dealing with the budget concerns last year.
“What has been happening to the budgets of our school districts, our cities, our counties and the state are untenable,” said state Sen. Manka Dhingra, D-Redmond, lead sponsor of the bill requiring arbitration. “We are simply at the point in time that we cannot continue to do fiscal management and responsibility without addressing tort liability.”
Dhingra’s bill, if passed into law, won’t be a silver bullet. It’s unclear how much money it would save, but it likely wouldn’t make a huge dent in the surging payouts.
Lawyers who bring these claims are opposed to the bill. They say the state doesn’t have the infrastructure to support arbitration in all these cases and that it would be an obstacle to justice for people harmed by the government.
The state is self-insured, meaning the legal payouts come from agency funding that would otherwise go toward services. Legislation and court rulings have expanded liability in recent years, exposing the state to more lawsuits.
Payments have continued apace after last year’s record. In the first half of the current fiscal year, which began July 1, the state paid nearly $237 million, according to the Department of Enterprise Services. 
The costs represent accountability for the state as it grapples with decades of alleged misconduct, from wrongful terminations to deaths in prison and mishandled child welfare cases. The deluge of lawsuits in recent years shows no signs of slowing down.
The state has also paid roughly $36 million in legal expenses, $13 million of which is going to the state attorney general’s office, which represents state agencies. The rest is going to outside firms that provided contracted legal services to the state.
Lawyers representing people who sue the government can also collect court-ordered legal fees when the state loses a case.
Last year, the state Department of Enterprise Services warned that without a more permanent fix to funding the state’s self-insurance fund, its deficit could grow to more than $1.3 billion by mid-2027. By mid-2029, the gap could be anywhere from $2 billion to $3.2 billion. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson’s budget plan, released last month, puts $955 million toward addressing the problem. He said last month that on any shortlist of budget challenges the state is facing, tort liability would be there.
The legislation
Senate Bill 6239 looks to deal with the growing liability through civil arbitration for tort claims against the state and local government entities. 
This means a neutral third-party could make a decision on how much plaintiffs win in their cases outside of court. The cases could still go to a traditional jury trial. 
The legislation wouldn’t limit monetary damages or attorney fees that could be ordered, but would provide an option to resolve cases early, said Dhingra, who chairs the Senate Law and Justice Committee. The two sides would likely split the cost of the arbitration. 
The bill is scheduled for a committee vote Thursday. If passed by the Senate and House and signed by Ferguson, it would take effect immediately.
Currently, arbitration is required in civil lawsuits in county superior courts claiming less than $15,000 in damages, or if a judge approves, up to $100,000. Under the measure, all claims against governments would be subject to arbitration.
The issue looms over not just the state but its local governments, which are similarly dealing with rising liability. 
Cities, counties and school districts are in lockstep in support of the legislation. Pierce County has received 140 claims seeking a total of over $320 million related to alleged abuse in the 20th century at the county’s juvenile detention center, County Executive Ryan Mello told lawmakers on Tuesday. So far, the county has paid out more than $9 million.

The size of the claims threatens to undermine the county’s funding for core services like elections and criminal justice, Mello said. 
On the other side of the debate, Gabriel Galanda, an influential Indigenous rights attorney in Seattle, called the arbitration bill an “assault on civil rights protection.”
“State juries do justice,” Galanda told senators. “State juries bring daylight to situations the government tries to hide from daylight.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Constitutional concerns helped tank a bill Tuesday in the South Dakota House of Representatives that aimed to ban payments to petition circulators in ballot measure campaigns.
Rep. Travis Ismay, R-Newell, sponsored House Bill 1087. It sought to bar payments for those who want to put initiated laws, referendums or constitutional amendments on the ballot. 
Ismay argued that paying circulators undermines the interests of South Dakotans by allowing out-of-state interests to fund campaigns meant to change the state.
Paying ballot-question petition circulators would be banned by bill advancing to SD House

Circulators need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to propose a law or challenge a bill passed by the Legislature. They need 35,017 to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot.
Ismay’s bill would allow a court to invalidate a petition if its circulators were found to have been paid.
Rep. Mark Roby, R-Watertown, said South Dakota would be sued over HB 1087 and lose. He pointed to Supreme Court cases that took up the legality of payments for petition circulation and ruled it to be protected First Amendment speech.
Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, said passing a bill bound to cost taxpayers an untold amount of money for a losing cause is bad policy.
“That’s just fiscally irresponsible use of our state taxpayer dollars,” Muckey said.
Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, who was among the members who stood up to back Ismay’s bill, said the fight to defend the bill in court would be worth it.
“Sometimes lawsuits like that are essential to preserve our democracy,” said Hughes, who described every interaction he’s had with paid circulators as “miserable.”
“I could tell they were not from around here, and they were there to harvest signatures,” Hughes said.

It is one of five major companies, each needing training for thousands of employees, in the state as South Carolina seeks to become a hub for electric vehicles and batteries. (Provided by Scout Motors)COLUMBIA — South Carolina has racked up $150 million in cost overruns as it works to fulfill pledges it made to lure electric vehicle maker Scout Motors to the state. The state’s economic development agency wants taxpayers to make up the difference.
South Carolina lawmakers, in March 2023, already agreed to spend $1.3 billion to bring Scout to the Palmetto State. If the General Assembly does not agree to pony up the additional cash in the next state budget, the state Commerce Department would have to tell contractors working on the site that it doesn’t have the money to pay them.
“And we would not have the money to pay them for several years under our regular funding,” Harry Lightsey, South Carolina’s economic development chief, told legislators Tuesday.
Funneling future money from its standing annual budget allocations also means Commerce would have to pass on other companies that may come seeking to build in the state, he said.
The costs
More than half of the over-budget expenses are related to an environmental package meant to offset the wetlands lost when the Volkswagen subsidiary started to build, Lightsey told a House budget-writing panel.
In the agreement with Scout, the state Department of Commerce and Richland County agreed to contract and pay for all of the mass grading work at no cost to the company. And the costs of all associated environmental requirements were to be borne solely by the state and county, the 192-page contract reads.
At the heart of the issue are tight deadlines Scout Motors set for getting this work done so it could begin assembling vehicles in 2027. Those due dates were redacted in the copy of the agreement Commerce provided to the SC Daily Gazette.
“Scout wanted to build this plant and have it in production on an extremely aggressive schedule,” Lightsey said. “So, there was certainly a lot of time pressure involved in all of this.”
That meant Commerce needed a waiver from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to avoid a more lengthy, two-year environmental permitting process.
“If we had had to go through a two-year process, that would have killed the project,” Lightsey said.
The company, through a permit filed by Commerce and the county on its behalf, first offered to protect 4,902 acres of wetlands near Congaree National Park and another 155 acres on the Broad River, known as Shelton Island.
To win the Corp’ approval, the group added 18 miles of stream restoration in Sumter National Forest to its environmental proposal, along with more improvements to land along the Congaree River.
While the group waited for a nod from the Corps, crews had to pause work for five months, racking up an even greater bill. Equipment the state had rented sat idle.
“We wanted to be ready to go to work as soon as we received the wetlands permit. And we were concerned that if we let go of that equipment, that would take additional time and effort to get that equipment back on the site,” Lightsey said.

Once the Corps allowed the state to resume work, Commerce spent an additional $18 million to bring more crews on site and get its construction schedule back on track after the months-long environmental delay and an unusually rainy 2024, Lightsey said.
Also related to the rain, the state Department of Environmental Services required Commerce to build dams on site to hold back rainwater and keep clay and silt from washing onto downstream neighbors’ property. The cost: $17 million.
Beyond the environmental issues, a third of the overruns were related to road improvements the state and county agreed to make on Scout’s behalf.
Scout also ups investment
In his own budget proposal, Gov. Henry McMaster only recommended giving Commerce a third of the money it’s requesting. Commerce officials did not say how the agency would make up the remainder if the Legislature adopts the governor’s suggestion.
Scout Motors did not approach Commerce or the governor about making the budget ask, according to company spokesman Jamie Lovegrove.
In a statement, the company said it “appreciates the State of South Carolina’s continued commitment to completing the earthwork and site preparation in support of our project.”
Scout also pointed out that its own expenses have ballooned. And it is building out a business park to house potential suppliers without requesting any additional incentives from the state.
That brings the company’s total investment to $3 billion — a $1 billion increase over our initial announcement.
Meanwhile, more than 130,000 people have signed up to buy the first Scout vehicles when they roll off the line next year.
Of those pre-orders, 80% of buyers are asking for the hybrid-like models the carmaker announced in October 2024 that it would offer.
These models, which Scout is calling Harvesters, have both a battery and a gas engine that can recharge the battery while the car is still in motion, extending the range of travel to 500 miles between refueling.
Commerce officials said they were unable to respond by deadline to questions from the SC Daily Gazette about whether it had approached Scout Motors about amending the agreement and covering the shortfall.
The agency also did not say whether it would change how it writes these types of agreements in the future by committing to a set dollar amount rather than being left on the hook when something goes over budget.
“Sure, you’re not happy about the overrun. We’re not happy about it,” said Rep. Leon Stavrinakis, D-Charleston.
“But if you knew 2 ½ years ago that it would cost an extra $150 million, would you still have recommended this project to the governor and to the General Assembly?” asked the chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee.
“Absolutely,” Lightsey replied.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Scout-Groundbreaking-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 19:57:00.310175

Age-specific housing improves health outcomes and reduces costs.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kim Fitzgerald: Healthy aging starts with housing.","This commentary is by Kim Fitzgerald, chief executive officer of Cathedral Square, a Vermont nonprofit affordable housing organization.



Vermont has one of the oldest populations in the nation, a severe housing shortage, and rising health care costs. As the legislative session begins, new research offers evidence about an investment that addresses these realities: age-specific, affordable housing with supportive services for adults 55 and older.
A recent study from NORC at the University of Chicago, a nonpartisan research organization, spent two years tracking older adults who moved into age-specific housing communities.

Rather than experiencing the decline many assume comes with such life transitions, residents showed significant improvements in health, longevity and quality of life.
Many people find these results surprising, but I don’t. At Cathedral Square, we’ve witnessed these transformations firsthand for nearly 50 years. 
Today, we provide homes and services to over 1,300 people in 28 communities across Vermont. We’ve seen people arrive thinking they’re nearing the end of their lives, only to become healthier, happier and more active once they settle in. We have residents who have lived with us for more than 40 years.
The report’s findings challenge a persistent misconception that moving later in life is inherently harmful. What we’ve learned is the opposite. 
When older Vermonters move into housing designed for their needs, with services that support independence, they thrive. They connect with neighbors. They belong to a community. 
They access health care before small problems become emergencies. They remain independent longer than they would have otherwise.  
A key part of this success is coordinated health care. In 2009, Cathedral Square partnered with other housing and services organizations to create Support and Services at Home (SASH), which has been available statewide to Medicare recipients free of charge since 2011. 
SASH celebrates its 15th anniversary this year, and it exemplifies what the research confirms: when health care coordination is built into housing, outcomes improve dramatically, and the growth in health care costs decreases in a significant way.
This matters now because Vermont faces converging challenges. We have more Vermonters aging into their 70s and 80s each year.
We have a housing affordability crisis that hits people on fixed incomes especially hard. 
And we have health care costs that spiral when people can’t access preventive care or fall through gaps in coordination.  
SASH addresses these challenges head-on. Care coordination prevents health problems from becoming crises. People stay connected to their communities and support systems. And no one has to choose between paying rent and buying food and medications.
Here’s something people don’t always consider: when older adults move into affordable housing designed for their current and future needs, they free up housing in the community for individuals and families. 
Creating more age-specific housing helps address Vermont’s broader housing shortage. That’s why sustained funding for the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board (VHCB) is critical. It’s the primary source of state funding for perpetually affordable housing of all kinds across Vermont.
The economic case is clear. Every dollar invested in affordable housing with coordinated care and support services returns dividends through reduced emergency room visits, avoided hospitalizations and longer independent living. 
We have nearly 1,400 people on the waiting list for Cathedral Square apartments. The demand is real. The need is urgent.
As legislators consider appropriations for housing and health care, they should recognize that these aren’t separate line items. 
For older Vermonters, especially, housing is health care. Stable, appropriate housing with coordinated services keeps people healthier for longer at lower cost to the health care system. SASH has proven this works.
The question isn’t whether we can afford to invest in VHCB and programs like SASH. With Vermont’s rapidly aging population, the question is whether we can afford not to.

This story by Sophia Balunek was first published in The Other Paper on Jan. 22, 2026.j
28% of students this year in the South Burlington School District qualify for free or reduced lunch, which means they are living at or below the poverty line, according to data presented at a November school board meeting.
As Vermonters faced new levels of food insecurity when Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, or 3SquaresVT, were threatened in October, several families in the district reported they did not have transportation to the South Burlington Food Shelf, and some immigrant families said they didn’t feel safe going to a food shelf, according to Monica Desrochers, the high school’s director of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Anti-Racism, and Social Emotional Learning who gathered the data.
She brought this information to senior Ally Leduc, one of two student representatives on the school board, who took the initiative to start an in-house food pantry in the high school along with senior Katie Williamson.
“I think a lot of people walk around the school not really aware of our poverty rate and how many students are actually living in poverty,” Leduc said.
Now, located in one of the front administrative offices is a table full of shelf-stable foods like soup, pasta, tuna and peanut butter, along with a pile of mid-sized backpacks. The room is unlocked and open.
In order to mobilize quickly so students could take home food for winter break, Leduc and Williamson collaborated with multiple clubs to gather a food drive, including the Student Justice Union, Student Council, Key Club, Student Ambassadors Program and community service.
“It’s cool to have so many different leaders within the school that usually are kind of disconnected, doing their own thing, all coming together for one cause,” Leduc said.
Students who are food insecure are invited to fill the backpacks with food and bring it home, returning the bag later. The organizers say it’s common for students to carry around multiple backpacks, which ensures a level of anonymity.
Having to access an area with a designated staff keyholder could be a big barrier for some students, Leduc said.
“For someone to be like, ‘Hey, my family is food insecure,’ that could feel uncomfortable to have that conversation unless it’s a trusted adult,” she said. “So, they can come in on their own.”
The placement of the room in this part of the school is purposeful, as opposed to next to the library where the care closet is, for example.
“It looks more discreet if you want to come in and grab food and you don’t really want anyone to notice,” Williamson said.
The school has run food drives before, but this is its first in-house food pantry, and organizers are working to flesh out details on how to make it known to students that they can access this resource, while ensuring it’s used respectfully.
“What our spring work is,” Desrochers said, “is helping students understand what is the difference between, like, me being hungry during the day and just wanting a snack because I want some Goldfish and I don’t want actual lunch, versus me being food insecure.”
Leduc and Williamson said they have a lot of trust in their peers to understand the food shelf’s purpose, and they think students would “recognize the boundaries around it.”
With Williamson as president of the Key Club — a community service group that works in the surrounding neighborhood and has organized many food drives — and Leduc on the school board, they were able to push their idea through the administrative approval process quickly, and they said it’s been well received and supported.
Their peers have confidence in them as student leaders, too.
“We’ve made it known with the student body that we’re trustworthy people, and if that’s a thing they feel uncomfortable with, there’s confidentiality,” Leduc said.
Desrochers said the initiative is student-driven, with two other student ambassadors — Ella Stein and Naba’a Hussein — helping Leduc and Williamson kickstart the project.
“I don’t take any credit for this. This is all them,” Desrochers said.

As frigid temperatures persist, supplies dwindle and roads remain impassable, tens of thousands of Mississippians remain without power. For some, there is no clear end in sight. 
Heather Hurt of Corinth had been without power for almost 60 hours on Tuesday afternoon. To keep herself and four children between the ages of 5 and 14 warm, she has been using a generator to run one space heater and three heated blankets. The family has been huddling in a bedroom to stay warm since Sunday in their home. 
Monday night, for dinner and to entertain the kids, the family taste-tested an array of ready-to-eat meals and cooked Polish sausages over Hanukkah candles Hurt found in the cupboard. Tuesday, they were using a terracotta pot and candles to fashion a makeshift stove to boil water for ramen.

The family cannot leave the house because the roads in their neighborhood are impassable without four-wheel drive, Hurt said. She grew up in Indiana and is used to wintery weather, but said the conditions now in the northeastern corner of Mississippi — ice-covered roads, snapped trees and fallen power lines — are much worse. 
“This is a whole different ballpark,” Hurt said. 
Winter Storm Fern has caused subfreezing temperatures, icy roads and power outages across Mississippi. 
Ten people were injured Tuesday when a canopy collapsed above gas pumps in Greenville, bringing the total injured in the state as a result of the severe weather to 13, Gov. Tate Reeves said. Four deaths had been reported in Mississippi as of Tuesday, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. 
The state has the highest proportion of customers in the country —about 9% — still without power, according to poweroutage.us. As of Tuesday evening, more than 128,000 homes and businesses were without power. 
Among the hardest hit are customers of the Tippah Electric Power Association, which serves Alcorn, Benton, Tippah and Union counties in northeast Mississippi. The utility company had the highest percentage of customers without power in the state on Tuesday – about 90% – according to poweroutage.us. On Monday, Tippah EPA said restoring electricity to customers could take weeks.
Eight substations powered by the Tennessee Valley Authority in northern Mississippi had no power flowing to them, according to a Tuesday statement from Electric Cooperatives of Mississippi, a nonprofit that represents Tippah EPA and other member utility companies. 
TVA is working diligently to restore power and hoped to have electricity provided to the substations “some time on Tuesday,” according to the cooperative organization.
“To be clear, electric energy provided to the substation does not mean that members will receive power immediately,” TVA said.
Dangerous roads, low temperatures, and failing limbs are also impacting crews’ ability to restore power to northern Mississippi and the Delta.
President Donald Trump approved an emergency declaration for Mississippi on Saturday, and Reeves deployed the Mississippi National Guard Monday to help with logistics and getting emergency supplies to parts of the state hit hardest by the storm. The Mississippi National Guard is delivering commodities by aircraft to Alcorn County Tuesday, Reeves said in a statement. 
The federal emergency declaration authorizes FEMA to support Mississippi’s state-led emergency response. 
FEMA is working to assess impacts throughout the state, and the federal agency has brought in trailerloads of meals, water, tarps, blankets, cots and 60 generators, as well as personnel to install them, Rob Ashe, acting regional administrator for FEMA Region 4, told Mississippi Today on Tuesday.

Ashe said he has also deployed six division supervisors, who will be placed in the most heavily impacted counties, to support local emergency managers. 
The large swath of states impacted, in addition to Mississippi, make this natural disaster unique, Ashe said. 
“The scale of this is different,” he said. 
Victoria Lavanway of Saltillo lost power Sunday and regained it Monday morning. But road conditions made it impossible for her and her husband to go see her mother-in-law, who lives near Memphis and was battling cancer, before she died Sunday.  
“It’s just been a lot, you know,” Lavanway said to Mississippi Today.
Lavanway’s parents, who are in their late 50s and live in Slayden, near the state’s northern border, have been out of power and water since Sunday. Their limited supply of gasoline for a generator was running out. 
Her parents have spent two days bundled up on the front porch in the sun to conserve energy so they can use their generator at night. The high temperature was 36 degrees Tuesday. 
Another daughter with running power lives 15 minutes away from them, in Byhalia, but the couple cannot travel the short distance to her because ice and snow covering the roads, along with highways backed up with 18-wheelers, have made the path unnavigable, Lavanway said. 
“It’s like pure devastation,” she said. 
The Mississippi Department of Transportation strongly advised people to travel for emergency reasons only. Densely packed ice and freezing temperatures are making it difficult to plow in northern parts of the state, the agency said Tuesday. 
“We ask the traveling public to remain patient while we recover from this devastating storm,” said MDOT Executive Director Brad White. “Please give our crews space to clear roadways safely.”
More than 90 homes, three businesses and seven farms have reported damage, though the numbers are expected to rise as assessments continue.

Pastor Levi Burcham of Gospel Tabernacle in Corinth said roughly 100 people were staying at the church Tuesday. He said the number of people at the warming shelter, which is run by A Place of Grace, has grown as days have gone by, as most of the county is without power and water. 
All types of people have congregated at the church for warmth and shelter, Burcham said. 
“I’m in the same boat at my house, no heat outside of a generator, no running water,” he said. 
As a paramedic firefighter, Hurt caught her first glimpse of the coming devastation as she worked a shift Saturday night into Sunday morning. She said she expects the damage to be much greater than is currently known, given the widespread power outages, limited water supplies in some areas and obstructed roads.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — A measure that would ask South Dakota voters to restrict eminent domain in a state constitutional amendment is moving on to be heard by the state Senate.
It passed the House on a 62-5 vote Tuesday.
Eminent domain is the power to take private property for public use, with just compensation to the owner. It’s been a divisive issue in South Dakota the last several years because of a proposed multi-state carbon capture pipeline that would pass through the eastern part of the state.
The legislation asks voters to approve a constitutional amendment clarifying that eminent domain “may not be exercised for the purpose of transferring private property to a non-governmental entity solely to promote economic development or increase tax revenue without the provision of a public use.”
Eminent domain ban advances from Iowa Senate subcommittee but changes are planned

Rep. Spencer Gosch, R-Glenham, introduced the bill, which passed through the House State Affairs Committee last week. He said the measure would not ban eminent domain completely.
“We are helping property owners in the state of South Dakota maintain their rights on their property by saying, ‘No, you cannot take my property for economic development or increased tax revenue purposes,’” Gosch said Tuesday. “If I wanted to bring a bill to get rid of eminent domain, I would have done that.”
Supporters of the measure say the amendment would strengthen a law passed last year, which specifically bans eminent domain for carbon capture pipeline projects.
Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, worried that the language of the bill is too vague. He said the “poorly drafted” bill is a “poison pill,” because it could unintentionally enshrine a right to eminent domain for economic development or increased tax revenue as long as a public use can be shown.
Down the line, Hughes said, private entities could use things like combating climate change to justify a public use for a carbon pipeline. The proposed pipeline project from Summit Carbon Solutions would capture carbon dioxide emissions from ethanol plants in five states and bury them in North Dakota, to capitalize on federal tax credits incentivizing the prevention of heat-trapping emissions into the atmosphere.
“To now enshrine the ability to take private property for purposes of economic development or increasing tax revenue, so long as that you have a public use, wow, I can’t go there,” Hughes said.
He also criticized the phrase “economic development” in the legislation.
“I don’t even know what that means,” he said. “I support economic growth. I don’t know what economic development is.”
Open-ended language leaves the state vulnerable to lawsuits, he said.
If the Senate also approves the measure, it will go to voters in the Nov. 3 general election.

Jeremy Cannon of Turbeville becomes the second Republican looking to replace Commissioner Hugh Weathers, who’s retiring after nearly 22 years leading the state Department of Agriculture. Last year, he endorsed a director in the agency, Fred West of Batesburg-Leesville, to succeed him.
West, who launched his bid last January, had been the lone person vying the $162,000 job, until Cannon announced his run on Facebook earlier this month. It’s the first-ever campaign for both candidates.

The job entails overseeing about 250 full-time employees with duties that include promoting the state’s various agribusiness sectors, keeping the food supply safe, and — since 2024 — handling all inspections of places that sell food, such as restaurants and cafeterias.
The agency needs a leader who “feels what rural South Carolina feels, knows what they need and has a plan to do something about it,” Cannon told the SC Daily Gazette this week.
Cannon says that’s him, stressing that he spent his entire life on his family’s farm in tiny Turbeville, a town of fewer than 800 people.
The 44-year-old married father of a teenager believes the agency needs to do more to support rural farmers. His farm grows row crops, including corn and soybeans, along with 30 different kinds of produce, plus raises cattle to sell angus beef.
But it’s become harder for farmers like him to find grocery stores or corn or soybean mills that will buy his products, Cannon said. Struggling farmers are selling their land to developers, he said, reducing the amount of farmland in the state.
Cannon touted himself as the candidate with “real farming experience.” He said he understands the problems rural farmers face and knows how to convince people of the value of buying their food locally.
West said that, while he’s not a farmer himself, the industry has “adopted” him after the decades he’s spent working on the business side.
The 61-year-old married father of two spent 24 years as an executive at the poultry processing company Amick Farms in Batesburg-Leesville. After retiring in 2023 from that job, he began working for the Department of Agriculture as director of market development. He’s also an agricultural liaison to the state Department of Environmental Services.
In his existing role at the agency he wants to lead, he’s focused on expanding the “markets” where farmers can sell their products, and he said he’s built relationships with business owners and convinced them of the value of locally grown food. His experience on the business side of agriculture is just what the job of commissioner calls for, he said.
The South Carolina constitution sets the agriculture commissioner as an elected office. In this historically agrarian state, agribusiness remains a top industry.
And the commissioner tends to keep the job for a while, with one major exception.
In the last century, there have been seven commissioners. The last Democrat, Leslie Tindal, switched parties during his third term, then retired in 2002 after 20 years in the role.
Weathers was appointed to the position in 2004 by then-Gov. Mark Sanford after Charles Sharpe, a former Aiken County legislator, was indicted on federal extortion and money laundering charges less than two years after his win.
In 2005, the former chairman of the state House agriculture committee pleaded guilty to taking a $10,000 bribe to protect a cockfighting ring and was sentenced to two years in prison.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/869ff0_97785afdd0dd485ab6b0fd93e1600f76mv2.jpg.avif,,,2026-01-27 18:57:26.539966

Barre City owns all the land around its reservoir, but it can’t completely control what happens on the body of water.

Sometimes, the law is a head scratcher.
Take, for example, the Thurman W. Dix Reservoir, a little over 100-acre pond in Orange that serves as Barre City’s water supply. 
The Granite City owns all the land around the reservoir, allowing fishing access at two designated points and granting hunting permission through permits. But because the reservoir provides clean water to thousands of Vermonters, the city tightly controls what happens on and around the pond — and posts the property accordingly. 
So imagine Nicolas Storellicastro’s frustration when he, the city manager, discovered that the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation had permitted multiple fishing tournaments on the reservoir for 2026, despite the lack of public access. 
Tuesday, Barre City’s top administrator was seeking help from the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee.
According to Storellicastro, the state told him that because tournament attendees could technically “parachute in” to the reservoir, thus avoiding the private property boundary, the state permitted the tournaments. 
In response, Barre City plans to station police at the reservoir during the February and June tournaments to trespass attendees, according to Storellicastro, paying police overtime to stop the tournament in its tracks. 
“We’re unfortunately going to have some possible confrontations between people trying to access this tournament and us trespassing them,” he said, calling the situation “completely avoidable.”
It’s the sort of fiasco lawmakers hope to prevent with S.224, a bill that would, in part, give towns authority to regulate the use of a public water body used as a municipal drinking source if the municipality owns or controls the surrounding land. 
S.224 would give Barre’s City Council the authority to decide what happens on the Dix Reservoir, a power the city currently lacks. 
Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington, the committee chair, suggested the bill could address concerns beyond pollution, like the possibility that invasive zebra mussels gum up Barre’s water system if they were introduced in the reservoir.  
Like the Dix reservoir, other public water sources across the state are open to some public recreation, such as Berlin Pond, which hydrates Montpelier, and Lake Champlain. 
Unlike those larger bodies of water, though, Dix is more susceptible to contamination due to its small size, Storellicastro said. “Dilution is the solution to pollution,” he quipped, but Barre’s not equipped to handle intense toxins. 

In the know
U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has had enough of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
“You cannot look at the job that she is doing and say that she should stay in that position,” Balint told reporters at the Statehouse Tuesday. Amid the federal government’s deadly immigration crackdown in Minneapolis in recent weeks, Noem should be impeached — unless she quits or President Donald Trump removes her from her post first, Balint said.
Noem “has lied to us repeatedly,” Balint continued, about what transpired in the moments leading up to when federal agents shot and killed both Renee Good and Alex Pretti. In addition, Balint argued that Noem has violated federal law by directing her Federal Emergency Management Administration, or FEMA, to hold up disaster response funding to states in the past year. 
A House impeachment resolution targeting Noem has 140 co-sponsors, including Balint, which is nearly two-thirds of the Democratic caucus, Politico reported Tuesday.

A group of about 30 Vermont House members introduced a resolution Tuesday “strongly supporting the existing U.S.-Denmark treaty related to Greenland and opposing American efforts to secure sovereignty over the island.” The measure’s lead sponsor is Rep. Will Greer, D-Bennington. 
The resolution, J.R.H.7, was sent to the House Government Operations and Military Affairs Committee for further consideration.

Nick Deml, former commissioner of the Vermont Department of Corrections, will lead the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City. 
Federal district judge Laura Taylor Swain picked Deml for the role Tuesday, the New York Times reported. 
In May, the judge first decided an outside official — rather than a member of the mayor’s staff — should run the jail complex as a “remediation manager,” years into federal oversight of the scandal-plagued institution.  
Deml stepped down from his Vermont post in August after almost four years on the job. He previously worked for the CIA and said he would begin consulting on prison-related issues following his departure.

On the move
Vermont’s House Appropriations Committee voted out its version of this year’s annual tuneup to state spending, the Budget Adjustment Act, on Monday. 
The committee’s proposal would direct $5 million to help soften the blow of federal funding reductions to the Section 8 housing program, which helps thousands of Vermonters cover rent. That money would come from a pot of funds already earmarked in the budget for the current fiscal year, which ends in June, to plug potential federal funding cuts.
The legislation, which passed House Approps with unanimous support, is set to be up for second reading on the floor Thursday.

(Joshua Bowling/Source NM)Physicians, rural New Mexicans and behavioral health professionals joined a state lawmaker Tuesday morning in calling for the passage of legislation that could help the state shoulder coverage gaps created by the Trump administration’s health care cuts.
A small crowd gathered in a Roundhouse committee room to back House Bill 4, sponsored by Rep. Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe), which would direct 100% of revenue from taxes on health insurance premiums to the state’s Health Care Affordability Fund, beginning in September. Currently, a combination of health insurance premium taxes and money from the state’s general fund contribute to the Health Care Affordability Fund.
The bill’s backers say that directing more tax revenue to the fund would lend stability to a situation currently marked by its instability — as threats of federal Medicaid cuts loom, health care advocates estimated as many as 100,000 New Mexicans could lose their health care coverage. New Mexico has the highest per-capita enrollment in Medicaid in the nation.
“New Mexico is heading toward a coverage crisis,” New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty Health Care Director Abuko Estrada said. The Legislature created the fund in 2021, but that alone is no longer adequate, he said. “Having this tool isn’t enough. What matters is if we fully leverage it in this moment.”
Taking back New Mexicans’ data privacy

As Estrada called on lawmakers to pass HB4, one lawmaker down the hall called on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to authorize the Legislature to vote on a measure that would give New Mexicans greater digital privacy.
Sen. Angel Charley (D-Acoma) joined representatives from Equality NM and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico and called on Lujan Grisham to put Senate Bill 53, known as the Community and Health Information Safety and Privacy Act, on her legislative agenda for the rest of the session. The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment on whether Lujan Grisham would include it.
If passed, the legislation would place greater restrictions on how tech companies can use certain data — including faceprints and other biometric data — tracked on smartphone apps and websites.
“Safety is not just physical,” Charley said to a standing-room only crowd on the third floor of the Roundhouse. “Our health, our bodies, our children, our lives — they are not for sale.”
NM Oil and Gas Association president: Energy transition not likely in our lifetime
In a New Mexico PBS interview with Capital & Main writer Jerry Redfern, New Mexico Oil and Gas Association President and CEO Missi Currier said New Mexico will one day transition away from the oil and gas industry, which for years has generated billions of dollars of revenue for the state.
“Is it going to happen in our lifetime?” she asked. “Probably not.”
In the interview, republished in Source NM, Currier outlined her hopes for the ongoing 30-day legislative session, statewide emissions and more.

The nonprofit NM Native Vote urged members in an email this week to call the governor’s office and seek Lujan Grisham’s approval for Senate Bill 39, which would increase utility regulators’ oversight for on-site power grids for proposed data centers and other projects. 
“Tribal and rural communities often face the highest energy costs, least reliable service, and greatest exposure to pollution and climate impacts,” NM Native Vote said in its newsletter Tuesday. “SB39 ensures that microgrid development strengthens New Mexico by centering clean energy, accountability and community protections.”
Lujan Grisham’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Sponsor Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) told Source NM he has not heard about any message from the governor’s office allowing the legislation to be heard, and said recent developments in southern New Mexico — including the massive Project Jupiter data center complex in Santa Teresa and a Lea County data center with a planned microgrid — mean the Legislature should take on the bill to bolster oversight.
“Project Jupiter will emit the equivalent of three or four large coal-fired power plants or 2.6 million cars a year. It’s urgent that microgrids be addressed,” he said.
Tax exemption on affordable housing labor and materials
Lawmakers on the Senate Tax, Business and Transportation Committee Tuesday heard arguments over whether to eliminate gross receipts taxes on supplies and labor used to build affordable housing.
Senate Bill 92, sponsored by Sens. Cindy Nava and Michael Padilla, both Albuquerque Democrats, would let contractors and construction material vendors deduct gross receipts taxes on multi-family housing projects for those earning 80% or less of the area’s median income. 
Advocates said the bill would spur additional affordable housing investment in a state with an estimated affordable housing shortage of 32,000 units. But advocates for cities, including the New Mexico Municipal League and the city of Albuquerque’s lobbyist, opposed it. Local governments receive 40% of gross receipts tax revenue; the rest goes to the state. 
A fiscal analysis estimates that local governments statewide would annually lose more than $4 million in gross receipts tax revenues if the deduction went into effect, assuming a baseline of 670 affordable units built each year with a “small uptick” the deduction prompts. However, analysts said lack of housing and material cost data statewide make accurate analyses difficult.
The committee didn’t vote on the bill and instead postponed action on it and a series of other tax proposals. But lawmakers are considering the housing and other proposals heard Tuesday for a potential comprehensive tax package.
Looking ahead
The Senate Conservation Committee bumped Senate Bill 18 from its agenda Tuesday and rescheduled its discussion on the Clear Horizons Act to Thursday morning. Sponsored by Senate Pro Tempore Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque), SB18 would enshrine New Mexico’s greenhouse gas emission reduction goals into law. Similar legislation failed last year.
The House Judiciary Committee is slated to hear House Bill 9 — the Immigrant Safety Act — Wednesday afternoon. If approved, HB9 would prohibit local and state government entities in New Mexico from participating in federal immigration detention contracts. The bill advanced through its first committee last week along party lines on a 4-2 vote.
The House Government, Elections and Indian Affairs Committee on Wednesday will discuss House Bill 93, which would increase the standard deduction on income tax. The Senate Education Committee will review Senate Bill 64, which would permanently establish the Office of Special Education, a priority of Lujan Grisham’s.
Day of solidarity with Minnesota
Lawmakers from more than two dozen states are planning to participate in a “day of solidarity” for Minnesota on Thursday, where federal agents have so far killed two people this year. The organization State Futures, which organizes Democrat lawmakers across the nation, in a statement said a New Mexico lawmaker is among those who plan to participate virtually. Source NM asked organizers, who did not immediately respond to the request, who from the Roundhouse will attend.

Major school districts such as Little Rock School District, Fayetteville Public Schools and Jonesboro Public Schools will be closed. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced state offices would be closed except for critical operations as well, with state employees working remotely if they are able.
The winter storm swept through Arkansas and several other states over the weekend. It resulted in the deaths of two people riding all-terrain vehicles and injured nine others, the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management said.
The division has urged Arkansans to avoid unnecessary travel. While many parts of the state saw temperatures above freezing Tuesday, overnight temperatures are not expected to stay above freezing for at least a week, the National Weather Service said.
The Arkansas Department of Transportation’s online map showed Tuesday afternoon that many of the state’s major roads are still being affected to some degree by snow, sleet or ice.
The storm has caused fatalities and widespread power outages in other states. Neighboring Louisiana has reported eight deaths, while Tennessee has reported five.

(Courtesy of South Dakota Department of Corrections)SIOUX FALLS — Unless he misbehaves in the next year and a half, a state prison inmate won’t serve any additional time in a case that accused him of providing the drugs that killed a fellow inmate.
The outcome came two months after a court hearing where prosecutors apologized for a failure by the state Department of Corrections to preserve some evidence.
Manarion Fuse, 22, is one of two people charged with drug crimes in the death of Anthony Richards, whose February 2025 death was ruled an overdose.
Eight people died of confirmed or suspected overdoses in South Dakota prisons last year, starting with Richards, a prison overdose tally that was both higher than any surrounding state and higher than South Dakota has seen in modern memory. 
As with all but one of the eight cases, Richards’ death was linked to a synthetic drug called K2.
Prison officials and Attorney General Marty Jackley’s office have pledged to address the crush of drug incidents through security policy changes and prosecutions.
Fuse is the first person to enter a plea for a crime linked to one of the 2025 overdoses.
In a statement Tuesday, Jackley said the sentence for Fuse may not have been ideal, but it does offer some closure in the Richards case.
“Even though there was some evidence not available that likely impacted the sentence — through no fault of investigators or prosecutors — there was both a criminal conviction and sentence.”
No contest, no additional time
In court Tuesday, Fuse pleaded no contest to a charge of felony drug possession in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining charges against him and a sentence that won’t change his initial parole date, which comes next May. People pleading no contest do not admit guilt, but it allows a judge to impose a sentence as though they had.
Such a plea also sidesteps the legal requirement for a judge to read a factual basis statement into the record that includes the date, time and manner in which the pleading party committed a crime.
Fuse had argued that other inmates and staff members may have been involved in distributing the drugs that reportedly killed Richards at the state penitentiary’s Jameson Annex. 
State apologizes, but can’t explain missing evidence in prison overdose case

At a hearing in November, Assistant Attorney General Ryan McFall apologized for the state’s failure to produce some of the evidence Fuse’s lawyer Kylie Beck had requested to prepare his defense.
The prosecution had turned over all the evidence delivered to prosecutors by the Department of Corrections, McFall said, but said videos of alleged drug deliveries to Fuse had not been preserved.
Beck, of the Minnehaha County Public Defender’s Office, said Tuesday that her client agreed to the plea deal to avoid a trial, at which he’d run the risk of convictions for more than one offense and face sentencing as a habitual offender.
“Mr. Fuse is not admitting any sort of guilt, but understands that this will appear as a conviction on his record,” Beck said.
McFall offered no comments aside from encouraging Judge Jon Sogn to follow the terms of the plea agreement, which capped Fuse’s sentence at three years, with two suspended, to run concurrent with Fuse’s 2024 sentence for discharging a firearm at an occupied structure.
Sogn added two years of suspended time, which could be imposed if Fuse fails to pay a $65 fee or misbehaves while on probation.
Fuse’s co-defendant, Malibu Lynn Ross, is scheduled for a change of plea and sentence hearing on March 4.
First sentence in spate of overdose deaths
Jackley’s office indicted Fuse in June, the first of what became several rounds of overdose-related prison drug indictments. More people were charged in September for the death of Nicholas Skorka, and still more were charged in December in the death of Travis Long Fox.
On Monday, Jackley announced charges for 11 people allegedly involved in the drug distribution ring linked to the November death of Timothy Tyree at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield.
Three of the people indicted thus far formerly worked at a prison, one as a correctional officer in Sioux Falls, another as a medical aid in Sioux Falls and a third as a contract food service worker in Springfield.
Investigations into the remaining drug deaths are ongoing, Jackley said Monday.
Prairie Crowe, Richards’ sister, told South Dakota Searchlight on Tuesday that her family had been informed of the terms of the Fuse plea deal. 
The family is disappointed by the outcome, but Crowe said she puts the blame on the Department of Corrections, not prosecutors. The department needs to “step up” its efforts to protect the inmates in its care, she said, react more quickly when inmates are in trouble and do a better job investigating when things go wrong. 
“They’re responsible for making sure people get home, and they’re not doing it,” Crowe said. 
In a statement Tuesday, corrections spokesman Michael Winder said the department “cannot comment on ongoing investigations, criminal cases, lawsuits, or security sensitive matters.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)More than 102,000 Rhode Islanders needed help putting food on the table when federal food benefits were halted last November during the government shutdown — the highest number ever recorded by the Rhode Island Community Food Bank.
That’s according to the Providence-based nonprofit’s 2025 hunger report released Tuesday, which found that even before the federal shutdown’s impact on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), one in three families across the Ocean State experienced food insecurity.
“Rhode Island households entered 2025 already under significant strain from rising housing, food, and health care costs,” Melissa Cherney, the food bank’s CEO, wrote in the report’s introduction. “When the federal government shutdown occurred in the fall — disrupting federal nutrition programs in the process — it exposed just how fragile food security remains for tens of thousands of our neighbors.”
Findings of the report were presented during a press conference Tuesday afternoon inside the State House library, coinciding with “Food Insecurity Awareness Day” to get legislative leaders on board with further funding the food bank’s operations.
“We need meaningful policy change and robust investment to truly make change toward ending hunger,” Cherney told the crowd.
Gov. Dan McKee’s proposed fiscal year 2027 budget would double general fund allocations to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank from $1 million to $2 million. Cherney encouraged state lawmakers in attendance to support.
In the audience was House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi. He did not formally endorse McKee’s recommendation in his remarks to the crowd. 
“It will be under consideration as part of the budget proposal that will be adopted in June,” House spokesperson Larry Berman said in a text message to Rhode Island Current.
Still Shekarchi spoke of the need to ensure residents get the food they need.
“It’s 2026,” he said. “And there are more people facing food insecurity than I can remember.”

While the House leader has not taken a formal stance on funding, a proposal recently introduced by a lawmaker whose district includes the food bank would allocate even more to the nonprofit than what McKee has called for. 
The resolution sponsored by Rep. Scott Slater, a Providence Democrat, calls on the state to provide $3 million for fiscal years 2026 and 2027.
“We will not abandon the hungry in Rhode Island,” Slater told the crowd. “We will continue to work together and not rest until every Rhode Islander can go to sleep at night with a full stomach and without the stress of wondering when their next meal will come.”
Companion legislation is sponsored in the Senate by Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat. Mack told the crowd securing funding is especially personal for her as someone who grew up in a food insecure household.
“We all have a food story,” she said. “Each and every one of us is closer today than we’d like to admit — and should be comfortable with — to living with food insecurity.”
Slater and Mack’s bills were referred to their chamber’s respective finance committees, which have yet to hold an initial hearing for either piece of legislation.

Federal action delays release
The annual report listing how many households across the state struggle to afford adequate meals and receive food assistance is typically released around Thanksgiving, relying on data compiled by Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island and the Brown University School of Public Health as part of its annual RI Life Index survey. 
That data is collected from surveys conducted between March through July.
Because the RI Life Index survey data preceded the 43-day federal government shutdown that triggered severe SNAP disruptions last fall, it does not capture the full picture of need.“Demand across the charitable food network increased later in the year, underscoring how quickly food insecurity can worsen when federal support is disrupted,” the report states.
Connecting for Children and Families in Woonsocket, saw an increase of 50 new families every day because of the government shutdown, its executive director, Erin Spaulding, said. That was on top of the 250 regulars who were already using the organization’s food pantry on a weekly basis.
“It’s the highest demand we’ve ever seen — it’s not OK,” she said. “It’s unconscionable.” 
SNAP benefits are now guaranteed through Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year, but concerns over food security remain. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law last July by President Donald Trump makes extensive changes to the federal program.
The new law imposes work requirements on adult SNAP recipients who are capable of working and are younger than 64 and without dependents younger than 14. Previously, those with dependents 18 or younger and those older than 54 were not subject to SNAP work requirements.
It also removes exemptions for people experiencing homelessness, veterans and former foster youth under the age of 25.
Those subject to work requirements must work at least 80 hours a month, or be participating in education, training or volunteer work to receive SNAP benefits for longer than three months within a three-year period.
The new law also cuts off refugees and asylum seekers from federal food assistance. In Rhode Island, an estimated 2,300 people will lose SNAP benefits due to their immigration status starting Feb. 1, according to an Oct. 30 report by the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services.
“Taken together, these changes are expected to increase demand on the charitable food system at a time when it is already operating at or beyond capacity,” the food bank’s report states.
Altogether, Cherney projects around 19,000 Rhode Islanders will either be off SNAP or face significant rollbacks. As of December, the report noted 137,753 residents in the Ocean State received SNAP benefits.
With the incoming federal fallout in mind, the food bank’s report recommends state officials increase investment toward hunger relief, create a task force on food insecurity, and fully prepare for SNAP changes.
“Hunger is solvable,” Cherney said Thursday. “If anyone can do it, we can do it here in Rhode Island.”

Public decried January vote as unnecessary and cruel. Appropriations chair Bear assured it was an accounting maneuver and “the funding was never ever in jeopardy.”
The post Lawmakers will not strip $58M in tribal health funds from budget appeared first on WyoFile .","What was widely interpreted — and decried — as a $58-million budget cut to tribal health services was actually an accounting maneuver, the chairman of Wyoming’s budgeting committee said Tuesday. 
“The funding was never ever in jeopardy,” Rep. John Bear assured lawmakers and health care advocates gathered at Central Wyoming College in Riverton for the Select Committee on Tribal Relations meeting. 
Bear’s announcement over Zoom was met with surprise and relief, even by fellow lawmakers who believed their colleagues had indeed cut the funds. It also came minutes after a crowd of protesters stood near the building entrance on the college campus to demand that legislators reverse what many believed was a cruel and unnecessary cut.
The reduction would have curtailed federal spending authority for the Indian Health Service, preventing tribal facilities from receiving higher reimbursement rates required by the federal government.
Medicaid reimbursements are a crucial part of funding that has helped Wind River Family and Community Health Care grow into the largest employer in Fremont County, CEO Rick Brannan told the committee.

Wind River Cares, as it’s commonly called, operates clinics and health services across reservation communities and beyond. Brannan expressed immense relief that the funding will not be stripped. 
“I am so grateful, because without the funding, our people would die,” Brannan said.  
Budget vote backlash
The perceived cut took place during a budget meeting of the Joint Appropriations Committee on Jan. 13. The JAC, as it’s commonly known, was in the middle of weeks of hearings on the governor’s draft budget. That morning, Sheridan Republican Rep. Ken Pendergraft announced he would propose several cuts as the committee walked through the Wyoming Health Department’s budget. The state has become “addicted” to government intervention, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus-aligned legislator said.
When the topic of federal spending authority for the Indian Health Service came up, Pendergraft proposed a $58 million reduction. 
The Indian Health Service is a federal program responsible for providing health care services to Native Americans. The funds were earmarked to cover All-Inclusive Rate increases for tribal medical facilities. Those increases are federally mandated. 
JAC member Rep. Trey Sherwood, D-Laramie, interjected to note that the funds in question were 100% federal and Wyoming Medicaid is legally required to adopt the new rates. 
“This is an ask for a [spending] increase,” Pendergraft responded. “And as I’ve stated before, I believe that … the first thing that needs to be done is to stop the acceleration.”
Other lawmakers on the committee pushed back. Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, called Pendergraft’s proposal “draconian.” 
“What you’re doing is, while trying to slow down the train, you’re throwing our tribal members under it,” Gierau said.

But Bear defended Pendergraft. 
“I think my colleagues that are pushing for more spending make an impassioned argument about services, but also somebody needs to look out for the taxpayer,” Bear said. “And I think those people who are voting against expanding Medicaid further are looking out for the taxpayer.”
The committee passed the amendment 9-3. 
In the wake of that vote, outcry has mounted over what critics see as a harmful decision that will result in denied care to vulnerable patients. Those views were on display Tuesday at CWC as protesters shouted slogans like “honor the treaties.” 
Under separate treaties between the U.S. government and Wind River Reservation tribes, the federal government is obligated to provide health care. 
Tribes can opt to administer their own health care services, as both the Eastern Shoshone and the Northern Arapaho tribes have done with their so-called “638” clinics. Even under that arrangement, however, the Indian Health Service and federal government must still uphold treaty obligations by financially supporting the facilities.
Rapid reset 
The Tribal Relations committee invited Rep. Bear to speak to the issue during its meeting. Bear started by stating that the program, which has been fully funded since 1995, will continue to be funded. 
The cut was not a cut at all, he said, but a new accounting strategy. Because reimbursement rates have been varying wildly in recent years, the JAC removed the expenditure so that it could avoid having to adjust based on the most current rate, he said. It turns out that the $58 million was overestimated, Bear continued, because based on the newly announced rates, the actual amount is $41 million. 
“Never was the full funding from the federal government based on these adjustments ever at risk,” Bear said. “I just want to make that really clear.”

The Joint Appropriations Committee will likely take action before the budget session begins Feb. 9 to approve that $41 million spending authority, he said. 
His message prompted celebration. 
“I am thrilled beyond measure at the good chairman’s comments,” said Gierau, who also joined via Zoom. “The bottom line is, I’m just immensely gratified after a 9-3 vote against it … that this full funding is going to occur.” 
“I think we should stop and kind of savor this moment,” said Tribal Relations Co-chair Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander. “I can’t even begin to say what a good day this is.”

Windsor County Sheriff Ryan Palmer is facing 12 criminal charges after he was arrested Tuesday for a slew of sex crimes.
The Vermont State Police began investigating Palmer in July after receiving anonymous tips about possible mismanagement of funds within the sheriff’s office, according to a state police press release. 
“During the investigation, (state police) received more anonymous tips pertaining to the financial situation and also information about alleged sexual misconduct regarding Palmer,” the release said. 
Palmer is facing two counts of lewd and lascivious conduct, two counts of solicitation of prostitution, two counts of aggravated stalking with a weapon, two counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of inciting a felony and two counts of accessory before the fact. 
Several victims provided the state police with witness statements supporting the allegations of sexual misconduct, police said. State troopers then arrested Palmer at the sheriff’s office in Woodstock and took him into custody before releasing him later that day.
Palmer is set to be arraigned on the charges Wednesday in Rutland County criminal court. 
In 2017, Palmer was acquitted by a jury on charges including aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after shooting a man during an undercover operation in 2014, according to the Valley News. Palmer also failed to keep up with legally required paperwork in his office, sometimes waiting over a year to file necessary appointment documents for deputies he hired in his office, according to the Valley News. 
Palmer did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Rashida Tlaib and several climate and health activists met with reporters to lay out the costs of loosening restrictions on soot pollution.
In a Tuesday press call hosted by Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action, the Detroit Democrat and members of the American Lung Association and MI Air MI Health warned that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s move to roll back particulate matter standards defies medical science while threatening to bring further harm to communities burdened with pollution. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While former President Joe Biden’s administration announced a final rule in 2024 to strengthen regulations on particulate matter pollution, the Trump Administration revisited the standards “to aid manufacturing,” calling them “a major obstacle to permitting.”
In November, the administration filed a case with the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit asking them to vacate the final rule, which the Biden Administration estimated would prevent up to 4,500 premature deaths. The rules remain in effect until the court makes a ruling. 
Teresa Homsi, the executive director of Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action explained that particulate matter pollution is tied to several respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological issues, with pollutants making their way into the lungs and bloodstream. 
Multiple speakers argued the EPA had abandoned its mission to protect human health and the environment, with Homsi pointing to the agency’s recent decision to stop calculating how much money air pollution restrictions save in health care costs and how many deaths are prevented.
“If a standard can save thousands of lives, eliminating it amounts to letting thousands of people die,” Homsi said. “And for the EPA, that’s an uncomfortable, inconvenient truth.”

Kindra Weid, a registered nurse working in an intensive care unit in Washtenaw County, explained that these pollutants are made up of a toxic soup of vapors, gasses and particles which can damage the heart, lungs and brain. 
Short and long term exposure to soot increases the risk of heart disease and premature death from cardiovascular conditions, Weid said. It can also damage cells and tissues in the lungs, worsening conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Kezia Ofosu Atta, the director of advocacy in Ohio and Michigan for the American Lung Association, noted the particular impact the rollback of these changes would have on Detroit, which the association graded a “D” for particle pollution in its 2025 State of the Air report. 
Southwest Detroit has some of the highest levels of air pollution in the nation, largely stemming from a heavy industrial presence and emissions from vehicles. 
“I know, as a girl that grew up in southwest Detroit, how incredibly dehumanizing it felt that nobody cared about me breathing clean air,” Tlaib said. 
The 2024 final rule set a bare minimum for clean air standards, Tlaib said, and without those protections, families who live in neighborhoods near industrial facilities could see even greater harms. 
Tlaib noted that many industrial facilities in the area violate their air quality permits without being held accountable, later calling on the state to take stronger role in enforcing these permits, and for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to work hand in hand with the state’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy to determine whether a permit protects public health and the environment.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-3.45.21-PM-scaled-e1769555304702-1024x579.png,,,2026-01-27 18:57:26.539966

On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committee approved a joint resolution for a proposed constitutional amendment to reduce property taxes that will now go to the full House of Representatives for a vote.
That makes three joint resolutions to date that have cleared all of their assigned committees and will now move to the chamber’s floor. However, there have been no corresponding companion measures in the Florida Senate, meaning that all of these proposals could end up going nowhere by the time the session is due to end on March 13.
“We have another chamber that apparently doesn’t have any interest in talking about these very important subjects,” cracked Rep. Philip Griffitts, R-Panama City Beach, in his closing argument before the committee.
Gov. Ron DeSantis, House Speaker Daniel Perez, and Senate President Ben Albritton have all said that they are united in giving voters this November a chance to reduce property taxes on homesteaded properties. And all three of them now say that it would be preferable if there were just one such initiative for Floridians to vote on.
However, only the House seems intent on doing something about the issue during the session. While DeSantis hasn’t said that he will call for the Legislature to meet in a special session to deal with the issue in the spring, it’s apparent that, at least to date, he’s not that interested in pushing anything right now. Nor has the Senate shown any interest in doing so — thus far, at least.
Griffitt’s joint resolution would work differently than the others that have advanced so far. It would limit annual rate increases to 3% or the change in inflation (whichever is lower) for homestead properties to apply every third year instead of each year. The proposed amendment also would change the assessment increase limitation for non-homestead property to be 15% every third year, instead of 10%.
“This is not a cut,” Griffitts told the committee. “We keep hearing about a tax cut. This not a tax cut, this is a cap. … It’s going to require local governments to make hard decisions. To prioritize what they want to spend on.”
As has been the case in other committee meetings, the public comment portion was dominated by locally elected officials making the case that a drastic reduction in property tax revenues would be devastating for their communities.
Local officials again show their disapproval
Woody Brown is mayor of Largo, a city in Pinellas County with about 85,000 residents. He told the committee that property taxes bring in approximately $44 billion annually, whereas the budget for police and fire is about $69 million. Since 2020, the costs to provide for public safety has outpaced the growth in property tax revenues, he said, and any “significant reduction in ad valorem revenue would result in cutting essential services that our residents expect.”
Those reduced revenues could result in reducing library hours, closing or neglecting the maintenance of city parks, or delaying roadway or sidewalk repairs, he said.
A rare Democratic amendment is added 
While the proposal again passed on a strict party-line vote, with Republicans in support and Democrats in opposition, Broward County Democratic Rep. Christine Hunschofsky did have an amendment approved by the committee that would prevent an assessed tax increase in a three-year period if the just value of the property had either stayed the same or decreased.
Hunschofsky said that many constituents reached out to her to offer the proposal.
“So, their property value had decreased, for example, in their condos by like $40,000, but because there was a spread between their property value and their assessed value, their assessed value increased so the tax they had to pay went up,” she said.
In addition to the three joint resolutions on their way to the floor, another four joint resolutions sponsored by Republican members of the House remain alive in various committees.
For a joint resolution to become a constitutional amendment, it must be approved by three-fifths of the members of both the House and Senate. Once on the statewide ballot, it must receive 60% support to become law.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Highlights_from_Orlando_Florida-_City_scenes_housing_construction_new_homes_Jones_High_School_-_DPLA_-_a3e69cb8129fb4a42a5c44b4498065c6.jpg,,,2026-01-27 18:57:26.539966

There’s probably nothing more iconic to Montana than boots, cowboy hats, cattle and ranching, something that defines the image of the Treasure State. And there is probably no other blocs of voters that Montana politicians sidle up next to more than ranchers, often copying their dress, down to the belt buckle.
That’s why a coalition of organizations representing the state’s cattlemen and ranchers was remarkable in Billings on Tuesday as they specifically called out three-quarters of the state’s Congressional delegation for their lack of support of country-of-origin labeling for beef, something they said is costing not just cattle producers but consumers at the grocery market.
Only Rep. Ryan Zinke, Montana’s western Congressman, has announced support for mandatory country-of-origin labeling legislation for beef.
Country-of-origin labels had been used until 2015, when it was repealed due to concerns by the World Trade Organization. But, the advocates on Tuesday said world of cattle buying and selling has changed, as consolidation in the meat packing business has created an oligarchy of four large multinational producers who often don’t disclose where their beef is coming from, or instead, will label it as American because it was slaughtered and packaged domestically.

The coalition, including the U.S. Cattlemen’s Association, R-Calf, Northern Plains Resource Council, the Montana Farmers Union, the National Farmers Organization, the Montana Cattlemen’s Association, Abundant Montana and the Yellowstone Valley Food Hub, said they believe American consumers are willing to pay more for American-sourced beef, but may not have that option because of the labeling. Instead, inferior beef products from other countries may be mixed into the food chain.
Two pieces of legislation exist in Washington, D.C., that would reinstitute mandatory country-of-origin labeling, Senate Bill 421 and House Resolution 5818. Currently, any country-of-origin labeling is optional. However, beef producers on Tuesday said that consumers already know where fruits, vegetables and some other meats are sourced, and the same should be true with beef.
The coalition were also critical of Montana’s two U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, both Republicans who have not signed onto either bill, or said they support the legislation. Rep. Troy Downing has also not announced a position on country-of-origin labeling.
The Daily Montanan reached out to all three offices on Tuesday afternoon, with questions about their support or positions, but only Sheehy’s office responded by publication time.
“Sen. Sheehy believes American beef should be labeled as American beef. As a rancher, he knows firsthand the challenges we face with the over-consolidation of corporate agriculture and the introduction of foreign entities into the American food system,” a spokesperson said. “For too long, foreign-owned meat packers have controlled our food supply, and Senator Sheehy believes we must break that monopoly and offer American alternatives to increase our national food security. Bringing profitability back to agriculture is one of Sen. Sheehy’s top priorities, and he is firmly committed to ensuring that American ranchers and cattle are placed at the center of our livestock policy framework to keep American ag alive and strong.”
Bruce Shultz, a member of the National Farmers Organization, who ranches in Raynesford, said that he and many producers saw their prices plummet the year after Congress rescinded mandatory country-of-origin labeling. Shultz said he lost nearly 40% of the value of his market cattle the next year because large packing companies could drive down prices by buying from nearly two dozen other countries, and have a similar product on store shelves without consumers knowing the difference.

The groups also said that mandatory country-of-origin labeling must be included in the Farm Bill to make meaningful change. They said that labels should say the country of origin for the animal, and not just where it was slaughtered or packaged.
Montana’s cattle industry has been hit hard in the recent decade as domestic cattle herds have reached their lowest point in 70 years, and the leaders warned that younger generations will not return to the ranch unless there is more transparency for the end customer.
Benjamin Peterson of the Montana Farmers Union from Judith Gap told the audience that since 1980, more than half the cattle ranches have been lost. And, Shultz told the group that from 2017 to 2020, in Ravalli County alone, 150 farms had closed, and more than 50,000 acres was taken out of production.
  Food security 

The ranchers said that the labeling practices driven by the large packing plants are also bad for consumers, who don’t know what they’re buying. He said that for the United State, cattle production is a $100 billion business, with $2 billion contributed to Montana’s state economy.
“The (current) labeling doesn’t tell the truth,” said Samantha Ferret of Toston, who ranches with her husband and serves on the U.S. Cattlemen’s Association. “Why is it not revealed where the beef comes from? This is no accident.”
The group said that if consumers could have the choice between the foreign beef and the kind raised in Montana, they’d be willing to pay a premium, which would, in turn, create more market demand, raise domestic prices and help ranchers rebuild their herds.
The organization said it’s important to label beef in several ways — where it born, raised and processed.
“There has never been a greater demand for beef directly from the producer, and that’s because they want to know what they’re buying,” said Tim Brunner, the western district director of the Montana Cattlemen’s Association from Fairfield. “Why haven’t all the elected officials put their support behind the cattle industry then?”
R-CALF, a Billings-based nation organization that supports just cattle and sheep producers, said that labeling may seem simple, but it sends a powerful message.
“Competition can only happen if the consumers have a choice, and right now the consumers can’t signal a demand for (American) beef,” said Bill Bullard, R-CALF’s chief executive. “It’s a demand signal.”
They said that it will take a coalition like the one they’ve built to demand no support of the Farm Bill without mandatory country-of-origin labeling.
“The only way to know now is if you drive it off the ranch itself,” Peterson said. “We’ve heard that politicians currently want to put America First, well mandatory country-of-origin labeling does that. They should take the easy win.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MCOOL-presser-012726-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-27 18:57:26.539966

The protest was organized by the Sanctuary Alliance and the Kansas Students for Justice in Palestine. Both organizations called upon Lawrence citizens and University of Kansas students and faculty to join high schoolers in the walkout. 
Students participated in protests at both Lawrence High and Free State High School. 
For first-generation student Angelo Reyna, the walkout was for those who can’t speak out due to immigration status or fear, he said.  
“I’m here because my mom is an immigrant,” Reyna said. “What’s happening on the streets of Minnesota is terrible. I’m here to show my solidarity that I disagree with everything that is happening. I use my voice because there are undocumented immigrants who cannot use their voice. I’m very proud I can use mine.”

Freshman Elaina Pollard said she was proud of both high school and middle school students who walked out of class. 
“Not enough people are standing up for this,” Pollard said. “What’s happening in Minnesota is heartbreaking and horrible. It needs to stop. I’m proud of everyone who’s out here in the cold and I’m glad to see so many protesters and KU students with us.”
Middle school students from both Liberty Memorial Central Middle School and Billy Mills Middle School walked to Lawrence High, which is roughly a mile from either building. They held up signs with phrases such as “abolish ICE” and “don’t be an ICE-hole.”
Lawrence Public Schools Superintendent Jeanice Swift released a statement Monday afternoon before the walkout. Swift said the district supports students’ right to protest but that the district remains “viewpoint neutral” on student speech. 
Lawrence High Schools principal Quentin Rials did not respond for comment at the time of publishing. 
Many non-student attendees are regulars at the weekly Sunday protests on Massachusetts Street against the Trump administration as well as ICE. Protesters say they were impressed with the number of students who participated. 
Erika Earles, who graduated from Lawrence High in 1995, said she was proud of current students carrying on the long history of students standing up for their rights, referencing how the Lawrence High School Black Student Union helped integrate the town in the sixties. 
“It’s horrifying what our federal government is doing right now, and I wanted to come out and support the kids at LHS standing up for what’s right,” Earles said.

A judge on Tuesday struck down a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed lawmakers to redraw congressional districts mid-decade. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)A Virginia circuit court on Tuesday struck down a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at giving lawmakers the option to redraw congressional districts mid-decade, dealing a major setback to Democratic legislative leaders who say the change is needed to respond to partisan gerrymandering in some Republican-led states and had hoped to put the measure before voters in an April referendum.  
In a 22-page ruling issued by the Tazewell County Circuit Court, Judge Jack C. Hurley found that the legislature acted unlawfully when it approved the redistricting amendment during a special legislative session days before the Nov. 4 election, concluding that lawmakers exceeded the scope of that session, violated their own procedural rules and failed to comply with constitutional and statutory requirements governing amendments to the Virginia Constitution. 
As a result, the court declared the amendment process “void ab initio,” meaning legally invalid from the outset. 
 Ruling blocks April vote on redistricting amendment

Democrats had planned to ask voters on April 21 whether the General Assembly should be allowed, under limited circumstances, to redraw congressional and legislative districts between censuses.
Instead, the court ruled that the amendment was improperly adopted and cannot advance to the ballot as scheduled. The judge also barred state election officials from taking further steps to submit the measure to voters unless and until the constitutional requirements are met.
Democratic leaders said they intend to appeal the decision, which they argue improperly blocks voters from weighing in on the proposal. 
The lawsuit was brought by Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, who also serves as a legislative commissioner on the Virginia Redistricting Commission. 
McDougle and other plaintiffs argued that Democrats unlawfully expanded the scope of a 2024 special session that had been convened by then-Gov. Glenn Youngkin primarily to address budget matters, and that they did so after voting for the amendment process had already begun.
In siding with the plaintiffs, the court agreed that while the special session itself was valid, the General Assembly overstepped when it adopted House Joint Resolution 6007 — the resolution proposing the constitutional amendment — because redistricting was not among the matters permitted to be considered during that session under existing House rules and resolutions.
“The special session was allowed to continue, but it did not allow the majority to unilaterally expand the scope of business,” the judge wrote, concluding that lawmakers failed to follow the procedural safeguards they themselves had adopted for calling and conducting a special session.
 Court cites timing, notice failures under state Constitution

The ruling also focused on the timing of the amendment’s passage. 
Under the Virginia Constitution, proposed amendments must be approved by two separately elected General Assemblies, with an intervening general election for the House of Delegates. 
The court found that the amendment was improperly advanced during the 2024 special session and that actions taken during the 2026 regular session could not retroactively cure those defects or satisfy the “next ensuing general election” requirement set out in the constitution.
In addition, the court held that state officials failed to comply with a Virginia statute requiring public posting of proposed constitutional amendments at courthouses and other public locations at least six months before the next general election. 
Because that posting did not occur, the court said election officials are prohibited from submitting the amendment to voters.
Taken together, the court concluded that “any and all matters, motions, actions or votes regarding House Joint Resolution 6007” violated the General Assembly’s own rules and were therefore illegal.
 GOP, allies call decision a victory for rule of law

Republicans and allied advocacy groups hailed the decision as a rebuke of what they described as a partisan end-run around constitutional safeguards.
In a joint statement, McDougle and former U.S. House Speaker Eric Cantor, the honorary co-chair of Virginians for Fair Maps, said the ruling vindicated their argument that Democrats ignored clear legal limits.
“Today’s ruling is a decisive victory for the rule of law and Virginia voters,” the statement said. 
“The court confirmed that Democrat legislative leaders unlawfully expanded a special session, violated their own rules, and attempted to force through a redistricting constitutional amendment while Virginians were already voting.”
The judge, they added, “rightly declared those actions void” from the start. “If they continue to move forward with the unconstitutional amendment process, the Democrats would be defying the order of the court.”
The statement emphasized the GOP’s position that the case was “never about partisanship,” but rather about process and constitutional compliance. “The court made clear that elections matter, notice matters, and the rules apply to everyone — even those in power,” McDougle and Cantor said.
 Democrats blast ruling, promise to appeal

Democratic leaders, however, sharply criticized the ruling and signaled they would fight it.
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who called lawmakers back to Richmond for the special session in October, accused Republicans of using the courts to block a policy they could not defeat politically and said the General Assembly would appeal immediately.
“Nothing that happened today will dissuade us from continuing to move forward and put this matter directly to the voters,” Scott said in a statement. “Republicans who can’t win at the ballot box are abusing the legal process in an attempt to sow confusion and block Virginians from voting.”
Scott called the lawsuit “court-shopping, plain and simple,” and said Democrats are “prepared for the next step.” “Voters — not politicians — will have the final say,” he said.
Judge Hurley was appointed to the court by former Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. 
Advocacy groups aligned with Democrats echoed that message, framing the ruling as a temporary obstacle rather than a final outcome.
Keren Charles Dongo, campaign manager for Virginians for Fair Elections, said she expected the decision to be appealed and warned that the ruling could mislead voters.
“This is a clear attempt to confuse voters and block them from having a say,” Dongo said. “Republicans court-shopped for a ruling because litigation and misinformation are the only tools they have left.”
Dongo added: “We’re prepared for what comes next, and Virginians deserve both the right to vote and the chance to level the playing field.”
The amendment at the center of the dispute grew out of Democratic concerns about efforts in some Republican-led states to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, moves that party leaders have linked to pressure from former President Donald Trump and warned could reshape the national political landscape.
In 2020, Virginia voters approved a constitutional amendment creating a bipartisan redistricting commission to draw legislative and congressional maps. When that commission deadlocked in 2021, the task fell to the Virginia Supreme Court, which adopted maps that Republicans have largely defended and Democrats have criticized as more favorable to the GOP.
Earlier this month, Democrats in the newly organized legislature for a second time advanced the proposed constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly, under narrow conditions, to revisit district lines between censuses — for example, if a court invalidates a map or if federal law changes. 
Supporters argued the amendment would give Virginia a tool to respond more quickly to legal or demographic shifts, rather than locking in maps for a full decade.
Republicans countered that the proposal would reopen the door to partisan gerrymandering and undermine the intent of the voter-approved redistricting commission. They also warned that Democrats were rushing the amendment through an unusual procedural pathway to get it before voters as soon as possible.
Those procedural concerns formed the backbone of McDougle’s lawsuit. 
The court ultimately agreed, finding that while the General Assembly has broad authority to propose constitutional amendments, it must do so in strict compliance with the Virginia Constitution, state law and its own internal rules.
The ruling does not permanently bar lawmakers from pursuing a redistricting amendment in the future, but it does require them to restart the process in a manner consistent with constitutional timelines and procedural requirements.

The law currently only applies if the victim is under the age of 16. 
Rep. Steve Tanner, R-Nampa, introduced the draft bill in the House Judiciary and Rules Committee. He said it was created after a discussion with a member of Idaho Attorney General’s Internet Crimes Against Children team, called ICAC. 
Under current Idaho law, it is a felony for an adult, age 18 or older, to use the internet or a communication device to solicit, seduce, lure, persuade or entice a person under age 16 to engage in sexual acts. The crime is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. 
The proposed bill would add the felony penalty if the victim was 16 or 17 years old and the perpetrator was at least five years older. 
“That avoids what we call Romeo and Juliet sort of scenarios,” Tanner said. 
He said it was consistent with other laws, such as those for statutory rape, where it is only applicable based on age if the victim is 16 or 17 and the other person is three or more years older. 
When the victim is younger than 16, the penalty applies regardless of the age of the perpetrator. 
The committee members unanimously introduced the legislation without discussion. The bill will be eligible to return to the committee for a full public hearing at a later date.

(Photo by Mike Hill/Getty Images)Wolverines in the lower 48 States were trapped, hunted, and poisoned to near extinction in the late 1800s and early 1900s and have not recovered, just the opposite in fact. It took court action by the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and other conservation groups to finally get the dwindling population listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in 2023.
The federal government is legally required to designate “critical habitat” to protect ecosystems for the recovery of threatened and endangered species, but has failed to do so for wolverines, which are hanging on by the thinnest of threads. To stave off extinction, we need to protect the habitat in which they can survive — a challenge now further exacerbated by an increasingly hot climate diminishing the deep snows they require for denning and food storage. 
Wolverine habitat currently exists in portions of Utah, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, California and northern New Mexico.
It’s estimated there are only 318 wolverines remaining in the entire lower 48 States. Scientists believe the “effective population,” which is the number of individuals capable of reproducing and contributing to the next generation, is likely less than 40. 
You read that right, fewer than 40 wolverines are currently capable of keeping the species from going extinct in the contiguous U.S. And what is the U.S. Fish and Wild Service doing to recover wolverines as required by law? Not much.
The Fish and Wildlife Service noted that wolverine populations are relatively small, fragmented, and isolated from larger populations in Canada. In Montana, the areas required for wolverines range from 193 to 588 square miles for males and 55 to 148 square miles for females.
To protect the ecosystems upon which wolverines depend, the Endangered Species Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to designate “critical habitat” — the areas that provide the secure habitat where they are protected from threats like incidental trapping and can successfully reproduce.
The designation of “critical habitat” includes those areas occupied by the species at the time of listing that possess the physical and biological features such as food, water, and shelter needed for survival and recovery. These areas may also include areas not yet occupied but needed for future population growth.
Because critical habitat designation is essential to the conservation of the species, special management consideration or protections may be required.  The designation also guides federal actions to prevent destruction or modification of this habitat, thereby increasing species’ chances of recovery.
Unfortunately the Fish and Wildlife Service has not followed the law, has not designated critical habitat, and is shirking its duty to keep wolverines from extinction — which is why the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and our fellow plaintiffs recently filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Montana. 
Although the majority (95%) of wolverine habitat in the lower 48 states is federally owned and managed by the Forest Service, there are no regulatory mechanisms or standards in Forest Service Land and Resource Management Plans to protect wolverines and their habitat. Not only is nothing being done to protect and restore wolverines and the ecosystems upon which they depend, the Forest Service has announced a massive 25% increase in national forest logging, in effect, destroying what critical habitat may be left on public lands. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service has failed — and continues to fail — to comply with its mandatory, non-discretionary, duty to designate critical habitat for wolverines as required by Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act. To maintain and recover the species our choice was either take the delinquent agency to court or watch wolverines dwindle into extinction.

“What we saw was a city under occupation,” said Jeannie Alexander, an interfaith reverend from Pownal.

More than a dozen Vermont faith leaders traveled to Minneapolis last week to see the impacts of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown first-hand and bolster the ranks of people there who have protested against the government’s actions.
The group of 14 clergy were invited on the trip by local religious leaders. Some of the Vermont leaders were on their way to Minneapolis when federal agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti, according to Vermont Interfaith Action, a group that helped coordinate the visit. Pretti’s killing sparked a wave of new protests across the city two and a half weeks after agents there shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good. 
A total of 3,000 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were operating in the city this past weekend, a force roughly five times the size of the Minneapolis Police Department, according to CBS News. A top ICE official told CBS on Sunday that federal agents had carried out about 3,400 arrests in and around the city, though did not say how many arrestees had criminal records.
Trump’s crackdown in Minnesota appeared to be subsiding somewhat as of Tuesday, though, with the expected departure of Greg Bovino, the controversial commander of U.S. Border Patrol, along with some agents, according to multiple news reports. Border Patrol is the roving law enforcement arm of Customs and Border Protection.
The Vermont clergy joined local organizers tracking federal immigration operations around the city and provided counseling support to those people and others watching nearby, they said. The clergy also joined an estimated tens of thousands of others marching in Friday’s “ICE Out of Minnesota” protest against Trump’s crackdown.
“What we saw was a city under occupation. It was a city being occupied by the federal government — and a government that has turned violent,” said Jeannie Alexander, a reverend at EarthFire Abbey, an interfaith community in Pownal. “So, that was horrifying to see.”
Alexander said it was especially concerning to see how scared some people were to leave their homes. Some organizers the clergy worked alongside were tasked with bringing food and medicine to people who didn’t want to venture out, she said.
Karen Johnston, senior minister at First Unitarian Universalist Society of Burlington, recalled hearing about a colleague’s visit to a shopping center that serves as a hub for the city’s large Somali community. The Trump administration has pointed to a sweeping fraud scandal in Minnesota that prosecutors allege largely involved Somali people as a justification for launching its immigration crackdown there at the end of last year. 
“It’s a ghost town, because people cannot exercise their livelihood for fear of being abducted by ICE,” Johnston said of the complex.
Several of the clergy said they also used the trip as an opportunity to learn strategies for community organizing and nonviolent resistance that would help Vermonters document and respond to federal actions if there was a large-scale immigration crackdown here. 
“I know Vermont is small — and we shouldn’t think that we’re next on the list, because there are plenty of places,” Johnston said. “But, we should not think that we are going to be immune.”
According to Vermont Interfaith Action, the other Vermont clergy on the trip included:

Rev. Ava Bilton, First Congregational Church of Burlington, UCC
Catherine Bock, Burlington Quaker Meeting House  
Rev. Jessica Derise, College Street Congregational Church in Burlington
Rev. Laura Engelken, former minister at Mallets Bay Congregational Church in Colchester
Rabbi David Fainsilber, Jewish Community of Greater Stowe

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Former Alabama Republican Party Chair John Wahl officially announced his candidacy for lieutenant governor Tuesday, just a few days after President Donald Trump’s endorsed Wahl for the office, which he was not publicly seeking.
Wahl joins a slate of other Republicans seeking their party’s nomination for the office during the primary election in May. Wahl resigned as chair of the state’s Republican Party on Friday shortly after he qualified.
“This campaign is going to be rough,” Wahl said during a news conference at Alabama Republican Party headquarters in Hoover. “And it is important for me to stay focused on the things that are most important to the people of the state.”

The lieutenant governor becomes governor if the sitting governor dies or is otherwise removed from office, but has very few powers beyond that. Most of the official duties involve presiding over the Senate.
Wahl was not a candidate until Trump on Thursday, the day before the end of qualifying, unexpectedly called on him to enter the race.
“For me, that was one of the honors of a lifetime,” Wahl said. “I have worked hard in the trenches and fought for people’s rights and freedoms. I have been a competent and bold supporter of the America First agenda.”
Wahl said he would remain in his position as chair of the Alabama Public Library Service, where he has advocated for library policies that critics call censorship.
“I believe he has done great harm to the libraries in this state and maligned the librarians of this state, so I will not support him,” Ron Snider, a member of the APLS board and a critic of Wahl, said in an interview on Monday.
Snider first accused Wahl of using his position as chair for political gain during the APLS board meeting in July after Wahl sent a letter to libraries stating that they must restrict library materials that deal with gender ideology to minors.
Snider accused Wahl a second time at the APLS board meeting in October after he said that representatives from the state’s Republican Party sent out letters to its members that encouraged them to support the administrative code changes that Minton and Wahl proposed to restrict books that dealt with gender ideology.
Wahl said Snider’s remarks are disingenuous.
“Protecting our children from sexually explicit content is not something I would ever welcome,” he said. “It is not something that is political for me. This is something that is foundational.”
Amy Minton, an ally of Wahl’s on the APLS Board, is seeking the Republican nomination for a state Senate district in Etowah County.
Wahl did not announce publicly that he was considering campaigning for the lieutenant governor’s office at the time of Trump’s social media post.
During the news conference, Wahl highlighted several key issues that he would prioritize, from energy independence and reducing taxes for individuals and families in the state, to improving Alabama’ education system and protecting children from harmful content in the classroom.
In qualifying for the race, Wahl joins seven other candidates, including Alabama  Secretary of State Wes Allen, who has called Wahl “Nehemiah Wahl,” his legal name, and accused him of abandoning his obligations to the Alabama GOP. In a Facebook video released over the weekend, Allen criticized Wahl for using a “homemade” voter ID to cast  a ballot.
“We cannot be more different,” Allen said in the video. “I, like President Trump, support voter ID laws while my opponent breaks them.”
al.com reported in 2022 that Wahl cast a ballot using an ID made by then-State Auditor Jim Zeigler, which former Secretary of State John Merrill said was not a valid form of photo ID.  Zeigler told al.com over the weekend that he approved the ID and had it professionally printed by a vendor.
“His comments that I somehow voted with a fake or homemade ID are ridiculous,” Wahl said at the news conference.
Wahl did not respond directly to the rest of Allen’s remarks during the news conference and said that “this is politics. Your opponents are going to go negative.”
He said it is more important that he speak directly to voters and explain to them his view on the issues.
“The party will be just fine without me, but I appreciate him thinking that I am not replaceable in this role, and that my vacancy hurts everyone,” Wahl said of Allen’s comments. “I appreciate he has so much confidence in my leadership abilities as party chairman that he thinks the loss of one person would have that kind of impact on the entire state.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7800-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 17:58:07.132645

That leadership, however, also brings fiscal exposure. Because the Commonwealth expanded Medicaid earlier and more comprehensively than most states, it is particularly vulnerable as federal Medicaid financing erodes and discretionary funding plays a larger role in health care financing.  
In this environment, the state must do all it can to maximize its ability to secure federal health care funding. One meaningful step — rarely discussed outside workforce policy circles — would be to modernize regulations and licensing requirements for physician assistants. Here’s why that matters.   
Last year, the federal government launched the Rural Health Transformation Program, a new initiative that reflects this shift in health care toward discretionary funding. The $50 billion, multi-year program allocates funding not only on population or need, but on workforce capacity, access, and state policy alignment. First-year awards averaged around $200 million per state, though allocations varied widely. Massachusetts received just over $160 million, while multiple states received well above $230 million. These differences underscore how closely federal funding is now tied to workforce policy choices. 
Under the program’s framework, states are assessed on clinician mobility, service continuity, telehealth readiness, and whether regulatory structures enable providers to practice efficiently within modern care models. Importantly, funding levels are recalibrated annually, meaning statutory and regulatory decisions have ongoing fiscal implications. In this environment, workforce law has become a material determinant of federal investment. 
Physician assistants sit squarely within this policy calculus. PAs are nationally certified, state-licensed clinicians who diagnose, treat, and prescribe across specialties and settings. They are well represented in rural and underserved communities and frequently practice in primary care and community-based environments.  
Massachusetts’s regulatory framework for PA practice has not fully kept pace with that reality. The Commonwealth continues to require all physician assistants to work under the direction of an individual supervising physician, who is legally responsible for overseeing that PA’s clinical practice. This requirement is a vestige of an earlier era, when PAs were typically employed directly by individual physicians in small or independent practices. In that model, a one-to-one supervisory relationship reflected both an employment relationship and a legal responsibility for the care provided.  
That is no longer how health care is organized. Today, the vast majority of PAs practice within large hospital systems, community health centers, and multispecialty groups. Teams deliver care, oversight is institutional, and responsibility is shared, not anchored to a single supervising physician. This shift has occurred at the same moment the physician workforce is under growing strain. 
In Massachusetts, nearly one in four physicians report plans to leave clinical practice within two years, according to the Massachusetts Medical Society. Meanwhile, federal labor projections show PA employment growing by roughly 20 percent over the next decade, reflecting increased reliance on team-based models of care. Health care access in the coming years will depend less on any single profession and more on teams and how effectively states align workforce policy to deliver care.  
From a policy standpoint, the consequences are tangible. Requiring physician assistants to file notice of a single supervising physician can slow recruitment and limit staffing flexibility across sites, particularly in rural hospitals and safety-net settings where adaptability is essential.  
When a supervising physician leaves a practice or health system, that departure can temporarily call into question a PA’s legal authority to practice, even when the PA remains otherwise fully licensed, credentialed, and employed by the institution. This creates regulatory vulnerability tied to personnel changes rather than patient safety and misaligns licensure with how accountability, credentialing, and quality oversight function contemporaneously.  
This misalignment matters, since the new rural health program evaluates whether states have created an optimal practice environment that allows clinicians to practice at the top of their training and be deployed efficiently to meet access needs. States that retain unnecessary supervisory or administrative constraints score lower on workforce and state policy factors that directly affect eligibility for the program’s workload-based funding, which accounts for half of total Rural Health Transformation Program dollars each budget period. 
Massachusetts is close to—but not yet at—the federal definition of “optimal” practice environment. Two pieces of pending legislation before the Legislature could help close that gap.  
One, An Act relative to removing barriers to care for physician assistants, modernizes PA licensure by aligning supervision with contemporary, team-based care models and removing the requirement to file notice of an individual supervising physician as a condition of licensure. 
The second bill, An Act relative to physician assistant interstate compact, authorizes Massachusetts’s participation in the PA Licensure Compact, which would facilitate patient care across state lines.  
Together, these reforms would improve access to care while strengthening the Commonwealth’s competitiveness for future rural health funding rounds, particularly as Medicaid shortfalls will disproportionately affect Massachusetts. The interstate compact also benefits patients seeking care across state lines and in remote regions within our state. In New England’s interconnected health care market, licensure compacts support timely follow-up, coordinated post-discharge care, and continuity when patients receive specialty treatment at Massachusetts’s academic medical centers but return home for ongoing management. 
This is not a debate about deregulation or professional hierarchy. It is a question of whether licensure law reflects contemporary delivery models and the fiscal environment states now face. 
As the Legislature debates primary care reform, the physician assistant modernization bill and the interstate compact legislation should be part of that conversation. With federal health care funding becoming more competitive and increasingly tied to demonstrated policy readiness, PA workforce modernization should be understood for what it is: a strategic legislative decision with real consequences for access, equity, and the Commonwealth’s long-term financial sustainability.

(Photo by Danielle Prokop/Source NM)A drop in immigration amid President Donald Trump’s enforcement crackdown led to historically slow population growth in the United States last year.
Activity at the southern border is at a historic low. The population change reflects the last months of the Biden administration, when immigration controls began to tighten, and the first months of the Trump administration’s massive anti-immigration and deportation agenda.
Five states lost population, according to the new Census Bureau estimates released Jan. 27 covering changes between mid-2024 and mid-2025. The changes suggest Texas and Florida could gain congressional seats at the expense of California, Illinois and New York.
States that did gain population were concentrated in the South, where numbers appear to give Republican states in the region a political edge halfway through the decade. 

 

An analysis by Jonathan Cervas at Carnegie Mellon University predicted four more seats in Congress after the 2030 census for Texas and Florida, with losses of four seats in California and two each in New York and Illinois. Cervas is an assistant teaching professor who researches representation and redistricting. 
“We are still a long way off from 2030, so there is a lot of uncertainty in these projections,” Cervas said, adding that California’s loss in the next decade could be only two or three seats.
Another expert, redistricting consultant Kimball Brace of Virginia, said he was suspicious of the sudden drop in California’s population. Earlier projections had the state losing only one seat after 2030, he said. 
“This acceleration in California’s population loss is not something that was in the projections at all,” Brace said. “I’ve got to be a little bit skeptical in terms of the numbers. It shows a significant difference in what we’ve seen in the early part of the decade.”
Brace was still working on his own analysis. William Frey, a demographer at The Brookings Institution, said net immigration was about 1.3 million nationally for the year, down by more than half from the year before.
Immigration drives nation’s population growth

“As a result most states showed slower growth or greater declines,” Frey said. California had about 200,000 fewer immigrants than the previous year, similar to Texas and New York, though those two states eked out populations gains anyway because of people moving in and births 
Texas and North Carolina gained the most people between mid-2024 and mid-2025, while California and Hawaii lost the most. 
Nationally, the population increased only about 1.7 million, or half a percentage point, to about 341.8 million. It was the lowest increase of the decade and the smallest gain since the pandemic sharply cut growth in 2020 and 2021. Growth was just 1.4 million between mid-2019 and mid-2020, and only about 500,000 between mid-2020 and mid-2021. Before that, national population growth was below 2 million only twice since 1975. 
Among the states, Texas gained about 391,000 in population, up 1.2%, followed in the top 5 by Florida (197,000, or .8%, North Carolina (146,000, or 1.3%), Georgia (99,000, or .9%) and South Carolina (80,000, or 1.5%).
California went from one of the largest increases the previous year to the greatest population loss, about 9,500, less than .1%,  followed by Hawaii (down 2,000, or .1%), Vermont (down 1,900 or 0.3%), New Mexico (down  1,300, or 0.1%) and West Virginia (down 1,300 or .1%). 
Vermont had the largest percentage decrease and South Carolina had the largest increase.

Steve Kolbeck, R-Sioux Falls, testifies on Jan. 27, 2026, to the Senate Commerce and Energy Committee at the South Dakota Capitol in Pierre. (Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota lawmakers advanced a bill Tuesday at the Capitol that would give utilities legal protections if a wildfire is blamed on them, in exchange for filing a wildfire mitigation plan.
The Senate Commerce and Energy Committee voted 6-3 to send the bill to the full Senate.
Under the bill, private utilities could submit mitigation plans to the Public Utilities Commission, while electric cooperatives and municipal utilities could submit plans to their boards or city councils. The utilities that do so would have to file annual compliance reports.
The bill includes required elements for plans, such as identifying higher-risk areas, inspection and operating standards, vegetation management strategies, and coordination with the appropriate wildfire agencies. 
Liability changes
The bill’s most debated section would change the legal playing field after a wildfire. It would bar courts from applying “strict liability” to qualified utilities in wildfire-damage lawsuits. That is a legal standard that makes entities responsible for harm they cause, regardless of whether they were negligent or intended to cause it.
The bill would make the new law a plaintiff’s “sole remedy” against a qualified utility for wildfire losses.
State prepares to get ‘punched in the nose’ as utility plans shut-offs to mitigate wildfire risk

The bill is sponsored by Sen. Steve Kolbeck, R-Sioux Falls, who works as a director of business affairs at Xcel Energy, an investor-owned utility with over 100,000 customers in the state. 
“We want to make people whole. We just don’t want to make them rich,” Kolbeck told fellow members of the committee.
The bill says plaintiffs would be able to recover losses only by proving that the utility failed to “substantially comply” with an “essential element” of the plan, and “that failure was the actual and proximate cause of the damages to the plaintiff.” 
Plaintiffs would have three years to file a lawsuit from the date of ignition.

The bill would also limit noneconomic damages awarded in lawsuits to cases involving death or “visible bodily injury in the form of a burn,” and restrict punitive damages to situations proven by clear and convincing evidence of malice or criminal intent.

Property damages would be capped at the lesser of restoration cost or the change in fair market value before and after the wildfire.

Supporters and opponents
Some utility groups, firefighters, business groups and the state Public Utilities Commission argued the bill would reduce both wildfire risk and utilities’ financial exposure before a catastrophic event, especially in high-risk areas like the Black Hills.
Supporters also said wildfire-related insurance is becoming harder to obtain and more expensive for utilities, and the threat of massive wildfire liability can drive up costs that ultimately land on customers. 
In opposition, insurance industry representatives and trial lawyers argued the bill would give utilities special legal protections not available to other businesses or individuals and shift the cost of wildfire losses from utilities onto property owners and their insurers.










We want to make people whole. We just don’t want to make them rich.


– Sen. Steve Kolbeck, R-Sioux Falls, the sponsor of a bill that would limit electrical providers' wildfire liability


Opponents said the bill effectively replaces a stricter liability standard with a negligence-based framework with additional protections for utilities, and that victims could be left undercompensated due to limits on noneconomic damages, restrictions on punitive damages, and the cap on property recovery. They also raised concerns that the mitigation plan standards are too general and enforcement is too weak.
“Fire victims may not recover non-economic damages unless the plaintiff suffers death or visible body injury in the form of a burn,” said Steve Siegel, representing the South Dakota Trial Lawyers Association. “No smoke inhalation, burned lungs. I’d like to know, what is the definition of ‘visible bodily injury’? Is that with the naked eye? Does that include an MRI scan or a CT scan?”
Siegel said the threat of having to pay damages in lawsuits helps incentivize utilities to mitigate the risk of a fire. 
Power line-related incidents are sources of ignition in the Black Hills. In 2017, the Legion Lake Fire, a wind-driven wildfire that started in Custer State Park, grew rapidly and burned a mix of over 50,000 public and private acres, prompting evacuations and park closures. Investigators concluded the fire was sparked when a tree fell and broke a power line.

(Photo illustration by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A bill that aims to revise restrictions on how Kentucky teachers communicate electronically with their students has passed out of the state Senate. 
The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, builds on her law from last year that required public school teachers and students to electronically communicate only by traceable forms, like emails and school-approved apps, as a way to combat sexual grooming of children. 
 
 SB 181



	However, advocates said the law still had room for improvement, despite its passage by the Republican-controlled General Assembly and signature from Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. Since the law took effect at the start of the current school year, parents and teachers wanted clarification about barring all types of electronic communication, including texts, between students and teachers. Questions arose about what to do when sports teams needed updates from their coaches or students are traveling on field trips and need to be contacted quickly. 
Among the proposed changes in Senate Bill 181: School employees and volunteers may not engage in “unauthorized electronic communication” with students, which is defined as a private message to a student without their parent as a recipient of the message and without parental approval from a consent form. 
Additionally, schools are allowed more discretion when disciplining employees and volunteers for violating the measure. School officials would also be allowed to message a student if they have reason to believe an emergency exists, provided that they disclose the message to a supervisor after the fact. 
Sen. Lindsey Tichenor (LRC Public Information)
The Senate passed the legislation 33-0 Tuesday afternoon. 
While discussing the bill on the floor, Tichenor said she had heard feedback from several survivors of childhood grooming who supported the original intent of the bill.  
“Changes that were made reflect the needs of our districts, but every change I took into consideration was first run by former victims to ensure that the integrity of the bill is upheld,” Tichenor said on the Senate floor. 
The Kentucky Association of School Superintendents (KASS) told the Lantern last year that it supported making changes to the 2025 law. 
Two Republicans, Majority Floor Leader Sen. Max Wise, of Campbellsville, and Sen. Michael Nemes, of Shepherdsville, praised Tichenor for working since last year with teachers, parents and other groups on the latest piece of legislation. 
“The intent is fantastic. It is much needed, and I was glad to see (them) and to tell my constituents and all those school employees and others back home, we are fixing it and it will be corrected, and it is a process,” Wise said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/e591A1026-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 17:58:07.132645

Assembly Republicans proposed Tuesday that Wisconsin match federal policy by putting $1,000 of state funds into savings accounts for newborn babies in Wisconsin during President Donald Trump’s term. 
The federal tax and spending bill signed into law by Trump in July 2025 included a provision that will allow for parents in the U.S. to create “Trump accounts,” which would be an IRA account, for their children. Under the provision, the federal government will provide $1,000 into the account for babies born between Jan. 1, 2025 through the end of 2028 and who are U.S. citizens with a valid Social Security number.
Rep. Elijah Behnke (R-Town of Chase) said that the accounts are “designed to help families build long-term financial security” and allow children to “grow alongside the American economy.” The money in the accounts will be invested in low-cost index funds tied to the U.S stock market, and the accounts will be managed by a private company.
Behnke said “starting early makes a powerful difference” for children who will have the funds set aside, which could be used for down payment on a house, higher education or starting a business in the future. 
“We’re concerned that they’ll never be able to buy a home. Maybe this gives them a chance down the road,” Behnke said. 
The bill will provide a state match of $1,000 to the accounts for babies born in Wisconsin.
Parents must opt in and open the accounts for the funds to be set aside and then invested. Children, parents, family members, friends and employers will also be able to contribute up to $5,000 per year per child to the account with funds unable to be accessed until recipients turn 18. 
The investment account plan is not the only Trump administration policy that Wisconsin Republicans have sought to replicate at the state level this session. Others include exempting tips and overtime pay from the state income tax.
Behnke said lawmakers would tap the state’s budget surplus for the initiative. According to the bill draft, the state would set aside $60 million in annual funding for the 2025-27 budget cycle for this purpose. 
“We have a surplus, thankfully, and it’s over a $1 billion, and obviously we’re discussing some property tax relief, but 60,000 kids [are] estimated to be born in Wisconsin each year, so that would be about $60 million put into account for the next couple years,” Behnke said. 
Recent projections from the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimate that the state’s budget surplus at the end of June 2027 will be $2.37 billion, which is about $1.5 billion above the projected balance when the current state budget was enacted last year. Evers has called for lawmakers to use over $1 billion from the surplus to address rising property taxes throughout the state. Republican lawmakers have signaled some willingness to work on the issue, including Behnke who said that “we’d all be taxed out of our homes if we don’t do something to fix it.” 
Behnke said he did not know where the state Senate and Gov. Tony Evers stand on his proposal. Their support will be necessary for the policy to become a reality. 
“I’ve asked one elected Democrat and he said he would get back to me,” Behnke said. “[Evers has] been very focused on kids’ education, and since we can use this fund for higher education, I mean, I think some of it would be attractive for him to sign.” 
Behnke is also the lead Assembly author on a bipartisan bill that would give children born or adopted in Wisconsin $25 in a state-managed 529 account to help kickstart their educational savings. The bill has bipartisan support and recently received a public hearing in the state Senate last week.
Democratic lawmaker urges caution
One of the Democratic coauthors on that bill, Rep. Alex Joers (D-Waunakee), told the Wisconsin Examiner he recommends caution in pursuing a state match to the “Trump accounts.” He said he thought the effort was a “flashy” one meant to “grab headlines.” 
“It’s a little bit risky to be putting our state funds towards a federal program that isn’t technically set up yet,” Joers said. “We’re basically having to make a dedicated state funding decision based on a federal program that hasn’t begun yet, so that’s to me a little bit fiscally concerning.”
The Trump administration has said that the accounts are supposed to become available on July 4, 2026.
Joers noted that the state has to “balance its ledger,” unlike the federal government, and Wisconsin policymakers are discussing using the budget surplus for property tax relief, boosting aid to schools, funding for child care and other priorities. 
Joers said the “WisKids” bill is designed to be sustainable year after year, meanwhile the “Trump accounts” bill would expire after 2028.
Wisconsin has had a 529 account program for the last 25 years that is primarily managed through Edvest. According to the bill coauthors, there are over 400,000 accounts and assets totaling $8.6 billion under management. 
Parents would need to claim the $25 before their child turns 10, under the legislation. The funds in the account could be used for college, technical education, credential programs or apprenticeships. Withdrawals from a 529 account are tax-free for qualified expenses including tuition, room and board.
“The reality is that most Wisconsin families still aren’t saving early for their child’s education, and many aren’t saving at all,” Behnke said in written testimony about the proposal. “WisKids is designed to change that… We know this approach works. Oklahoma saw a dramatic increase in family-owned 529 accounts after launching a similar program. A small investment at birth encouraged parents to keep saving and gave them a different way of thinking about their child’s future.”
Joers said that calculations show the $25 would potentially grow to be about $100, but the purpose of the bill is to act as a “tap on the shoulder” for parents and guardians to get them interested in starting an Edvest account.
The “WisKids” bill would not need additional state general purpose revenue, but would instead tap into existing funds held by the state Department of Financial Institutions (DFI).
According to a fiscal estimate by the agency, the legislation would use an existing college savings program trust fund, which is funded by administrative fees established by the college savings program board and imposed on college savings program accounts. The state stopped collecting fees on 529 accounts in 2005, but the funds have remained growing in the account and are ready to be used, Joers said.
Under the legislation, the minimum balance of the trust fund that must be maintained to meet the reasonably anticipated needs of the college savings program would have to be calculated and if the trust fund balance falls below that amount, the DFI would stop making deposits until the trust fund balance is sufficient.
“It’s in line with what their program was established for, but they can’t just do that. They need legislation to be able to do that,” Joers said. 
Joers noted that Edvest accounts can be rolled over into a retirement account should the funds not be used for educational purposes.
Promoting the Trump accounts proposal, Behnke said that parents could supplement the account in a way that would be “life-changing.”
“Just with mom and dad, skipping one quick meal, or one small luxury a month — lets their kids become a millionaire,” Behnke said.
“That’s a bipartisan consensus that we want our kids born in Wisconsin to be best set up for the future,” Joers said. But, he cautioned, it’s important to do it in a way that’s “sustainable, and not just going along with the headlines of the day.”

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota legislative leaders have voted to hire outside attorneys to represent them in a new lawsuit over a ballot measure that would change voter-approved legislative term limits.
The suit, filed last week, argues that the Legislature violated the state constitution when it passed a resolution creating the ballot measure last year.
The ballot measure, if approved, would alter the 2022 constitutional amendment that established legislative term limits. But that 2022 amendment contains a provision that specifically says state lawmakers may not propose an amendment to “alter or repeal” those term limits.
Lawsuit accuses North Dakota lawmakers of violating constitution with term limits ballot measure

Believing the resolution to be a violation of that clause, two North Dakotans who organized in support of the 2022 term limits amendment — former Minot lawmaker Sen. Oley Larsen and Grand Forks County commissioner Terry Bjerke — have sued the Legislature and Secretary of State’s Office. They filed the suit directly with the North Dakota Supreme Court.
Legislative Management met Tuesday morning to decide next steps. Most of the meeting was held in an executive session. Under state law, a governing body may close a meeting to the public to discuss legal strategy.
The committee then approved a motion to hire third-party attorneys for the suit, as opposed to being represented by Legislative Council or the North Dakota Attorney General’s Office.
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, called the provision of the 2022 amendment that forbids the statehouse from proposing amendments to legislative term limits a “direct encroachment” on the Legislature’s power. Another part of the state constitution, Article IV, authorizes the Legislature to recommend constitutional amendments to voters.

Hogue said the lawsuit is an opportunity for the North Dakota Supreme Court to weigh in on whether the provision is constitutional. He added that given the gravity of issues at issue in the case, he supports having dedicated attorneys to advocate on the Legislature’s behalf.
Rep. Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks, was the only committee member to vote against the motion. 
Ista said he feels it would be more fiscally prudent not to use outside counsel. He added that the attorneys within Legislative Council or the Attorney General’s Office would do the best job representing the Legislature’s interests, since they have expertise in North Dakota constitutional law.
Ista said he also voted against the resolution during the 2025 season, calling it a “problematic” challenge to the voter-initiated measure. 
He said his gut instinct is that the Supreme Court will agree to hear the case. Even if they do, however, the justices may not find it necessary to rule in a way that clarifies the scope of the Legislature’s power, Ista added.
“It would be my hope that the court will find a way to answer the ultimate question here,” he said.
The 2022 constitutional amendment says state lawmakers can serve no more than eight years in the House and eight years in the Senate.
The ballot measure created by Senate Resolution 4008 seeks to change this so lawmakers can serve up to 16 years in either chamber. It would also specify that partial terms don’t count against term limits.
The measure has been approved for the November election ballot, according to the Secretary of State’s website.
Erika White, the agency’s elections director, said the secretary of state must notify county auditors of what’s on the general election ballot by Sept. 9.

Rep. Don Vigesaa, R-Cooperstown, announced his plans to retire after 23 years of service. He will continue to represent District 29 in central North Dakota until his term ends Nov. 30.
“I’m 73 next month,” Vigesaa said in an interview Tuesday. “I just thought, I’ve got three children and eight grandchildren that are starting to be involved in athletics and music, and we want to be part of their lives and be able to go to those events at any point.”
Vigesaa served as a key lawmaker in crafting the state budget in 2023 and 2025 sessions. His leadership positions also included serving as assistant House majority leader and, more recently, co-leading the Joint Appropriations Committee during the special session that allocated nearly $400 million for state health initiatives over the next two years.
“I just feel like it is time,” he said.
Vigesaa, who owned a car dealership, said his favorite piece of legislation during his career was eliminating a new vehicle rebate from being included in the state’s 5% vehicle excise tax. 
Until that bill passed in 2009, people were paying 5% to the state on rebates they received when buying a new car, he said.
North Dakota rural health plan approved, ‘now we’ve got to implement it’

“I had customers ask me, ‘Now, why do I have to pay tax on the rebate amount?’” Vigesaa said. “Well, I got that fixed.”
House Majority Leader Rep. Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said he breathed a sigh of relief when Vigesaa agreed to become chair of the House Appropriations Committee in 2023 because he was detail-oriented and analytical. Vigesaa served in that role again in the 2025 session.
“When he gets up on the floor and speaks, people have a lot of respect for him and know that he comes from a place of having done his homework and research before he comments,” Lefor said.
Vigesaa was a mentor for Lefor when he began serving in 2015.
“I couldn’t have gotten anyone better,” Lefor said. “He’s just a very sharp man — very high class — and the legislative assembly is certainly going to miss a man of his caliber.”
Vigesaa said he believes anyone wanting to run for legislative office should jump into the process and try it.
“It is a real privilege to deal with the citizens of our state,” he said. “At the end of the day, I’m going to remember some of the legislative process things, but the most lasting memories are going to be the lifelong friendships you develop while you are serving.”

Those rights, scattered throughout Florida statues, would be eliminated, and the Parents’ Bill of Rights expanded, under HB 173, which cleared the House Health and Human Services Committee Tuesday on a partisan 19-7 vote, with a bloc of Democrats opposing the bill.
HB 173 would strike from the state’s family planning statutes language that allows physicians to provide care to a minor if the physicians determine the minor will “suffer probable health hazards if the services are withheld.”
The bill would alter the state’s sexually transmissable disease statutes to eliminate language that allows the DOH, licensed doctors, hospitals, and clinics to treat minors for infections and diseases. It would continue to allow minors to be examined for STIs without parental consent.
The state’s mental health statutes allow minors 13 and older to receive without parental consent crisis intervention services, including individual psychotherapy, group therapy, counseling, or other forms of verbal therapy from licensed mental health professionals or in a licensed mental health facility.
The bill would eliminate that statute and allow minors only to access “immediate, onsite behavioral health crisis services” from mobile response teams.
 Interesting timing
The tandem of proposed changes to family planning services and mental health care were some of those most criticized by members of the public as well as committee members during Tuesday’s hearing on the bill.
The proposed changes come as the rates of STIs in Florida increase and suicide continues to be a leading cause of death for young people.
Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis among 13- to 17-year-olds are the highest they have been since 2008, according to 2023 data from the Florida Department of Health. Those infections can be cured with antibiotics, but worsen if left untreated.
And although Florida’s suicide rate varies by age and demographics, it’s the second or third largest cause of death for people aged 10-34, DOH data show.
Rep. Shane Abbott, R-Defuniak Springs. (Photo via the Florida House of Representatives)
DeFuniak Springs Republican Rep. Shane Abbott, a member of the committee, said that’s precisely why he supports the bill.
“I’ve heard today that we have the highest STI rates in the country doing it the way we’ve been doing it, and now we want to get parents involved. So, maybe as a parent, we can change a behavior. We can prevent a medical outbreak. We can prevent all these health care crises we’re hearing about,” Abbot said.
Rep. Kim Kendall, R-St. Augustine. (Photo/Florida House of Representatives)
HB 173 sponsor Rep. Kim Kendall, a Republican from St. Augustine, seconded Abbott’s line of thinking.
“I agree with Rep. Abbott, we’ve been hearing that suicide rates are up, STD cases are up. Let’s give it a shot to put the parents back into the medical welfare of the child,” she said.
 What about crisis lines?

Kendall assured committee member Robin Bartleman that she’d “check on the suicide crisis line” and whether HB 173 as written would ban minors from being able to tap into the 988 Suicide & Crisis hotline or Florida 211, a free resource that connects people with services and resources from food and housing to utilities payment assistance and mental health crisis care.
Bartleman, a Democrat from Weston, said she didn’t see any language in HB 173 that ensured minors continued access to the hotlines.
“I can tell you right now, if my teen is about to kill themselves, I want them to access a hotline,” she said, telling Kendall that she flagged the same concerns with a similar bill last year.
Kendall, whose brother committed suicide, defended the changes in the bill.
“You can’t take away the most important thing, which is the vast majority of parents. No medical professional is going to wrap that child in their love and be around 24/7, whether it’s a logical thing like, ‘Oops, don’t take that ibuprofen,’ to, ‘I care about you. You mean something.’ That is critical,” she said.
She added: “I will put my bottom dollar on that, that those numbers (STI infections and suicide rates) go down.”
The bill would require local school boards to provide parents of schoolchildren grades K-12 with a copy — either electronic or paper — of any well-being, mental health, or health screening questionnaire or form to be given to kids. School boards also would be required to provide parents with the dates and times when questionnaires will be administered.
Florida law already requires school boards to provide the parents with the questionnaires and to allow parents to exempt their children. But the law applies only to children in grades K-3. HB 173 would require the notice be given to parents of all students K-12. It also would specifically add “mental health” to the type of questionnaires parents must be informed of in advance.

 Beefing up the Parents’ Bill of Rights

In addition to striking several statutes from the books, the bill would amend the Parents’ Bill of Rights, to make clear that parents’ rights are limited only if, among other things:
•The parent is the subject of an investigation into a crime against the minor child;
•The minor child is in out-of-home placement by the Department of Children and Families;
•The parent cannot be located and another person authorized to make health care decisions is available to consent; or
•The minor child is receiving emergency medical treatment that if delayed would endanger the health or physical well-being of the minor or is receiving onsite behavioral health crisis care from a mobile response team.
Sen. Erin Grall is sponsoring the companion bill, SB 166, which is identical. It has been referred to the Senate Education Pre-K-12, Health Policy, and Rules committees but has yet to be heard.
More than 30 lobbyist have registered on HB 173 from such disparate interests as the Florida Chapter of American Academy of Pediatrics, local school boards, and the Council of Florida Medical School Deans, a group that represents the state’s public and private allopathic and osteopathic medical schools.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, in an executive order Tuesday, directed state officials to protect foster youths’ earned survivor benefits under the U.S. Social Security Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and U.S. Railroad Retirement Board.

U.S. Assistant HHS Secretary Alex Adams, head of the department’s Administration for Children and Families, joined the Nebraska executive order signing Tuesday and commended Pillen. Adams has described the long-standing practice as an “orphan tax.”
Adams said Pillen demonstrated “moral clarity” in wanting to do right by children.
“We’ve seen other states lacing up their shoes to respond,” Adams told the Nebraska Examiner. “Nebraska took quick, executive, decisive action to protect the most vulnerable youth in its state. It doesn’t go unnoticed.”
Nebraska DHHS retained $1.4 million to cover costs of care in the most recent fiscal year. An agency spokesperson said DHHS has approximately 128 children who are state wards and have at least one parent who is deceased and are receiving the death benefits.
‘Everything to those kids’
Adams said someone brought the issue to him in Idaho, describing it as a problem that, at first glance, “sounds so cynical that you’re like, there’s no way that that’s happening.”
He said the money could be used for college or a first home or apartment and that some states had rationalized the spending as taking on parental costs. However, Adams said it didn’t make sense for orphans to pay for their own care using the last money from their parents while the state covered the costs for others.

Adams said Idaho’s total health department budget while he was agency head, and when the practice occurred, was about $5.5 billion. He said the department diverted about $500,000 in survivor benefits from about 250 youths in foster care.
“It was budget dust to the state, but it meant everything to those kids,” Adams said, who moved to end the practice.
Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services CEO Steve Corsi said it’s not quite “budget dust” in Nebraska, but “we can figure that out.”
“Sometimes, the right thing to do has a little cost that goes with it,” Corsi said. “And this is one of those.”
‘The right thing to do’
Corsi said the money will now go into trust accounts for the foster care youths’ futures. DHHS will also provide them with financial literacy education, no later than age 14, to help manage their funds.
Adams and Corsi, in an interview with the Examiner on Tuesday, described the partnership as fast-moving after the Dec. 11 letter. The two leaders had a previous relationship as state-level cabinet members. 
Adams previously led Idaho’s health agency. 
Corsi said he told Adams that he would need to talk to Pillen first. It was “literally a walk down the hall” in the Capitol, Corsi said, and Pillen responded, “Steve, we need to fix that. How fast can we get that fixed?”
Echoing comments Corsi said he’d heard from Pillen and Adams, Corsi asked, “How dare we take away the last positive gift or benefit that deceased parents can offer their child?”
“How dare we as a government do that?” Corsi said.

After getting his appointment from President Donald Trump last year, Adams said he wanted to take the lead on the issue at the federal level. He said Trump and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., shared his concerns and let Adams lead.
“At HHS, our guiding principle is simple: every child deserves a home and a fair chance to thrive. But when state agencies stack the deck against children, we step in,” Kennedy said in December. “We are committed to ensuring every child in America has the chance to reach their full potential.”
Order takes effect immediately
Once letters went out, Adams said many states didn’t know, which he credited in part to turnover at state HHS agencies and of governors nationwide.
“Oftentimes this is just one of those things running in the background that people are doing that they’re not stopping to ask, ‘Should we be doing that?’” Adams said.

The Nebraska executive order bars DHHS from using any survivor benefits to reimburse itself or contractors for the costs of a child’s care or maintenance while in state custody. Under current state law, DHHS could retain amounts over $1,000 in Social Security benefits a child receives.
“It is in the best interest of children who are eligible for such federal survivor benefits that those funds be conserved, used for unmet needs and made available to them as they transition to adulthood,” the executive order states.
Pillen ordered the changes to take effect immediately and mandated full compliance “as soon as practicable.”
“Executive state agencies shall cooperate in the implementation of this order to the fullest extent possible under Nebraska law,” the executive order states.
Pillen said in a statement that safeguarding the benefits “recognizes both the child’s right to these funds and our obligation to act in their best interest. Protecting these resources helps ensure youth in our care have greater stability as they prepare for independence.”
‘Long time coming’
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha had worked since 2021 to help foster children retain more of their Social Security benefits. She passed a 2025 bill to require DHHS to screen state wards for eligibility, hold their benefits in trust accounts separate from state agency funds and provide more transparency on the use of such funds.
The 2025 bill originally would have helped foster youths keep more benefits, but with state financial pressures, Hunt worked with advocates and other senators to have an impact without as much cost at the time.

Of the new executive order, Hunt said in a text: “Very exciting!”
“Long time coming,” Hunt added. “Glad it’s done.”
Speaker John Arch of La Vista, a former chair of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, had worked with Hunt. He said he was also in favor of the state-level order.
Adams said other states have started the legislative process to respond, such as Mississippi and Utah, but he encouraged other states to follow Nebraska’s lead.
Corsi said he couldn’t comment on whether Nebraska might pursue legislation to put the executive order into statute without first talking to Pillen’s team. But he noted the order carries the weight of law.
“You don’t need to wait for the Legislature,” Adams said. “A strong leader who has moral conviction can do this today. Every governor has the power to do this today.”

The state has begun funding pop-up shelters in four additional locations this year, a formidable effort that materializes and evaporates based on the weather.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
BURLINGTON – Sarah Russell steered the shuttle bus into the grocery store parking lot where, a few minutes before, a stranger had called to alert her that a man lay huddled against the building in a nest of sleeping bags. 
Temperatures were quickly sliding and a harsh wind howled. The night of Friday, Jan. 23 was shaping up to be among the coldest yet of the winter. Russell, emergency services director for the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, was spending the evening hours driving around Burlington and asking unhoused people if they had a place to sleep inside. If they didn’t, she offered them a seat aboard the shuttle and a bed at the city’s extreme cold weather shelter, which Russell and a small army of service providers working overtime hours open up when feels-like temperatures drop to -10 degrees.

About 60 people had already arrived at the shelter, and Russell expected the numbers to keep climbing. People had come from as far away as Middlebury and St. Johnsbury for a cot inside the community center gym, she said.
As high rates of homelessness in Vermont have persisted since the pandemic years – and state leaders have scaled back the state’s primary mode of cold-weather aid, the motel voucher program – extreme cold shelters like this one have become an increasingly crucial piece of Vermont’s response.
In prior years, just Burlington and Rutland have operated cold-weather emergency shelters paid for by the state. This winter, state officials have directed funding toward more sites and are now footing the bill for pop-up shelters in Bennington, Brattleboro, Montpelier and Newport, too. (Other, more informal cold weather shelters sometimes operate elsewhere, too).
The aim of these extreme cold shelters is to keep people alive amid bitter cold. Their expansion by the state is an implicit acknowledgement that a growing number of people experiencing homelessness in Vermont are living outside during the depths of winter. And the formidable effort it takes to open them within a few days’ notice can feel futile when temperatures inch above the state’s strict threshold and shelter guests are sent back out into the elements.

Russell pulled the shuttle bus against the curb of the Shelburne Road grocery store and approached the man in the sleeping bags. His hands were bare and raw. He explained that he had been staying at a nearby hotel with a friend before the friend had been admitted to the hospital a day prior. The people who saw him propped against the wall of Market 32 didn’t know him but, concerned for his life, found Russell’s phone number and called for help.
Russell helped gather the man’s blankets and food from a shopping cart and directed him into the bus.
“Here, you come on inside,” she said.
A herculean effort
Operating these ephemeral shelters requires a herculean amount of effort each night they run.
Ahead of this winter, state officials set aside about $1 million to expand the state’s network of extreme cold weather shelters. The advocacy group Vermont Interfaith Action is administering the grant funding to six local nonprofits and municipalities, which operate about 200 beds total.

The local shelters are triggered for “mandatory” activation when windchill temperatures drop to a sustained -10 degrees, though they can choose to operate when temperatures fall below 0. That trigger is looser than the -20 degree threshold the state had used in seasons past.
The state decided to bulk up the emergency shelter effort this winter in part because of the wind-down of the COVID-era motel voucher program, said Lily Sojourner, director of the Office of Economic Opportunity within the Department for Children and Families. The state had also witnessed a decrease in winter-long seasonal shelter beds during the pandemic and the years afterward, when volunteers stayed away because of health concerns, she added. 
Ahead of this season, Sojourner and her team forecast that volunteer interest had rebounded enough to make more extreme cold shelters viable. These temporary shelter efforts supplement her office’s push to create more seasonal and year-round shelter beds, she said.
Even so, some of the smaller extreme cold shelters that rely on volunteers have struggled to fill shifts. In Montpelier, shelter coordinator Andrea Stander said she has been brainstorming new ways to underscore the urgency of the shelter effort each time she blasts an email out to volunteers, trying to get them to agree to work overnight hours on a quick turnaround.

“It’s a little nerve-wracking, because we can’t open if we don’t have all the volunteers covered,” she said.
In Bennington, the extreme cold shelter did not open during a cold snap that occurred over Christmas because staff members were out of town, according to Roxanne Carelli, executive director of operational development and shelter services at Bennington County Coalition for the Homeless.
Space has proven another hurdle for some shelters. In Brattleboro, a shelter at a local church secured a waiver from the state Division of Fire Safety to host 15 guests on nights when temperatures fall below zero. The shelter has raised local funding to remain open on warmer nights, too, but on those nights the state has cleared them to have only eight beds.
“What really sucks is when we have a night with 15 beds, and then the very next night, we go back to eight beds, and it’s only a couple degrees warmer outside,” said Cristina Shayonye, the shelter director. “I have to tell half of the people who show up that the state of Vermont thinks it’s safer for them to sleep outside than it is for them to sleep in the same beds they slept in last night.”
Getting the word out that the shelters are open is its own project. In Montpelier, Stander built a simple website that indicates whether or not the shelter is open each day. Other locations post updates on Facebook or tell guests to call 2-1-1.
But for people without access to the internet or a phone, “it’s really just walking by at 8 o’clock at night and seeing if there’s lights on,” said Casey Winterson, director of economic and community based services at Northeast Kingdom Community Action, which runs the shelter in Newport. “Which is certainly challenging … if you’re cold and have nowhere to go.”

Disaster mode
Setting up cots on Friday afternoon, Russell said she often hears from people who want to see the Burlington extreme cold weather shelter open all the time. But this model more closely resembles a response to a flood than to an ongoing need, she said.
Run by paid staff and not volunteers, opening the shelter requires Russell and much of her staff to shift into triage mode. Ahead of the shelter’s opening, one CVOEO employee picked up 200 blankets from the University of Vermont Medical Center. Another cooked enough meals to feed the shelter guests for four nights, the amount of time the Burlington shelter planned to be open amid an arctic blast and subsequent blizzard. 
Others gathered spare clothes, hand warmers, and overdose-reversing medication. Russell filled 70 overtime shifts with nonprofit staff, and fielded constant calls from people seeking a warm place to sleep. The late-hour shuttle runs were the last task in a days-long sprint of preparation.
“We can’t continue to rely on a disaster response over a sustained period of time – it’s just not sustainable,” Russell said. “If we had enough shelter capacity, we would never need to open this.”
In at least one mark of success, Vermont Public/VTDigger could not identify any reported deaths of people experiencing homelessness during the recent cold snap. Yet the existence of the cold weather shelters alone has not prevented deaths this season: One man, Richard Govea, died in December in Barre on a night when the network of shelters was running. 
By Tuesday, when temperatures rose slightly, Russell’s team began to shut the shelter down. Looking at the forecast, she planned to reopen two days later – and begin the process over again.

,California,2026-01-27 22:20:33+00:00,CalMatters,Los Angeles won’t be tweaking its ‘mansion tax.’ Now the debate is likely to go statewide,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2026/01/measure-ula-raman-dead/,The ballot measure do-over was intended to ward off a statewide anti-tax crusade.,"In summary
The ballot measure do-over was intended to ward off a statewide anti-tax crusade.


Los Angeles will be keeping its controversial “mansion tax” just the way it is, thank you very much.
On Tuesday morning, L.A.’s city council rejected an eleventh hour proposal to place a re-write of the city’s four-year-old tax on high value real estate sales onto the June 2026 local ballot. 
The decision, made after a heated session brimming with arcane procedural objections and spirited public comment from tenant activists and union members, effectively quashes the hopes of real estate developers, commercial landlords and a growing caucus of housing construction advocates and Democratic state elected officials who see the highest-in-the-state transfer fee as both an investment killer and an urgent political liability — both in Los Angeles and across California.
A sizable majority of the city’s voters approved the tax, known as Measure ULA, in 2022. It places a 4% tax on property sales between $5 million and $10 million and a 5.5% tax on transactions above that. So far, the tax has raised more than $1 billion in revenue dedicated for affordable housing development and support for cash-strapped renters. 
Any changes to the tax would require sign off from the electorate, which today’s vote ensures won’t come anytime soon. It also kicks a broader multibillion dollar debate over fees on property sales to state lawmakers. 
Hanging over the debate is the specter of a proposed statewide proposition that would sharply cap municipal transfer taxes, while also restricting other local taxes. That campaign is being organized by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which campaigns for lower taxes, and is racing to gather signatures ahead of a late February deadline. If it qualifies, it would appear on the November 2026 ballot.
A growing caucus of Democrats and their political allies argue that local opposition to ULA has juiced political support for that more far-reaching anti-tax prop, one they see as a fiscal disaster.
Should a statewide anti-tax proposition qualify, many believe that lawmakers will be forced to offer up concessions, in the form of broader statewide restriction on transfer taxes, to convince the backers of the Howard Jarvis measure to remove it from the ballot. That might include the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association itself, or perhaps The California Business Roundtable, a major business coalition that has ponied up most of the funding for the campaign so far.
Such grand bargains between state legislators and ballot measure backers are relatively common fare in the California capitol in the months leading up to an election.
Councilmember Nithya Raman, author of the motion, alluded to that possible outcome as she implored her colleagues to put the local measure on the ballot.
“There are real threats to ULA from statewide ballot initiatives that threaten to take away transfer taxes entirely across California, from planned legislative action in Sacramento and from local ballot initiatives, all of which are likely to make far deeper cuts to ULA’s revenues,” she said.
Raman also noted that the measure, which she backed in 2022, has resulted in economically and politically disastrous “unintended consequences.”
“Voters were sold a ‘mansion tax’ and ignoring the very real impacts on apartment construction — apartments that people want and need and want to move into — doesn’t protect Measure ULA, it weakens it,” she said. 
Because the transfer tax doesn’t distinguish between what types of developments are subject to the tax, it has also fallen upon large apartment, mixed-used and commercial projects along with actual mansions. In the years since, apartment sales have declined significantly within the city compared to surrounding municipalities that do not have the tax. 
The tax’s defenders counter that claims of a Los Angeles real estate market implosion are overblown. Building permits, citywide, increased by 60% between the fall of 2024 and the fall of 2025, according to data analyzed by United to House LA, a coalition of unions, affordable housing developers and private development skeptics.
Jesse Zwick, regional director of the Housing Action Coalition, a pro-development advocacy group that backed the measure, and a Santa Monica councilmember, called that claim “disingenuous,” noting that 2024 represents an historic lowpoint for permits.
“Even a dead cat bounces,” he said. “If you look at L.A. vis-à-vis other cities in L.A. county, we are still deeply in deficit.”
Raman’s proposed ballot tweak would have exempted new apartments, condos, commercial and mixed-used projects from the transfer tax for the first 15 years after construction in effort to reduce the financial penalty on new development. State housing regulators have tasked the city with planning for an additional 456,643 new units through 2029 to make up for a chronic deficit. 
The measure would have also exempted households affected by natural disasters, such as the Palisades and Eaton fires, and reduced some of the restrictions on how revenue generated by the tax can be used for affordable housing developments.
Defenders of the current tax decried the proposal, which was introduced on Friday, as rushed and poorly considered. 
“This motion represents tens of millions, if not over a hundred million dollars, in cuts to ULA revenue for homelessness prevention programs and affordable housing solutions,” said Joe Donlin, director of United to House LA.
He also dismissed the idea that the city should preemptively rewrite its transfer tax to head off the Howard Jarvis-backed initiative. “There have been many boogymen trotted out to try to scare the public into giving tax breaks for developers,” he said.
Technically, the L.A. council did not kill the measure outright, but referred it to further debate in committee. But with the June primary ballot deadline rapidly approaching, the delay likely nixes the possibility of the city amending its own tax before a possible statewide measure goes before voters.
“It seems unlikely there will be more action on this issue locally this year,” said Zwick. Between the broader effort to severely cap transfer taxes by anti-tax advocates and the current policy’s supporters, he called Raman’s proposed fix “the best political compromise” that could be achieved this year “absent increased leverage through the statewide tax measures.”
If the statewide tax measure does ultimately become law, it would cost cities between $2 billion and $3 billion each year, according to an analysis commissioned by the League of California Cities, a lobbying group. 
If and when it qualifies, that may trigger a fresh round of negotiations over state transfer tax policy, said Mott Smith, a commercial developer and board member of the California Infill Builders Association. 
“Right now the argument for transfer tax reform is that Measure ULA isn’t working as promised — which, by the way, is a very good argument,” he said. “But once the Howard Jarvis initiative qualifies, and it looks like it probably will, it becomes a conversation about how we preserve $3 billion of local revenue across the state.”
Asked about the signature gathering effort, Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, merely said that he was “cautiously optimistic.” As for a broader deal, should the measure qualify, he insisted that he was solely focused on his own measure for now.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/080719_LosAngeles_AW_CM_63.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-27 17:58:07.132645

(Photo by David Wren/South Carolina Gazette)—NORTH CHARLESTON — Boeing Co. is stabilizing production at its 787 Dreamliner plant here, both in numbers and quality, even as it embarks on a $1 billion plan to expand the site’s manufacturing capacity.
Kelly Ortberg, Boeing’s president and CEO, said Tuesday the aerospace giant is building eight 787 wide-body jets per month — up from five a year ago — and will increase production to 10 per month over the next year.
Increases beyond that will take place at a second assembly building under construction at Boeing’s campus off International Boulevard. That project, which will add 1,000 jobs to the plant’s workforce of more than 8,200 people, broke ground in November and is scheduled for completion in 2027.
“I’m pleased with the operational metrics we’re seeing in the (Dreamliner) factory,” Ortberg said during an earnings call with analysts.
Boeing beat Wall Street’s financial expectations, prompting Ortberg to say the aerospace firm is making progress toward returning “to the iconic company we all know it can be” following years of production problems and the 737 Max scandal.
In addition to making more 787s, the factory off International Boulevard is clamping down on mistakes.
Ortberg said the plane-maker reduced the average number of rework hours – the time it takes to fix manufacturing errors once a jet has left final assembly — by nearly 30% in 2025. Rework issues have been a persistent problem for the Dreamliner program over the years, eating into profitability.
“Going forward … we’ll use the same disciplined processes, including monitoring our KPIs (key performance indicators), to assess readiness for the next planned rate increase to 10 airplanes per month, which is also targeted for later this year.” Ortberg said.
Boeing is coming off a year in which it delivered 88 Lowcountry-built Dreamliners to customers. Jay Malave, the company’s chief financial officer, said deliveries of the wide-body jet will total between 90 and 100 this year.
“Overall, we expect (commercial airplane) deliveries to be up close to 10%” across all of Boeing’s single-aisle and wide-body programs, he said during the earnings call.
Airlines worldwide will need more than 7,800 wide-body jets like the Dreamliner over the next two decades, both for fleet additions and to replace aging planes, according to Boeing’s latest commercial market outlook.

That would be an 89.5% increase in the number of those big jets in global fleets.
“We continue to see strong demand for the 787 Dreamliner family and its market-leading efficiency and versatility,” Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a written statement during the plant expansion’s groundbreaking.
The Dreamliner factory update came as Boeing reported earnings that far outpaced analysts’ expectations.
Boeing said it had fourth-quarter revenues of $9.92 per share on sales totaling $23.9 billion – a 57% increase from the same period a year ago. Wall Street was expecting a 44 cents-per-share loss on sales of $22.6 billion.
Net income totaled $8.22 billion in the fourth quarter, up from a nearly $4 billion loss a year ago.
The fourth-quarter numbers were helped by Boeing’s sale of its Digital Aviation Solutions business. Not counting that sale, Boeing would have lost about $2 per share during the quarter.

,DC,2026-01-27 22:14:36+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Homeland Security boss Noem in hot water after response to Minneapolis killings,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/homeland-security-boss-noem-hot-water-after-response-minneapolis-killings,,"WASHINGTON — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is facing mounting criticism, including from some congressional Republicans and moderate Democrats, for her response to a second killing by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis.President Donald Trump reiterated his confidence in Noem Tuesday, but several Republican senators, a group that overwhelmingly voted last year for Noem to lead the Department of Homeland Security, are pushing for an independent investigation into the Saturday killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents and calling for her to testify before Congress.And Democrats who are generally not among their party’s most aggressive members in opposing the Trump administration have joined a call to impeach Noem and restrict her department’s funding.Trump told reporters, though, that the former South Dakota governor had done a good job, especially on controlling border crossings.“No,” he said, when asked if she would step down, according to White House pool reports. He made a similar statement to Fox News’ Will Cain during an afternoon appearance in Iowa. “She was there with the border,” he told Cain. “Who closed up the border? She did.” GOP calls for investigationThe calls for an independent investigation signaled something of a loss of confidence in Noem from some Republicans in the wake of missteps following Pretti’s killing. No Republican senators voted against her confirmation last year.Kentucky Republican Rand Paul, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, criticized Noem Tuesday for not placing the agents involved in shooting Pretti on administrative leave.“That should happen immediately,"" Paul wrote on social media Tuesday, adding that “for calm to be restored” an independent investigation needs to happen.Within hours of Saturday’s shooting Noem labeled Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, as a “domestic terrorist” who intended “to inflict maximum damage on individuals and kill law enforcement.”Noem used similar terminology after federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7. Both Good and Pretti’s shootings were widely caught on camera, contradicting claims by Noem that both posed a threat.

Multiple videos show that Good was driving away when Ross fired three shots into her windshield. Video analysis by the New York Times shows Pretti wrestled to the ground by multiple agents and, while pinned down, two officers fired 10 shots. The analysis also showed that an officer took away a handgun from Pretti, which he had a permit for, while he was pinned down.The contradictions hurt Noem’s standing with some Republicans.“I can’t recall ever hearing a police chief immediately describing the victim as a “domestic terrorist” or a “would-be assassin,’” Paul said, taking aim at Noem as well as White House senior advisor Stephen Miller, who called Pretti a “would-be assassin.”HearingsNoem also said that because Pretti had a handgun, he inherently posed a danger to DHS agents, a claim that has divided Republicans.Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho took issue with Noem’s criticism of Pretti’s possession of a gun. “His family, law-abiding citizens exercising their Second Amendment right and the trust of the American people deserve a fair process,” he said on social media Monday.Sen. John Curtis, Republican of Utah, criticized Noem for her handling of Saturday’s shooting.“Officials who rush to judgment before all the facts are known undermine public trust and the law-enforcement mission,” he wrote on social media Monday. “I disagree with Secretary Noem’s premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence.”He also called for an independent investigation. Paul on Monday called for several leaders of agencies within Homeland Security to testify before his committee – U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.Those same agency leaders are scheduled to appear before the House Committee on Homeland Security on Feb. 10.Dems ramp up impeachment talkDemocrats are calling for Noem’s removal, along with pushing for changes to the Homeland Security funding bill, increasing the chances of a partial government shutdown at midnight Friday. In the House, 162 Democrats had co-sponsored articles of impeachment against Noem by Tuesday afternoon, a number that climbed throughout the day. The articles were first introduced shortly after Good’s death.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other House Democratic leaders issued a joint statement Monday calling for Noem to be fired. If she’s not, Democrats would move forward with impeachment, the leaders said. The effort is unlikely to move in the House-controlled GOP.“Dramatic changes at the Department of Homeland Security are needed,” Jeffries said. “Federal agents who have broken the law must be criminally prosecuted. The paramilitary tactics must cease and desist.”Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, called for Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio to begin impeachment proceedings into Noem, noting that masked agents of her department “brutally killed two American citizens.” “Far from condemning these unlawful and savage killings in cold blood, Secretary Noem immediately labeled Renée and Alex ‘domestic terrorists,’ blatantly lied about the circumstances of the shootings that took their lives, and attempted to cover-up and blockade any legitimate investigation into their deaths,” Raskin said.On Tuesday, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a moderate Democrat who voted to confirm Noem, made a direct appeal to Trump to fire her.“Americans have died,” Fetterman said in a statement. “She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy.”Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen, another moderate Democrat, also called for Noem to be impeached.Trump pivotsFacing mounting pressure, Trump has softened his tone with state and local officials and walked back his administration's aggressive immigration operations in Minnesota that Noem has overseen.  Trump directed border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to take over ICE operations, effectively sidelining Noem, who in December deployed 3,000 federal immigration officers to the state after right-wing media influencers resurfaced reports of fraud in the state’s social service programs. By Monday evening, top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino was removed from his position as at-large commander and sent back to California, according to multiple media reports. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the decision to send Homan to Minnesota, arguing that Noem is occupied with managing FEMA operations as a winter storm covers much of the country. Funding billIn the wake of Saturday’s shooting, Senate Democrats quickly opposed the Homeland Security spending bill the chamber was set to pass this week. Instead, Democrats argued the measure must be stripped from the government funding package of six bills and renegotiated to include more constraints on federal immigration enforcement.The funding package passed the House this month, but a majority of Democrats opposed any funding for ICE, which would maintain a flat funding level of $10 billion. Even if there is a partial government shutdown, DHS still has up to $190 billion it can spend from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the president’s signature tax and spending cuts package signed into law last summer.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2026-01-27 17:58:07.132645

Wes Moore unveiled a legislative energy proposal Tuesday that aims to deliver another $40 electric bill refund to Marylanders, along with policy changes focused on modernizing transmission lines and bolstering clean power in the state.","Gov. Wes Moore (D), shown here in a file photo from last week, said the energy proposal he unveiled Tuesday is aims to ""deliver real relief"" by driving down utility bills and investing in projects that make energy ""more reliable and affordable.” (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) unveiled a legislative energy proposal Tuesday that aims to deliver another roughly $40 electric bill refund to Marylanders, along with policy changes focused on modernizing transmission lines and bolstering clean power in the state.
Moore’s plan would pull about $725 million from a state renewable energy fund — which is fueled by the utilities, and, in turn, ratepayers. The largest part of that, $292 million, would be used to help close a $1.5 billion shortfall in the fiscal 2027 budget, and the rest would be divided among a number of energy and environmental programs.
That plan would leave about $164 million in the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, or SEIF, which has grown explosively in recent years as utilities have opted to pay into the fund rather than paying for the increasing amounts of renewable energy projects required by law.
Moore’s bill, the Lower Bills and Local Power Act, would direct $100 million from the SEIF to Maryland’s residential ratepayers, similar to a $200 million disbursement last year that sent one refund to utility customers over the summer, with a second coming soon. The payments are based on a household’s energy usage, but they average about $40.
“Our administration is stepping up to deliver real relief, focusing on driving down the cost of utility bills for Marylanders, and investing in local projects that make energy more reliable and affordable,” Moore wrote in a statement.
Moore’s proposal would also end a practice that has cost Maryland ratepayers an estimated $20 to $25 million each year. Under current law, Maryland utilities can charge ratepayers for being a part of the regional transmission grid, PJM Interconnection. The governor’s bill would require utilities to stay on the PJM grid, but would not allow them to bill ratepayers.
Moore, other PJM governors push for changes at the nation’s biggest electric grid

“This is a very common practice, and we are just ultimately removing that incentive and telling utility companies this is something you ought to do,” said Saif Ratul, a deputy legislative officer for Moore. “Maryland ratepayers are not paying you additional incentive at a time when you’re making a record … profit to do something that you’re already doing.”
That provision got support from Emily Scarr, a senior adviser at the Maryland Public Interest Research Group.
“In the face of rapidly rising utility bills, our state leaders need to scrutinize every cost that is being charged to ratepayers,” Scarr said in a statement Tuesday. “Gov. Moore’s proposal to require utility participation in regional grid planning and management will save Maryland utility customers $20 million a year.”
Republicans argued that the SEIF has ballooned because of Maryland’s renewable energy requirements, and that using it to help correct the state’s deficit or complete other programs is disingenuous.
“Marylanders are overpaying because of Democratic mandates, and instead of giving that money back or fixing the policies that caused the problem, the Governor is using it to fund government operations,” Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore) said in a statement Tuesday. “That is not energy relief — it’s a shell game.”
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said his chamber will carefully scrutinize the funding pulled out of the SEIF “to make sure that those programs are as effective and the highest and best value for ratepayers.”
“We know that we need to generate more energy. Having lots of little, tiny programs that are all over the map may not be the best way to approach it, instead of being targeted with a larger investment that will get more electricity on the grid,” he said.
But Ferguson said he supports returning some of the funds to ratepayers.
“We’re trying to give immediate relief where we can with refunds and rebates,” Ferguson said. “I think you will see more coming out of the Senate to provide additional short-term relief.”

– Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore), on the governor's proposed energy legislation


The bill also promises to fast-track permitting for upgrades to existing power transmission lines — rather than building entirely new ones.
“One, we don’t want to be unnecessarily building in new places,” said Ryan Opsal, director of energy policy at the Maryland Energy Administration. “And two, any time anything gets built by any type of utility, it goes in their rate base and they make money on it over the long term.”
Expedited consideration by the Maryland Public Service Commission of construction permits for utilities that decide to complete upgrades or grid enhancements “is the carrot for developers,” Ratul said.
It comes as one power line proposal in particular has stirred a significant pushback: The proposed Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, currently before the PSC, would travel 67 miles through Central Maryland. Opponents say it would disturb a large amount of farmland and natural areas, and alternative grid improvements should have been considered instead.
Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Carroll and Frederick), who represents two of the counties where the power line would run, criticized the governor’s focus on power transmission in the bill, arguing the state should focus on natural gas fired power plants.
“This plan makes it clear that Maryland is being turned into a transmission state, not a generation state,” Ready said in a statement Tuesday. “The Governor is spending money ratepayers have already paid to upgrade transmission lines so we can import electricity from Pennsylvania, rather than producing reliable power here at home.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Moore would also set aside $10 million from the SEIF for the Department of Transportation to evaluate opportunities for transmission lines and battery storage projects on state highway land. It follows a Moore executive order in December directing the department to investigate the matter.
“By leveraging existing state’s highway right-of-way, Maryland can bypass complex land acquisition and permitting processes, which will rapidly deploy the high-voltage capacity necessary to improve grid reliability across the state,” Moore’s office said in a news release Tuesday.
Moore’s plan would pull about $70 million from the SEIF for gap financing for  “shovel-ready” solar and battery storage projects, a response to the elimination of federal tax credits for solar projects under President Donald Trump’s (R) One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, the governor’s news release said.
Ratul said the “goal is not to provide financial certainty for the businesses to stay afloat. The goal really, here, is to provide financial services so that the projects are coming online as quickly as possible.”
Some environmental groups have expressed concern about Moore’s decision to pull so much money from the SEIF for unrelated purposes, such as fixing the state’s budget woes. But they applauded Moore’s decision to bolster solar and storage with the money.
“By financing shovel-ready solar plus storage projects, this legislation ensures utility accountability and prioritizes the most cost-effective, rapidly deployable energy sources making energy more affordable for all Marylanders,” League of Conservation Voters Maryland Executive Director Kim Coble said in a statement.

Lawmakers are seeking $2 million dollars for the New Mexico Agricultural Department to continue a now defunct federal program that purchased food from local farmers for New Mexico foodbanks. (Josh Bachman/NMSU)Legislation that would restore a federal farm-to-foodbank program advanced Tuesday morning through the New Mexico Legislature’s House Agriculture, Acequia and Water Resources Committee, along with a bill to hike fines for stealing water and funding for statewide water projects.
The committee unanimously passed House Bill 101, sponsored by Rep. Joanne Ferrary (D-Las Cruces), which would provide $2 million for the New Mexico Department of Agriculture to resurrect a now-defunct federal program that purchased food from local farmers and ranchers to provide to food banks that feed hungry New Mexicans. The bill would go into effect immediately upon signing because of its emergency clause, so funding would be available for purchasing in the summer and fall, said Ferrary. ​
Farmers, food banks decry program loss

The bill originally requested $200 million, but that was a typo, Ferray told the committee.
“It strengthens New Mexico’s local and regional food systems by focusing on in-state producers, with a focus on small to mid-sized farmers,” Ferrary said. “All purchases will be made within New Mexico, ensuring that investments will remain local while expanding food access for underserved communities.”
Over three years, the federal program accounted for $4.5 million in purchases to local farmers and food was distributed in all 33 counties, said Bonnie Murphy, the manager for the regional Farm to Foodbank program.
The bill would require a line-item in the budget in order to go into effect. While the executive budget requested the $2 million for a farm-to-foodbank program, the Legislative Finance Committee did not include it in its proposed budget.
Rep. Susan Herrera (D-Embudo), who sits on the House Appropriations and Finance Committee as well, said that the program was “flagged in the committee’s recommendation” and would likely be put into the budget over the weekend.
The committee also passed in an 8-1 vote House Bill 111, which gives state water authorities the power to hand out stiffer fines for violations of the state’s water laws.
Sponsored by Rep. Kristina Ortez (D-Taos) and backed by the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, HB111 would be the first to increase fines for using water without a water right since the law was passed in 1907. The bill “reflects the real cost of water,”  she said, increasing the daily penalty from $100 to $3,400 per day.
“Illegal water use and unauthorized well-drilling are increasing across New Mexico, which drains aquifers, undermines lawful water rights and shifts the cost of enforcement and scarcity onto everyone else who follows the law,” Ortez said. “At the end of the day, water laws only work if they can be enforced and HB111 makes sure that breaking the law is no longer cheaper than following it.”
Ortez said the bill does not change the process for simple mistakes made by water rights owners who exceed the amount of water they can use. Instead, it targets “egregious” cases of stealing water, and would require a determination through an administrative process, she said.
Nat Chakeres, the general counsel for the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer, told lawmakers the state has had about 20 to 25 cases in recent years that could have merited a fine.
The bill will next be heard in the House Judiciary Committee.
The committee also unanimously approved the annual request for water projects across the state. House Bill 63 includes requests for 113 projects by 75 water entities across the state for fixing water and sewage infrastructure. The $522 million request for all the projects outstrips available funds by about $187 million, according to the fiscal analysis.

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Donald Trump has been president for five years total, and there is perhaps no decision of his more baffling than the one that may doom the Gateway project.
One billion dollars have already been spent to build new rail tunnels under the Hudson River. The project is vital for the economy of not just the region, but the nation. If it’s not built, we will have to continue relying on the existing, aging tunnels that have a rapidly approaching expiration date, and catastrophe will strike. I’ve yet to find anyone to dispute any of this.
Yet Trump has halted federal funding for the project — money that has already been approved by Congress — and all signs indicate he did so just because he thrives on pissing off Democrats who oppose him.
Phil Murphy: the good, the bad, and the in-between

The Trump administration froze Gateway funding during last year’s government shutdown, and at the time indicated that tunnel funding was a bargaining chip to get Democrats to vote for a GOP spending bill. But the budget impasse ended in November and yet here we are, with no federal funding flowing to Gateway and zero explanation from the president on why he put the nation’s largest infrastructure project in the middle of his tug-of-war with Democrats.
Last year, officials with the Gateway Development Commission, which oversees the $16 billion project, said they believed the funding freeze would thaw once the shutdown ended, and construction continued, thanks to the commission’s line of credit.
But they said during the commission’s Tuesday meeting that work will stop on Feb. 6 because of the federal freeze.
The notion that Trump is acting based on pure id here led to an embarrassing display at the commission’s meeting, when a parade of union workers and elected officials sucked up to the president because they know an appeal to thought and reason won’t work, but flattery might.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05), who just six months ago campaigned for governor with an ad showing him boxing with the president, was forced to debase himself Tuesday by stroking Trump’s ego and urging him to “do something historic” by allowing Gateway to continue.
“This is what the art of the deal should be all about. So, Mr. President, let’s make the greatest deal of all time and keep this project moving forward, and make it the best tunnel America — and the world — has ever seen,” Gottheimer said to the commission.
Flattery may not work either, alas. White House spokesman Kush Desai said after the commission meeting that the Gateway project is now a bargaining chip over the current shutdown fight. U.S. Senate Democrats said they won’t vote for a homeland security funding bill without changes to immigration enforcement.
“It’s Chuck Schumer and Democrats who are standing in the way of a deal for the Gateway Tunnel Project by refusing to negotiate with the Trump administration. There is nothing stopping Democrats from prioritizing the interests of Americans over illegal aliens and getting this project back on track,” Desai said.
In other words, yes, the president is holding the new Hudson River tunnels hostage, but for a different reason than he did during last year’s government shutdown. And since Democrats folded then and Trump kept Gateway funds frozen anyway, we can look forward to the project remaining a hostage for any future budget impasse as long as Trump occupies the White House, commuters of both parties be damned. Shameful behavior from the White House.

Jan. 14, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services will no longer seek to cap weekly paid hours for live-in family caregivers as part of a Medicaid waiver that helps aging Nebraskans and those with a disability remain at home.
DHHS announced in a news release Tuesday that it was changing course at the direction of Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen after a “thorough review” and an “extensive” public input process. 
Hundreds of Nebraskans had submitted comments on the state’s proposal to cap the Aged and Disabled Waiver, which some families and waiver recipients worried could cost some their quality of life and, for others, more.
Families urge lawmakers, DHHS to stop Medicaid waiver caps for Nebraskans with disabilities, elderly

The waiver allows older adults and individuals with disabilities to receive long-term care at home or in their communities rather than in institutional settings. The waiver would need to be submitted to the federal government for review. The state’s current five-year waiver is set to expire July 31.
“I am truly appreciative of the Nebraskans who reached out to my office and participated in the public feedback process,” Pillen said Tuesday. “Based on my conversations with dedicated family members and AD Waiver recipients, I directed DHHS to take a second look at the proposal and make necessary changes to ensure Nebraska families continue receiving the support they need.”
Public pushback
DHHS had previously proposed capping live-in caregivers at 40 weekly hours and allowing up to an additional 30 hours each week if it came from someone outside the home, such as a private provider. 
The previous weekly limit for most waiver recipients was 112 hours, which will now be maintained.
Pillen’s 2026 budget proposal had included the proposed caps and estimated a budget savings of $14.12 million in state dollars next year, plus $17.18 million in federal funds.
Tony Green, director of the DHHS Division of Developmental Disabilities, previously said the goal of the changes was “stabilizing” the program and ensuring sustainability.

By mid-2025, the waiver had reached annual costs of $383.6 million, compared to $91 million in mid-2016, according to DHHS. That’s an average annual increase of about $29.3 million. 
“The revised proposal balances fiscal responsibility with the continued delivery of critical services, ensuring participants can remain safe, independent and supported in their communities while addressing unsustainable cost trends,” the Tuesday news release states.
Absent changes, Green had said previously that DHHS might need to implement a waiting list, limiting how quickly some families could access the waiver.
“The option of looking at that data and seeing those costs continue to rise at such a drastic rate, the option of doing nothing wasn’t on the table,” Green said in a previous interview.
Families and advocates had cautioned that in-home family caregivers often work for minimum wage, less than private caregivers, and are committed to the care of their loved ones. They urged DHHS to allow families to share the costs of providing compassionate, lower-cost care.
A proposed cap on the total annual costs that Medicaid would reimburse under the waiver would remain. It would be calculated on a DHHS estimate of yearly nursing home costs statewide — $92,438. An administrative review would be required if costs reach 150% ($138,657), and families could be reimbursed up to 175% ($161,767) if they pass a clinical review process with DHHS.
Opponents of the proposal had noted nursing home costs might be $1,000 a day, and for the level of care some AD Waiver recipients need, some argued the costs might well exceed $162,000 annually.
‘Huge, huge deal’
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, a Republican in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, and one of its highest-ranking members, had vowed to fight the proposal. State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a Democrat, proposed a bill to legally block the changes.
“These are the people that I want to prioritize above all else first,” Hansen previously said. “To see us deprioritize them really concerns me.”
Hansen said Tuesday he was “very pleased” with the DHHS and Pillen pivot and said there might be other ways to find cost savings.
Families fear ‘devastating’ changes to Nebraska program serving people with disabilities, elderly

Susan Samuelson, “Nana” to her grandson Hunter, who has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which causes muscles to get weaker over time, helped organize a rally at the Nebraska Capitol earlier this month to urge DHHS to change course and ask lawmakers to get involved. 
Samuelson, reached Tuesday, said she was thankful that DHHS and Pillen had paid attention to the state’s most vulnerable neighbors who, she said, deserve to have their families care for them.
“This is a huge, huge deal,” Samuelson said Tuesday. “I’m thankful for the work we did to get this done, sad that we had to go through that much. … In the long run, if they do it, that’s amazing.”
Samuelson added: “Now we need to work on our governor’s use of appropriate language,” referring to derogatory comments of left-leaning critics built on a slur for people with disabilities that he made last week. He has not publicly addressed the phrase.
The revisions will now head to a second public comment period, between Feb. 2 and March 4. Information on submitting comments will be available at https://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/DD-Public-Comment.aspx.
“DHHS is grateful for the time and thoughtful feedback Nebraskans have shared throughout this process,” Green said. “We believe these revisions will allow us to continue providing high-quality care while responsibly managing costs.”

Nick Deml, former commissioner of the Vermont Department of Corrections, will lead the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City. 
Federal district judge Laura Taylor Swain picked Deml for the role Tuesday, the New York Times reported. 
In May, the judge first decided an outside official — rather than a member of the mayor’s staff — should run the jail complex as a “remediation manager,” years into federal oversight of the scandal-plagued institution.

Swain requested that Deml meet promptly with Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s office, though Deml will not report to the new mayor.  
Roughly 7,000 people are incarcerated at Rikers, four times Vermont’s prison population. 
New York City first agreed to federal oversight of the notorious jails in 2015 following a class action lawsuit over use of force incidents, according to the Times. 
Deml stepped down from his Vermont post in August after almost four years on the job. He previously worked for the CIA and said he would begin consulting on prison-related issues following his departure. 
Under Deml’s leadership, Vermont’s Corrections Department focused on addressing substance use disorder among people in prison. The department prioritized providing medication for opioid use disorder and worked to expand peer recovery coaching and educational opportunities. 
A spate of deaths in 2022 and 2023 at the Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield also colored Deml’s tenure, as lawmakers and advocates for the incarcerated called into question the medical care provided by the prison’s health services contractor.
Deml declined to comment about his new role Tuesday, citing a court order precluding him from doing so.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)HELENA — Hundreds of people packed a Helena City Commission meeting this week to ask the city to protect them from aggressive immigration tactics by federal law enforcement agents.
The Helena City Commission voted 4-1 on Monday on a resolution reiterating its support for immigrant communities and a reminder of its policy and procedures surrounding interaction with federal law enforcement. Additionally, the resolution stipulates city police officers can ask federal agents to unmask and identify themselves at their discretion and in situations that officers believe it isn’t interfering with federal work. 
The city took up the resolution in the midst of two recent killings of citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents and increasing dissatisfaction with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics. It comes six months after a Helena resident was caught up in enforcement.
But some city officials expressed concerns such actions laid out in the resolution would potentially lead to being charged with obstruction of justice.
“I would be concerned with compelling that action of an officer, because it could be seen as obstructing justice,” Helena City Attorney Rebecca Dockter told the commission on Monday.
The resolution comes six months after Christopher Martinez was arrested by law enforcement after a request from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stop him, believing him to be someone else they were investigating. A Helena Police Officer joked he was being kidnapped and Martinez, who was trying to stay in the country legally, faced deportation and eventually left to return to Mexico.
The case sparked outrage in Helena and beyond, with Martinez’s lawyers arguing in court he was racially profiled. 
Since then, Helena has pulled out of a regional drug task force, city officials said on Monday night, and commenters on the resolution heavily praised steps the police force has taken, saying they’ve taken the concerns seriously.
“(Martinez) was arrested because he was mistaken for a different brown man. That is embarrassing, and I do think that the city recognizes that with how swift the response was, this resolution came out very quickly after the initial arrest,” Emilia Hitchcock, a Helena attorney, told the commission, adding “the Helena Police Department has clearly tried to make some changes.”
Many in attendance viewed the resolution as a first step as city officials were asked to protect their citizens from federal agents. Federal officers have killed two people in Minneapolis, including Alex Pretti, a 37-year old nurse at a VA Hospital who was shot Saturday. Some in attendance on Monday were openly wondering if similar events could play out in Helena.
“We’ve seen it happen elsewhere,” said Shani Henry, a Helena resident. “We should not kid ourselves that it won’t happen here.”
There was unfiltered disgust by those in attendance with violent immigration tactics and a deep anger that fundamental liberties Americans enjoy were being taken away.
“This is not public safety. This is not justice,” said Valerie Hellermann, executive director of the Helena Area Refugee Resettlement Team. “We don’t want this in Helena, our local law enforcement should not be obligated to cooperate with practices that undermine trust, due process, and human dignity.”
Overflow rooms were full at the City-County building, and 62 people gave comments to the City Commission in person, while another 11 spoke via Zoom. Additional written comments were also collected during the meeting. The meeting lasted about four hours, with around three of those dedicated to the resolution.
All but about five of the comments were in support of the resolution. Speakers included two Montana State senators — Laura Smith and Mary Ann Dunwell, both Democrats representing Helena — as well as community leaders at advocacy organizations, religious groups and a wave of concerned citizens. 
“(The resolution) requests that the city take steps to ensure that the residents here know that the city is on our side and not on the side of a federal agency that is terrorizing black and brown people as a pretext for harassing cities that vote for Democrats,” said SK Rossi, who spoke on the resolution as a local business owner. “That’s the reality of what is happening here, and we should be opposing it with every fiber of our beings.”
One long-time Helena resident, an immigrant, spoke about the fear she has driving to Target with her daughter, and how they now have photos of their passports on their phones.
Proposed amendments from Commissioner Melinda Reed.
“You never know,” said Linda Cleatus, describing that fear.
Multiple members of the Helena LGBTQ+ community also spoke, relaying fears about how the persecution they’ve faced is now expanding to other groups.
“As a politically targeted community that has lived in increasing fear, we recognize and refuse to ignore it when we see it happening to other communities,” Shawn Reagor, with Montana Gender Alliance, told the Commission.
Well over 100 community members gathered before the City Commission meeting on the steps of the City-County building, waving signs over an hour before the Commission meeting started.
Some discussion was had over several amendments to the resolution proposed by Commissioner Melinda Reed. They dealt with data collection, including one with the ethnicity of the person being stopped and another asking the department track how often they “officially” coordinate with federal immigration officers. Coordination with various federal law enforcement agencies happens nearly daily, on a wide variety of issues, city officials said Monday.
Police officers also cannot legally ask a person’s race during a stop, but the data is informally collected by officers and reviewed twice per year. If there are issues with those stops, an internal investigation is launched, police officials said Monday night.
“If we notice flags or anything that’s super concerning on that, that would generate a review of their traffic stops,” said Helena Police Lt. Adam Shanks. 
Additionally, racial data from stops is collected per state code, though Shanks said that he called the state Board of Crime Control and they didn’t have it on hand, because they’re not supposed to share the data unless it’s formally requested.
“The people I spoke with on the Board of Crime Control and Data Warehouse don’t actually know how to get that information,” Shanks said. 
None of the amendments passed, leading to some frustration among attendees when the matter was put to vote at almost 10 p.m. 
Sen. Ellie Boldman, a Missoula Democrat, has also proposed legislation to have immigration officers clearly mark who they are, to not wear masks and to have certain areas be protected from raids.
There was also a sense the resolution was just one step in protecting Helena citizens and more action was going to be asked for by members of the public.
“Today’s vote matters in and of itself for what it means to set a standard for a welcoming community committed to civil and to human rights,” Rachel Carroll Rivas, a longtime human rights activist in Helena, told the commission. “But today is also practice, practice for the potential consequential moments that are to come when you will be needed by this community to stand in your power in opposition to authoritarianism when it comes knocking on the door of Helena.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/HelenaCC1-1024x657.jpg,,,2026-01-27 17:58:07.132645

Zakiya Summers, D-Jackson, scans the House floor on the first day of the 2026 regular session, Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2026, at the Mississippi Capitol in Jackson, Miss.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Most Mississippi public school teachers are in the middle of a six-week payday gap. 
Their last payday was on Dec. 19, before winter break and amid several holidays. A bill authored by Rep. Zakiyah Summers, a Democrat from Jackson, would add a payday in early January, giving teachers financial relief before the end of the month.
House Bill 1420, or the Spring-Step Teacher Pay Bridge Act, has bipartisan interest, she said. The fight to improve teachers’ quality of life has a direct impact on student success, she said.
“We know that when we’re positioning our teachers to be successful, we’re also positioning our schools to be successful, our districts, and of course our communities to be successful as well,” Summers said.  
The bill is with the House Education and Appropriations committees. There is no guarantee that it will progress.
“We’re looking into it,” said Rob Roberson, chairman of the House Education Committee and a Republican from Starkville. “We’re trying to find an option that doesn’t necessarily include having to change a law, but works with MDE (the Mississippi Department of Education) to help alleviate some of the stress on teachers.”
“I understand the problem she’s trying to solve,” Roberson said of Summers. “I want our solution to be one that we can get districts to buy into as well.”
In a Facebook post announcing the bill, Summers said teachers are “the soldiers in the classrooms” and critical to schools’ success. 
“Teachers should not have to struggle financially just because of how the calendar falls,” Summers wrote.“This bill recognizes the reality of educators’ lives and provides stability when it’s needed most.”
Summers’ bill would split teachers’ monthly salary in half for January, with one payment on Jan. 7 and the other at the end of the month. For now, the stretch between mid-December, which includes the winter holiday season, is particularly stressful for teachers, said Nick Johnson, a teacher in Grenada.

The time between December and January pay is a reminder “that passion pays the heart, not always the bills,” Johnson said. What many assume is a relaxing time for teachers, is actually the more stressful, he said.
“So while the calendar says ‘break,’ the bank account says ‘budget carefully,’ and the mind says, ‘you’re still on,’” Johnson said. “That gap is when you really learn how to budget, how to stretch a check, and how much you do this job for purpose, and not pay.”
Educators have told Mississippi Today about discouraging colleagues from frequenting payday loan stores in January. Administrators, including former Greenwood-Leflore Consolidated School District Superintendent Mary Johnson, have said biweekly paydays for teachers help with retention. 
Biweekly pay is doable, but with challenges
State law has allowed Mississippi public school districts to pay teachers semimonthly, or every two weeks, since 2022.
Four school districts — Lowndes County, Greenwood, Holly Springs and Harrison County — adopted biweekly pay in time for the 2025-26 school year.
Gulfport School District adopted biweekly pay but reverted to monthly pay. Processing more payments required more staff,  Superintendent Glen East said. Officials from six other districts shared similar concerns with Mississippi Today.
Chris Chism, superintendent of Pearl Public School district, has researched whether it was possible to pay teachers later in December to shorten the gap between their January pay. However, state law requires school districts to pay employees on the last working day of December.
“If they would just rescind that law, then you could actually just pay at the end of December, and that would solve the problem,” Chism said.
Banks routinely hold paychecks until the end of the month for companies, and can easily do so also for school district employees, said Paige Bromen, chief financial officer of Pearl schools.
Paying employees in mid-December could also strain district finances, Bromen said, because the state pays school systems’ funding allotment the last week of each month. The state Department of Education can only provide school districts with their monthly funding allocation “two business days prior to the last working day of each month,” according to state law.
Raising teacher pay, which proponents say could help with recruitment and retention, is already on the agenda for state legislators this session. Some educators say closing the winter pay gap could help too.
What may seem to be a small change could make a big difference with attracting people to the profession, said Ebony Rice, president of the Jackson Federation of Teachers. 
“Our teachers work extremely hard in the classroom. The expectations that they are faced with on a daily basis are more than ever before,” Rice said. “Teaching is … a lot more complicated than it used to be. It’s a lot more demanding than it used to be.”
Closing the winter pay gap, she said, could help current teachers “feel more comfortable with staying here in the state of Mississippi as opposed to leaving.”
A former teacher inspired HB 1420 bill and, Summers said, made her aware of a burden that’s likely unknown to non-educators. 
“Teachers are the true champions in the classroom that make the difference between whether or not we’re at the bottom of the education ratings or where we are now,” Summers said. “This is one thing we can do for them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/06160335/829A0563.jpg,,,2026-01-27 17:58:07.132645

(Photo: NCGA livestream) A legislative oversight committee has rescheduled a high-profile hearing slated for Thursday to examine the safety of the Charlotte Area Transit System.
The chairs of the House Select Committee on Oversight and Reform are seeking clarification of a federal court order issued earlier this month that limits state lawmakers from publicly disclosing information related to Decarlos Brown, who is charged in the murder of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte’s light rail system.
U.S. Magistrate David Keesler wrote in his Jan. 15 order that the court “determines Defendant has sufficiently shown release of the materials may prejudice his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial, and may cause other harms including risking the safety of witnesses.”
That preliminary protective order essentially blocked the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and the Mecklenburg County District Attorney’s office from releasing any criminal investigative files related to the August 22, 2025, stabbing to any third party, including the North Carolina General Assembly.
The legislative committee had directed Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, District Attorney Spencer Merriweather, Charlotte Mecklenburg Sheriff Garry McFadden, and newly appointed Charlotte Police Chief Estella Patterson to make the three-hour trek to Raleigh to discuss public safety in Charlotte and on the transit system.
The Charlotte leaders were also advised they should also be prepared to discuss their strategic plans, spending, and the city’s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
Republican legislators have said that Zarutska’s stabbing death was the result of ‘soft on crime policies’ by Democrats.
Gov. Josh Stein signed “Iryna’s Law” in early October, praising changes to the pre-trial release process, although Stein described other proposed changes in the law to pursue alternative methods of execution for those convicted of violent crimes as “barbaric.”

(Screenshot)OKLAHOMA CITY — Dozens of outraged Oklahomans on Tuesday spent hours lambasting a proposed Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility slated to open in the south part of the city.
But city councilors, who spent over three hours listening to public comment about the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s planned immigration processing center, said their hands were tied.
They said they have no power to stop the federal agency’s plans to convert a warehouse, located at 2800 S. Council Road, into a facility that would be used to detain, question and process individuals accused of violating immigration laws because of the Supremacy Clause, which mandates that federal law overrules state and local statute.
However, city leaders said they are none-the-less urging DHS to go through the special permitting process that applies to the private sector. 
“It is the City of Oklahoma City’s longstanding position that decisions about land use are best made locally,” the city wrote in a statement. “The placement of a detention facility is an issue of local interest that would benefit from a public process involving residents, especially the neighbors of such a facility. Any private sector activity would be subject to such a process.”
A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately return a message left seeking comment Tuesday afternoon.
The impassioned public comment comes a little more than a month after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security first notified Oklahoma City leaders of its intent to purchase the warehouse to “support ICE operations” as a processing center, according to a letter sent to city officials last month. 
Dozens of community members Tuesday shared emotional testimony and asked the City Council to push back against the proposed center, either by suing the federal government or finding other ways to support immigrant communities. 
Laura Susana Tapia said she works with Oklahoma City’s Latino community every day and that despite Oklahoma City’s policy to not ask about immigration status when it comes to essential services, people are afraid. 
“But that policy alone is not enough to ease the concerns of our communities when every day on our screens we are seeing families ripped apart, inhumane detention centers, and even the execution of U.S. citizens,” she said. “I ask you to please make decisions that empower our community to feel safe and protected in our homes.”
Several Oklahomans pointed to municipal action taken in Kansas City, Missouri, which created a five-year moratorium on non-municipal detention facilities, which would include ICE. 
Legal counsel for Oklahoma City’s city council said action such as this would not be likely to legally restrict the federal government’s ability to proceed with the processing center in south Oklahoma City, according to a statement. 
Tamya Cox-Touré, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, said that the ACLU is ready to help fight against the detention center and sue the federal government to push back against government overreach. 
“We completely understand your position that you feel your hands may be tied, but we cannot accept that position at this time,” she said. “We believe there are ways and meaningful ways that you can move forward to ensure that this facility does not happen.”
Cox-Toure said the City Council can take other action, like passing an eviction moratorium to aid Oklahoma City residents who cannot pay their bills while being detained by ICE. 
The City sent Oklahoma’s federal congressional delegation and DHS letters about the proposed facility on Jan. 21 and 22, respectively, emphasizing that the city would like the federal government to apply for a special use permit despite the Supremacy Clause making it technically unnecessary. 
A special permit would allow for public comment and input as well as a review of how the proposed facility would affect traffic, public safety and the surrounding community. 
Council members Camal Pennington, Ward 7, James Cooper, Ward 2, and JoBeth Hamon, Ward 6, were vocal about their opposition to the proposed ICE facility. 
Hamon said she is determined to use her platform and power to push back against the ICE facility. 
“None of us want to be in the position of saying we could have done something and we didn’t do anything,” she said. 
Pennington said he hopes the federal government will comply with Oklahoma City’s current requirements and seek a special permit so the public is allowed to speak about the facility. 
Chris Fowler, an Oklahoma City resident, said he questioned the safety of having an ICE facility so close to neighborhoods and schools. 
The proposed ICE facility is blocks from Western Heights High School and across the street from an Oklahoma City Fire Department station. 
“As we see nationwide and in our own city, where ICE goes, protests increase, traffic, and 24/7 law enforcement operations follow,” Fowler said. “So what is going to happen in these neighborhoods, to these businesses, to these schools.”
There are currently multiple ICE detention centers in Oklahoma, including in Watonga, Cushing and Newkirk.

Jan. 27, 2026. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), the chair of the House Oversight Committee, said that the Michigan Attorney General’s office is “either wholly incompetent or it is corrupt” in a hearing of the Oversight Committee on ethics violations allegedly committed by Attorney General Dana Nessel and her office. 
The testimony from two members of the House legal counsel team centered on alleged insurance fraud and embezzlement by Traci Kornak, a lawyer and former treasurer of the Michigan Democratic Party who served on Nessel’s transition team, who was the conservator of an elderly woman in Kent County. 
This is the second hearing on these ethics concerns, following testimony in December on the use of isolation walls — which prevent the Attorney General from influencing decisions in a case where there is a conflict of interest — in the investigation into Kornak, in which the Attorney General’s office closed the file in 2022. 
“The Attorney General’s office told adult protective services that it should not help a vulnerable adult despite the results of a two year investigation and the conclusion that the vulnerable adult was the victim of financial exploitation,” said Catherine Edwards, a staff attorney for the House legal team.

Following that December hearing, a statement from Nessel’s office denied all allegations of wrongdoing, adding that “areas of confusion created by the committee” included conflating the closing of a file, which it termed “an administrative function of little consequence,” and the actual conclusion of an investigation. 
Republicans on the committee tied the results of the investigation by the Attorney General’s office to the relationship between Nessel and Kornak. 
“I want to remind you the words of the Attorney General’s Office. ‘This is a sensitive case, so you need to be careful’,” DeBoyer said. “Why is this case sensitive? I’ll tell you why this case is sensitive. This case is sensitive because Ms. Kornak has a direct relationship with the Attorney General.”
“They’re the number one law enforcement agency in the state, yet a probate court and Adult Protective Services and the Kent County Sheriff has done a more extensive, more thorough, more in depth investigation,” he continued.
However, AG spokesperson Kimberly Bush told the Advance in an email request for comment that the committee “continues to conflate the Attorney General’s investigation with subsequent, separate investigations by other agencies that were predicated on separate allegations made by different complainants involving a different victim, that began only after the Attorney General’s investigation was concluded.”
Democrats on the committee, including Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing) and Rep. Denise Mentzer, (D-Mt. Clemens), also questioned whether or not Nessel had any relevant role in the way that Kornak’s case was handled — including whether or not Nessel and Kornak had any close relationship beyond the transition team. 
“Do we have other evidence that these two are somehow best friends, or she’s been donating huge amounts to her campaign, or is it just based on this transition team connection?” Tsernoglou asked, to which Edwards responded that the only documentation they had regarding their relationship was the document establishing the isolation wall for Nessel in the case, which referenced a personal relationship. 
DeBoyer also indicated that there could be further testimony on this case from attorneys from the Attorney General’s office, who the office has offered to have testify, according to records read in the hearing and reconfirmed by Bush.
“They have yet to take us up on that offer, likely because this inquiry is merely political in nature and intended to attack the Attorney General herself, with or without the facts in their favor, and not to truly learn what happened,” Bush said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_3956-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 16:57:01.151091

Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, in May 2024. (Photo courtesy of Dan Helmer campaign)Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, has reached a settlement with all parties in a defamation lawsuit he filed more than a year ago, ending a legal battle tied to sexual assault allegations that surfaced days before he finished second in a crowded June 2024 Democratic primary for Virginia’s 10th Congressional District. 
The lawsuit was originally filed against Avram Fechter, Charles King and Lissa Savaglio. Fechter and Savaglio have been involved with the Loudoun County Democratic Committee, while King has served as Savaglio’s attorney. Savaglio was the most recent to settle; the other two defendants reached a settlement late last year. 
The original allegation stemmed from an alleged sexual assault by Helmer at a 2018 event, in which he was accused of inappropriately touching Savaglio. 
In seeking the defamation suit, Helmer cited refuting evidence that included screenshots of text messages between the two, in which she warned that a “grassroots activist” had asked her about rumors of sexual misconduct and described the claims as “typical Republican tactics.” 
Helmer’s suit also included an image of Savaglio on the night of the alleged incident at a different event, suggesting she was not with Helmer when the purported altercation took place.
Around the time the allegation surfaced, NOTUS reported that the alleged incident prompted the Loudoun County Democratic Committee to adopt new policies aimed at  preventing sexual misconduct. 
Fechter added at the time that no immediate action against Helmer was pursued in 2018 because the alleged victim — later identified as Savaglio — was not yet willing to come forward publicly. 
Delays in reporting sexual assault can be nuanced, with multiple studies indicating that the relationship between a survivor and the alleged perpetrator is a common factor. 
Still, Helmer has maintained that the allegations were politically motivated, accusing the defendants of attempting to damage his campaign in favor of his opponent, Suhas Subramanyam, who went on to win the nomination and now serves as the district’s congressman. 
“While we always knew our politics were dirty, the false accusations leveled against me were a new low,” Helmer said in a statement. “They caused immeasurable harm to myself, my wife and my two children.”
With settlements now reached with all parties, Helmer said that he believes the defendants acknowledge they would have lost in court had the case gone to trial. An aide for Helmer confirmed that Savaglio agreed to the terms of the settlement and the release. 
Helmer had originally sought $15 million in damages and did not disclose additional terms of the settlement.

Sarah Beckstrom, 20, of Webster Springs, died of her wounds the next day. U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, of Martinsburg, survived the attack and is recovering. 
Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, has been charged with murder and other charges for the attack. He pleaded not guilty.
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia challenged the deployment in court. In November 2025, Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Richard Lindsay dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the deployment was legal because Trump requested states to send their National Guard members to D.C. 
More than 2,000 troops were deployed to D.C. from at least 11 Republican-led states and the District in August and hundreds more were added after the attack, according to NPR. In December, a federal appeals court in Washington D.C. ruled that troops can remain in Washington, D.C. while a panel of judges examines whether the deployment ordered by Trump is legal, according to reporting by NPR. 
In a statement Tuesday, West Virginia Adjutant General Maj. Gen. Jim Seward said the mission “reflects the high level of readiness and professionalism of the West Virginia National Guard.”
“Our men and women are well-trained, prepared to serve wherever they are called, and trusted to carry out any task,” Seward said. “I am proud to serve with them and proud of the way they represent our state.”

A House bill cleared its first committee Jan. 27, 2026 that would provide acequias a permanent funding stream. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)A New Mexico House committee on Tuesday approved a bill that seeks to give the state’s acequias a dedicated funding stream, following several recent natural disasters and challenges advocates say the historic irrigation canals face in accessing public funds.
House Bill 21, which Rep. Miguel Garcia (D-Albuquerque) sponsored, would make for a “monumental” change for the more than 700 acequias — historic irrigation canals — that wind through the state, Garcia told the House Rural Development, Land Grants and Cultural Affairs Committee. 
Acequias, along with land-grant mercedes, count as public entities under state law and predate New Mexico’s statehood by hundreds of years, but they have small or nonexistent budgets and few means of generating enough of their own funding to pay for needed repairs. 
The bill would establish a permanent trust fund that generates consistent revenues for acequias and land grants each year from severance tax bonds. State financial analysts estimate the fund would generate slightly more than  $20 million annually to be split evenly between acequias and land-grant mercedes.
New Mexico Acequia Association Director Paula Garcia told lawmakers Tuesday that acequias statewide have $73 million in unmet needs despite efforts to access state or federal funds meant for water, infrastructure or disaster projects.
Lawmakers push for permanent funding for acequias and land grant mercedes in 2026 session

“The primary rationale for this bill is to have a reliable, recurring funding source for acequia infrastructure,” she said. “The needs are tremendous across the state.”
Acequias have to compete with other public entities for water project funding from the Water Trust Board, and an existing fund for acequia projects that the Interstate Stream Commission oversees is too small, Garcia said. 
As for capital outlay, the state’s main process for paying for infrastructure, acequia leaders testified during public comment Tuesday that the process can be inadequate or slow, especially amid a backlog of projects. 
“Even when you get capital outlay, sometimes you have to look for other sources of income to complete the project,” said Presiliano Torrez, who described trying to get funds for an acequia called Storm Ditch in Lincoln County damaged in recent wildfires in the Ruidoso area. 
Wildfires across the state have put acequias everywhere into a “a crisis situation,” Torrez said. 
“You have Mora, Las Vegas; you have Ruidoso; you have Silver City, all of which have been hit by fires,” he said. “What has happened to us as a result of fire is that we get cascading events that clog up the ditch.”
Acequias across the state have reported challenges accessing federal disaster aid, as well through a Federal Emergency Management Agency program called Public Assistance. 
In addition to acequias’ historic value, the waterways remain vital for thousands of farmers and rural families across New Mexico and benefit public and private well systems by distributing water across the landscape, Garcia and other acequia stewards said..

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)The House of Delegates overwhelmingly passed a measure Tuesday that would increase penalties for human trafficking and human smuggling in West Virginia.
The measure, House Bill 4433, would expand the state’s definitions of human trafficking, smuggling crimes, forced labor and more. The measure establishes specific felony penalties for the illegal transport of adults and minors.
“There’s no confusion about what the intent of this bill is,” said Del. J.B. Akers, R-Kanawha, a co-sponsor of the legislation. “This bill is meant to provide protection within our state for victims of human trafficking and smuggling. It’s meant to send a message that those crimes are not welcome here.”
West Virginia’s definition of human smuggling would be changed to include transporting, isolating and harboring an “illegal alien” to avoid law enforcement, according to the bill. 
The measure passed 88-9 with all nine members of the House Democratic caucus voting against the measure.
Ahead of the vote, some House Democrats spoke out about the measure, fearing it would penalize church groups or nonprofit organizations helping immigrants without legal status, including giving them a ride to the grocery store.
House members on Friday voted down a proposed amendment by Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, that would have changed the definition of human smuggling to include that it required an intent of financial or material benefit.
W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, said during the bill debate that there were some parts of the legislation that were good but said it “was flawed.” 
It would create conflicting state- and federal-level laws, Hornbuckle said. 
“It goes after West Virginians and not illegal aliens. It targets and captures the innocent, not just those with ill intent,” he said. “It’s going to infringe upon people practicing religious freedoms, people invoking a person from human rights. The smuggling portion is far too vague and overly broad.”
Hornbuckle continued, “At this current juncture, it’s all about (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). It’s about the interactions that can potentially happen with West Virginians. That is the reality of a piece of legislation.”
Akers emphasized that the bill would not criminalize people who aid undocumented immigrants if their intention is only to provide help.
“The only way you will ever have any criminal culpability under this bill for human smuggling is if you know that the person has illegal status in this country, and if the entire purpose of your assistance to that person is to help them evade law enforcement,” Akers said. “That’s the same as federal law, except this bill is actually more lenient than federal law.”
Hornbuckle also criticized the measure for doing nothing to help West Virginians with jobs, child care, utilities and more.
“The bill is irrelevant to the everyday life of West Virginians,” he said. 
Akers noted that there are approximately 400,000 American citizens who are trafficked annually in the United States, many of whom are women and children.
“The less we have to fight smuggling and human trafficking, the more money we have to help our state, and that creates jobs, more importantly, protects lives,” Akers said.
The measure exempts individuals providing medical or mental health services to undocumented individuals. It also exempts licensed attorneys who have an active attorney-client relationship with an undocumented person for an immigration case or related to a criminal matter against the undocumented person. 
The measure now goes to the Senate for consideration.
The House has passed similar versions of the human trafficking and smuggling bill in the last two years, but the Senate has declined to take those measures up for consideration.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) reported that the individual’s illness was “related to international travel.” Citing privacy concerns, the department withheld all other information, including demographic information about the patient and whether or not the individual was vaccinated.
DHS and the Waukesha County Health and Human Services department are working to identify and notify people who might have been exposed to the individual. DHS reported that no public places where others might have been exposed have been identified.
The illness was the first confirmed case of measles in Wisconsin for 2026, according to DHS, and was confirmed by the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene. 
The department is urging state residents to get a measles vaccination if they haven’t done so already.
A report in mid-December from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found there had been 1,958 confirmed cases of measles in 43 states last year through Dec. 16, and a sharp increase in December raised concerns for holiday travelers, Stateline reported.
State health officials are urging Wisconsin residents to check their vaccination status “to make sure they are protected from measles.” The department is advising people with winter vacation plans to check measles activity in the places they plan to visit and confirm that they and any traveling companions are up to date on needed vaccines.

Earlier this month, Dispatch Energy — a New York-based developer of distributed energy projects — announced that a 4-megawatt fuel cell facility located within the Bunnell Block, a former brownfield site in the city’s East End, was up and running.
The project is the third fuel cell facility to open on a former brownfield in Bridgeport, according to Ed Lavernoich, the president of the Bridgeport Economic Development Corporation. A fourth fuel cell sits atop a former landfill in the city’s Seaside Park.
Because it is more costly to remediate old industrial sites to a standard that would allow residential development, Lavernoich said, fuel cells offer a relatively easy path toward finding a productive — and taxable — use for those properties, particularly those located on smaller or oddly shaped tracts of land.
“The return in that sense for the city is a very good one,” Lavernoich said. “Also these contribute to the resilience of the electrical grid here in this region and certainly within the city. So, it wins in both ways.”
Fuel cells utilize a chemical reaction to convert natural gas or hydrogen into electricity without having to burn it. The natural gas reaction produces about half of the CO2 emissions of a typical gas-fired power plant, and much lower amounts of nitrogen oxides, sulfur and other harmful pollutants. Hydrogen fuel cells produce only water as a byproduct of the chemical reaction. Fuel cells are not intermittent, meaning they can dispatch electricity onto the grid whenever it is needed — a factor that proponents tout as a way to manage the region’s growing demand for electricity.
However, because most fuel cells rely on natural gas and produce some emissions, fuel cells have also faced criticism from climate advocates and, in some cases, local community members.
Samantha Dynowski, the president of the state chapter of the Sierra Club, called the growth of fuel cell development in Connecticut “unfortunate” and driven by incentives for the industry enacted by lawmakers, including the availability of renewable energy credits.
Connecticut is home to more than 100 fuel cells, with dozens more slated for development. 
“That was a policy choice, and it’s a policy choice we think should end, and that we should be focusing on true renewables,” Dynowski said. “It just it furthers our over-reliance on methane gas.”
Developers and some state officials, however, argue that fuel cells offer a unique solution for both meeting energy demands and revitalizing blighted brownfields. 
Ray Frigon, the director of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s Remediation Division, called such projects a “win-win” for the state’s efforts to cleanup brownfields and boost the development of renewable energy. DEEP’s most recent inventory lists nearly 900 brownfield sites around the state.
“DEEP very much promotes the use of green energy as either the end-use or a part of the end-use for a brownfield site,” Frigon said. “Many of these brownfield sites across our state are located within urban centers where you have public water, sewer, natural gas, the electricity infrastructure necessary for connection.”
The Bunnell Block site that is home to the Bridgeport’s newest fuel cell had been contaminated with petroleum, lead and other pollutants that are often left over from the burning of coal, oil and gas. A state and federally funded remediation effort, which included the razing of old industrial buildings, was completed in 2005.
In 2018, Willie McBride purchased the site from the Bridgeport Economic Development Corporation to build a new headquarters for his electrical contracting business. After completing that project, he said, he began looking for some way to make use of a leftover piece of the property that remained undeveloped.
That’s when he came across a solicitation from the local utility, United Illuminating, seeking proposals to build fuel cells in response to a 2021 state law intended to spur development of the technology. The law, Public Act 21-162, gives preference to projects located on brownfield sites or former landfills.
After submitting a proposal and having it accepted, McBride partnered with Dispatch to design and develop the project. McBride’s electrical company also served as the general contractor on the project. 
McBride, who grew up in the area, said that the fuel cell is a better fit for the neighborhood than larger fossil fuel plants that have long dominated the city’s skyline. Solar panels also would have been impractical, he said, as it would have required acres of land to produce a similar output.
“It’s not industrial with smoke stacks and smoke coming out of it,” McBride said. “It’s really slick looking and modern.”
The city’s first fuel cell project to be located on a former brownfield was the 14.9 megawatt project developed by Dominion Energy and Danbury-based FuelCell Energy Inc. At the time that project opened in 2013, it was the largest facility of its kind in North America.
FuelCell Energy later purchased the fuel cell from Dominion for $36 million. Kat Blomquist, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an email this week that the re-development of brownfields into fuel cells can help Connecticut attract investment in data centers and other digital infrastructure projects, which often require huge amounts of electricity.
“Our fuel cell platforms are mission-critical, always-on, distributed baseload power assets,” Blomquist said. “They operate quietly, have a compact footprint, and produce virtually no criteria pollutants at the point of use. That makes them well-suited for brownfield redevelopment, where minimizing disruption and environmental impact is essential.”
As more and more fuel cells have come online in Bridgeport, some residents have pushed back against their concentration in neighborhoods already struggling with poor air quality and a legacy of hosting much of the state’s power generation. 
Kate Rivera, a resident of Seaside Village, was involved with a group that fought the development of NuPower Energy’s 9.66-megawatt fuel cell on a triangle-shaped lot wedged between the Metro-North tracks and Interstate 95. The project, which was not identified in its application records as being located on a former brownfield, began construction in mid-2025. 
“We are inundated with these industrial sites in our residential neighborhoods,” Rivera said. 
“It’s really environmental racism, it’s environmental classism,” she continued. “They wouldn’t even approach a more affluent area to put this crap there, let alone build it and then have us bear the burden of several fuel cells and the gas company and I-95.”
According to the data from the Connecticut Siting Council — which typically handles permits for fuel cells and other grid-scale energy projects — at least two other fuel cell projects have been approved for construction on former brownfield sites in Ansonia and Stratford.
Ben Samways, a senior director at Dispatch said that the appeal of brownfield properties for fuel cell development is largely the result of the infrastructure, particularly access to gas pipelines and nearby transmission wires that are leftover from prior industrial uses. (Due to local support for the project, Samways said Dispatch obtained permits from officials Bridgeport, rather than going through the Siting Council).
“What these brownfield sites are like, it’s not always, but often it’s like an old manufacturing facility,” Samways said. “It’s right in somewhere downtown or something … so a fuel cell fits in really neatly.”
Samways said Dispatch is looking to build three additional fuel cell projects in Connecticut, and is eyeing potential brownfield sites for all of them.
“It’s now a function of finding the best site,” he said. “If we can reuse a brownfield site that has a low cost of rent, that’s great for the community. But it’s also a function of how expensive the utility is going to make it for us to connect from a power perspective.”
While Samways said the exact cost of those projects is confidential, he said the Bunnell Block facility was in the range of $16 million. The project is supported by an agreement to sell its power to United Illuminating for 20 years under the state’s Shared Clean Energy Facilities program.

Robin Kelly, who authored the measure. “Kristi Noem should be fired immediately, or we will commence impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives. We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said in a statement Tuesday.Kelly’s three articles of impeachment against Noem accuse the secretary of obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust and self-dealing. The resolution came after the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by a federal agent in Minneapolis.  Democratic calls for Noem’s impeachment grew even louder after federal agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis Jan. 24. President Donald Trump’s administration has taken heat for its immigration enforcement tactics and appeared to dial down its rhetoric following the shooting. Republicans control the U.S. House with a narrow 218-member majority.In a statement shared with States Newsroom on Tuesday, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the department, said, “DHS enforces the laws Congress passes, period,” adding that “if certain members don’t like those laws, changing them is literally their job.” “While (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers are facing a staggering 1,300% spike in assaults, too many politicians would rather defend criminals and attack the men and women who are enforcing our laws and did nothing while Joe Biden facilitated an invasion of tens of millions of illegal aliens into our country,” McLaughlin said. “It’s time they focus on protecting the American people, the work this Department is doing every day under Secretary Noem’s leadership.”Here’s a list of the Democratic co-sponsors, as of Tuesday afternoon, per Kelly’s office: AlabamaRep.

Tuberville has long faced questions about his residency in the state. Tuberville moved to Alabama in 1999 when he started coaching football for Auburn University. He told Alabama Daily News last summer that time contributed to his residency qualification, and has said a homestead exemption claimed on property in Auburn by his wife and son in 2018 is proof of residence. AL.com reported in May of last year that Tuberville and his wife voted in Florida in 2018, after the homestead exemption was claimed.

“The governor and lieutenant governor shall each be at least thirty years of age when elected, and shall have been citizens of the United States ten years and resident citizens of this state at least seven years next before the date of their election,” the Constitution reads.
McFeeters believes the Constitution means seven consecutive years.
“Courts have consistently held that it means the seven-year period immediately preceding the election, without interruption, not an aggregate total accumulated over time,” he wrote.
Susan Hamill, a law professor at the University of Alabama, said in a statement Monday afternoon that while the language of the state constitution is vague, Alabama’s history and culture supports a consecutive seven-year residency minimum.
McFeeters suggests that Tuberville’s financial records submitted to the federal government suggest that his residence is not in Auburn. 
“However, extensive travel records disclosed through his Senate expense reports and his political action committee filings appear to show repeated and sustained travel to and from Florida, with minimal evidence of regular travel to or from Auburn,” McFeeters wrote.
If Tuberville is proven to not live in Alabama, McFeeters said that would also mean Tuberville and his wife have illegally voted in the state’s elections.
“The Party cannot credibly maintain both that he was not a resident for constitutional purposes and that his voting history was lawful,” McFeeters wrote.
Jeannie Burniston, communications director for the Alabama GOP, said Tuesday that the party does not comment on specific candidate challenges.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0255-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 16:57:01.151091

NEWARK, Del. — Stablecoins are quickly becoming one of the most practical — and most talked-about — tools in the digital-assets world, because they’re designed to hold a steady value while moving on blockchain-based networks.
The University of Delaware’s FinTech Innovation Hub will take a closer look at what stablecoins are, how they work, and why banks and payment companies are paying attention during a virtual event, “Stablecoins and the Future of Banking,” set for noon to 1 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 18. The session will feature Jack Jacobs of Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, and is billed as beginner-friendly.
What is a stablecoin?
A stablecoin is a digital asset designed to maintain a stable value relative to a national currency or other reference asset — most commonly the U.S. dollar. Unlike many cryptocurrencies that swing sharply in price, stablecoins are typically marketed as being pegged to a sovereign currency like the dollar, aiming to make them more usable for everyday financial activity and business settlement.
In plain terms: stablecoins are often described as “digital dollars” that can be sent and settled quickly online — including outside normal banking hours — using blockchain rails.
Why people in banking and fintech are watching
The debate around stablecoins isn’t just a crypto story anymore. Policymakers and regulators have been studying how stablecoins fit into the broader financial system, including potential uses in payments and the consumer-protection questions that come with them.
UD’s event description frames stablecoins as a “bridge” between today’s financial system and emerging blockchain-enabled payments — and promises an overview focused on real-world use cases and key regulatory issues, without getting overly technical.
What the UD webinar will cover
According to UD’s FinTech Innovation Hub, the session will include:


a plain-language explanation of how stablecoins work


how stablecoins compare with traditional banking rails


where stablecoins are being used today


regulation and security considerations


trends to watch in the next few years


How to attend
The event is virtual, and the Zoom link will be provided upon registration. Registration is required by Feb. 16, according to UD.

(Stock photo by David Espejo/Getty Images)An Iowa Senate bill that advanced from a subcommittee Tuesday would limit the uses of artificial intelligence in state agencies. 
Senate Study Bill 3014 would require state agencies to disclose the use of artificial intelligence tools and prohibit the use of artificial intelligence in matters that impacted a state employee’s employment status, bargaining rights, wages, transfer or eligible hours. 
Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, said the bill is “setting some guidelines in the use of AI.” 
“In short, this bill outlines things that basically humans do now, that AI has kind of reached into both now and into the future that could take over those practices,” McClintock said. 
Technology groups, state agencies and business entities expressed interest in the bill, but only unions representing state employees registered in favor of the bill. 
Peter Hird on behalf of the Iowa Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, said in the subcommittee that the bill is “getting out in front” of artificial intelligence. 
“These are human beings that work for the state of Iowa, we need to make sure that we’re treating them with the dignity and respect they have,” Hird said. 
Reports show that artificial intelligence models are widely used by employers to screen resumes, script interviews or gather data about candidates.
Recently, an AI recruitment company, utilized by a slew of big name companies including Microsoft and PayPal, was sued by the state of California for allegedly compiling reports to screen candidates for hiring positions without their knowledge. 
Hird said the technologies are being used by companies for other types of employee evaluation or automations that have eliminated jobs. 
Tom Chapman, speaking on behalf of the Iowa Catholic Conference, said the group was leaning toward supporting the bill and noted that the challenge with AI is “not really so much technological, but anthropological.” 
“It’s a matter of protecting human identity and authentic relationships,” Chapman said. “When we turn over decision making, perhaps, to AI, creativity, I think it risks diminishing our own agency, our own imagination and our own personal responsibility.” 
Sen. Liz Bennett, D-Cedar Rapids, who served on the committee and signed off on the bill, said AI models can often misinterpret data, hallucinate or make faulty inferences, depending on how they are trained. 
“End users don’t always understand this, so that really can produce a situation where a machine is limiting somebody’s opportunity, or making the decision to fire somebody, and I think we need to keep humans in the loop,” Bennett said.
Other groups commented that some of the broad definitions in the bill could limit a state agency’s ability to utilize some of the efficiencies provided by artificial intelligence. 
Andrew Ritland, speaking on behalf of the Mahaska County attorney’s office, pointed to language in the bill that stipulated a state agency could not “transfer existing duties or functions performed by state agency employees to an artificial intelligence system.” Ritland said the language was “short sighted.” 
“AI is a tool just like any other, and if there is a desire for government to be more efficient, run leaner and ultimately save the taxpayers money, using artificial intelligence systems to assume duties, maybe data compilation or other duties, is a labor saving measure,” Ritland said. 
McClintock, who introduced the bill, said he would go ahead and move it forward, with the understanding that lawmakers would do some work to address the concerns raised before bringing it to the committee. 
“AI is not going away,” McClintock said. “It’s only going to continue to be brought forth in technology… so we’ll just keep addressing it. We can improve this bill and we certainly will.”

(Photo by Pam Hergett/U.S. Forest Service)The Wild Fish Conservancy’s use of the Equal Access to Justice Act is alarming the small-boat fishermen who fought the conservancy’s lawsuit that sought to close the Southeast Alaska chinook troll fishery to preserve migratory chinook as prey for the endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales that feed in waters near Puget Sound.
WFC, a membership-based nonprofit with offices in Duvall, Washington, filed that lawsuit against the National Marine Fisheries Service in U.S. District Court in Washington in 2020. For months in 2023, a District Court order in the case threatened to close the summer and winter chinook troll fishery in Southeast Alaska.
Ultimately, an appeals court ruling allowed the Southeast troll fishery to continue as usual while NMFS updated the scientific documentation it uses to authorize the fishery.
This past November a U.S. District Court judge ordered the federal government to pay $1.6 million in attorney fees to WFC to cover its costs in its years-long lawsuit, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act and the Equal Access to Justice Act.
“It’s egregious to see WFC reimbursed for its costs,” said Tyler Emerson, treasurer of the Alaska Trollers Association, which intervened as a defendant in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit “caused an incredible amount of anxiety up and down the coastline,” Sitka fisherman Jeff Farvour said. “There’s financial impacts, and emotional or mental impacts, to Southeast fishermen and communities.”
Southeast communities contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to support NMFS and the other defendants in the lawsuit, in defense of the hook-and-line chinook fishery in their coastal waters.
The conservancy “largely lost the case,” Farvour said. “Yet they demanded $2.3 million, and were awarded over $1.6 million.”
“The ones who they attacked — small rural Southeast Alaska communities, sustainable small-boat fisheries, tribes, the State of Alaska and others — are left paying their own bills with no recourse to cover their costs,” Farvour said. “It’s unbelievable that the Equal Access to Justice Act can be used this way.”
The justice act was enacted in 1980 with the intent of allowing veterans, social security beneficiaries, and other plaintiffs with limited income to seek attorney fees in a public interest lawsuit against the federal government, regardless of whether they were the prevailing party in the lawsuit.
Over the years, environmental groups have advanced their missions by utilizing their EAJA rights in suing the federal government over its protections for endangered species and their habitats.
For years members of Congress, concerned by what they see as abuses of EAJA by some plaintiffs, have sought ways to reform the law. In December, the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee held an oversight hearing “examining how environmental non-governmental organizations abuse the Equal Access to Justice Act.”
As background for the hearing, the committee stated that “legal actions by NGOs (non-governmental organizations) force federal land management agencies to waste significant amounts of their budgets and time on litigation and decision reversals. This detracts from their responsibilities to manage and protect our natural resources.”
Emma Helverson, executive director of the Wild Fish Conservancy, said in an email to the Sentinel that EAJA “ensures that individuals and nonprofit organizations can hold the federal government accountable to the law.”
“EAJA is critically important to ensuring the public has a meaningful voice in the courts,” Helverson said. “Without it, many unlawful government actions would never be reviewed.”
Orca/chinook lawsuit
The Wild Fish Conservancy’s 2020 lawsuit argued that federal fisheries managers failed to address how the Southeast Alaska troll fishery that intercepts migratory chinook salmon could harm endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales that feed in waters near Puget Sound and harm specific chinook populations that spawn in Washington and Oregon rivers.
In May of 2023, a U.S. District Court judge threatened to close the Southeast Alaska troll fishery for chinook by vacating the NMFS “incidental take statement” that authorized the fishery despite its potential effect on those species.
In late June of 2023 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted a last-minute stay in the case, allowing the summer fishery to open as scheduled on July 1, while providing time for the NMFS to craft new scientific documentation authorizing the fishery.
In August 2024, an appeals court panel reversed the District Court judge’s decision from May 2023 that would have effectively shut down the regional, small-boat fishery in Southeast Alaska. The appeals court ruled in favor of the federal and state fishery managers whose management had been challenged by the WFC lawsuit.
In late 2024 NMFS said it had finished revamping its scientific documentation for the state-managed fishery to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act.
Southeast fishing communities rallied funding and support for NMFS throughout the lawsuit. Both the State of Alaska and the Alaska Trollers Association intervened as defendants, and ATA also launched a legal defense fund.
Alaska’s Congressional Delegation, and a coalition of Southeast tribal governments weighed in via amicus curiae briefs.
Emerson said that ATA raised about $217,000 in support of the defense, about two thirds of which came from municipal governments, tribal governments, hatchery organizations, members of the processing sector, other fishery gear groups, and the business community, and a third of which came from individuals.
He said other organizations contributed significant funds, and that the state and federal governments incurred the greatest costs.
NMFS Alaska Region Administrator Jon Kurland said the federal agency does not, as a matter of course, keep track of the costs involved with fighting lawsuits such as WFC’s.
$1.6 million award to Wild Fish Conservancy
In 2024, WFC filed a motion in the case requesting a $2.3 million award for the attorneys’ fees and costs it incurred in suing the federal government.
WFC’s $2.3 million bill cited the cost of 4,686 hours of casework — at hourly rates between $260 and $750 — by law firm Kampmeier & Knutsen partners and staff, and 320 hours of work by other legal counsel from 2020 through late 2025.
Defendants argued that those rates were “inflated,” and asked the court to reduce the award by 25%.
District Court Judge Richard A. Jones decided in a Nov. 21 order that WFC is entitled to $1.6 million in attorneys’ fees, and an additional $79,000 in other costs.
Jones’ order followed with a court report that determined the award of more than $1.6 million is appropriate because WFC had “some degree of success on the merits” of its case.
Kurland, of NMFS, said that, when a court orders an award for attorneys’ fees and costs, “it either comes from (federal) agency funds, or from the Department of Justice’s judgement fund,” which pays settlements and judgements in lawsuits against the government.
Kurland said that the DOJ will make a final determination on whether WFC’s award is paid by the judgement fund or by NMFS.
“It’s a narrow issue at this point,” Kurland said. “The court has rendered that judgement, so now it’s just how we fulfill our obligations to the courts.”
Emerson said that the ruling awarding WFC’s legal fees “is frustrating for ATA and our fleet.”
“Taxpayers will now bear the burden of reimbursing $1.6 million in legal costs,” Emerson said.
He noted that WFC operates on annual revenues of about $2 million; some of that comes from federal grant funding.
The award of attorneys’ fees and other costs to WFC “encourages more lawsuits that target responsible fishing communities with limited resources, instead of focusing efforts on actual conservation solutions such as addressing pollution and habitat loss,” Emerson said.
Sitka fisherman Mark Holst said that “it’s a clear abuse of our justice system that an environmental group can hire professional lawyers and litigators, get reimbursed, and continue their fight while us hardworking fishermen get stuck with a bill.”
Helverson said that WFC “does not profit from this or any litigation brought to enforce federal law.”
“The vast majority of the reimbursement is paid directly to our attorneys, with WFC only receiving reimbursement for costs we previously paid out of pocket,” Helverson said. “In this case, that is for costs paid to expert witnesses. All fee requests are submitted to, reviewed by, and approved by the court.”
WFC’s Endangered Species Act petition and second lawsuit 
While its orca/chinook suit that threatened the Southeast Alaska troll fishery was ongoing, WFC in early 2024 filed a petition asking NMFS to list chinook as threatened or endangered across the Gulf of Alaska.
If approved, this listing would entitle NMFS to take over management control from the state for any Alaska chinook stocks listed under the Endangered Species Act, as well as their habitats; in general, federal regulations prohibit harvest of fish stocks listed under the ESA, as well as actions that would degrade their critical habitat.
In May of 2024 NMFS accepted the petition for a full review by issuing a 90-day finding that listing some Gulf of Alaska chinook stocks “may be warranted.”
A team of NMFS scientists had until January of 2025 to make a 12-month finding on whether an “endangered” listing is warranted for one or more of the Gulf of Alaska chinook stocks.
NMFS did not meet that deadline, so in May of 2025, WFC filed a new lawsuit against the National Marine Fisheries Service over its failure to provide a timely response to the conservancy’s petition.
As of today, a year after the deadline, NMFS has not released its finding on the ESA listing petition.
Kurland said that the parties in the case are working to find a way forward.
“There have been discussions ongoing between the Department of Justice and the plaintiffs regarding the schedule for proceeding in the case,” Kurland said.
In the ongoing lawsuit regarding the ESA petition deadline, WFC is again requesting a court-ordered EAJA award from the federal government to cover its legal fees.

CRISPR approach targets NRF2 “master switch,” with potential to reopen treatment options for aggressive tumors
 
WILMINGTON, Del. — Researchers at ChristianaCare’s Gene Editing Institute say they have taken an important step toward tackling one of cancer care’s hardest problems: when chemotherapy stops working.
In new findings published in Molecular Therapy: Oncology, the team reported that CRISPR gene editing can disrupt a key resistance-driving gene — known as NRF2 — in head and neck cancer cells, restoring the tumors’ sensitivity to standard chemotherapy in laboratory testing.
“Our goal was to break through the wall of drug resistance that so many patients face,” said Natalia Rivera-Torres, Ph.D., the study’s lead author. By precisely editing the NRF2 gene, she said, researchers aim to “make cancer cells vulnerable again to standard treatments,” potentially improving outcomes and quality of life.
Why drug resistance matters
Head and neck cancers remain a major global health burden and are among the most common cancers worldwide. Even with advances in surgery, chemotherapy, targeted drugs and immunotherapy, many patients eventually face tumors that no longer respond to treatment — leaving fewer options and poorer odds.
ChristianaCare’s team focused on NRF2 because it functions like a cellular “stress response” master switch. When NRF2 is overactive, cancer cells can better survive the damage that chemotherapy is meant to cause — fueling both tumor growth and treatment resistance.
Instead of trying to block a single protein downstream, the researchers pursued a more direct approach: disabling the gene itself using CRISPR, a tool that can cut DNA at precise locations.
The key finding: where CRISPR cuts can determine success
One of the study’s central insights was that the exact CRISPR target site inside the NRF2 gene matters.
The strongest results came when researchers targeted exon 4, a region tied to a critical part of the NRF2 protein. Editing exon 4 reduced NRF2 levels by about 90% and made cancer cells significantly more sensitive to chemotherapy, ChristianaCare said. Targeting exon 2 also disrupted the gene, but produced weaker results.
The team also reported that a phenomenon called exon skipping — where cells “splice” genetic instructions in unexpected ways after an edit — can shape how well a gene-editing strategy performs. That finding, researchers said, underscores the need for careful design and testing as CRISPR-based therapies move forward.
Beyond head and neck cancer
ChristianaCare said the approach worked not only in head and neck cancer cells, but also in esophageal cancer cells — raising the possibility of a broader platform for drug-resistant solid tumors where NRF2 is high.
“This is more than just a single experiment,” said Eric Kmiec, Ph.D., director of the Gene Editing Institute and senior author of the study. “We are building a platform that can be adapted to different cancers,” he said, pointing to earlier work in lung cancer that helped motivate the strategy.
What happens next — and what patients should know now
The findings are preclinical — meaning they are not yet a treatment available in doctors’ offices. The next major challenge is delivery: getting gene-editing tools safely and effectively to tumors in the body, while minimizing off-target effects and other risks.
ChristianaCare said its researchers are now focused on identifying the safest delivery methods and exploring whether gene editing could allow patients to achieve better results with lower doses of standard treatments — potentially reducing side effects.
“Drug resistance is one of the biggest challenges in cancer care,” Rivera-Torres said. “If we can overcome it with gene editing, we could give patients more time, better quality of life and a renewed sense of hope.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/150812aCC-22375-800x601-1.jpg,,,2026-01-27 15:57:39.362902

Hillman Frazier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/27/hillman-frazier-mississippi-child-care/,"Child care workers and children, parents and legislators stressed the need to protect access to child care during the Child Care Matters: Keep Mississippi Working press conference held at the state Capitol, Thursday, April 24, 2025.","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future.

Mississippi is facing a child care crisis.
Those directly impacted –  our kids, working parents and day care providers – are calling on the state to utilize existing state and federal Temporary Aid for Needy Families funds to fill the gap and ensure all eligible working families have access to child care.
As a state senator proudly representing the hard-working families of Hinds County, I’m joining them in that call.
The crisis is coming from many directions. As a result of expired pandemic funds, nearly 20,000 families in Mississippi are now on a growing wait list for child care vouchers – coupons that make child care affordable for low-income working parents. Then there’s President Donald Trump’s federal budget bill, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which pays for trillions of dollars in tax cuts to billionaires and corporations by cutting Medicaid and food assistance for hundreds and thousands of our neighbors. And the bill’s child care provisions do little to help the crisis families face.
Sen. Hillman Frazier Credit: Courtesy photo
On top of all of that, this year the federal government announced a federal funding freeze, paired with a notice that it was rescinding rules permitting states to pay providers without verifying attendance logs. All of this has added to the confusion and stress of Mississippi’s child care providers, and the parents who depend on them.
But these are not just numbers, statistics, legislative or executive actions. These are thousands of working families without vouchers trying to piece together haphazard child care with family members, or going into debt with their child care providers.
Child care providers carry the burden too, eating the cost and risking closure. Child care providers are small business owners and  have monthly obligations that they must meet.
I recently had an opportunity to tour the Agape Christian Academy World Day Care in my district and learned firsthand the challenges the child care center is facing daily. The owner, Cantrell Keyes, told me that her center has the capacity to serve 75 students, but because of the cut in vouchers her center is now serving only 22 students.
Her center once received $23,00 per month in child care vouchers, but is now receiving $5,000 a month. Her overhead is the same. This has put stress on her center to make payroll and to keep the center open to provide quality child care to these families.
Many parents are facing a dilemma of whether to work or to stay home with their children because they cannot afford to pay for quality child care. Leaving their child at home unattended is not an option.
I spoke with Sharon Watson, a single parent who works in the private sector. As a result of the voucher crisis, her payment for child care went from $60 a week to $200 a week. That limits what she can provide for her child. She said that she is thankful that Cantrell Keyes at Agape Christian Academy World Day Care understands her circumstances and is working with her to continue providing the quality care that her child is receiving.
Cutting off or slowing child care funding worsens the state’s affordability crisis, with disastrous impacts for parents, children, workers and the economy.
It just takes one day without child care for a parent to lose a  job, and only a few weeks without funding for a child care provider to shut its doors for good. According to a recent survey by the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, 170 licensed child care centers in the state closed in 2025. That’s the highest number in nearly a decade. But Mississippi officials have the power and the money to act. 
It just so happens that the Mississippi Department of Human Services has $156 million in stockpiled federal TANF funds that can be used to address the child care voucher wait list and ensure thousands of families get the child care they need, allowing providers to keep doing their invaluable work. Using part of the $156 million can provide immediate relief.
I was encouraged to see Mississippi Human Services Director Bob Anderson commit to pursuing a solution to address this crisis at a state Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee meeting on Jan. 21. He was also open to receiving $60 million in state appropriations to address this crisis.
With the cost of care for one child averaging $5,000-$7,000 a year and not enough child care for families who need it, working families are finding it harder and harder to access care they can afford. Mississippi should learn from other states like New Mexico, which recently made child care free for everyone.
In this crisis, it is essential the state acts swiftly. Families and day care providers alike are counting on us. And in the future, we need a new approach to avoid a crisis like this from happening again.
This is possible, if we work together and prioritize the prosperity of working families in our great state.

Formerly Meet Me at The Well, the group says the new name better reflects survivor needs as Delaware ranks among top states by reported trafficking rate and leaders plan a statewide awareness summit.
 
WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware’s best-known survivor-support nonprofit for human trafficking is changing its name, but leaders say the mission remains the same: helping people who have been exploited rebuild stable, independent lives — and reminding Delawareans that trafficking is often a local, hidden crime, not the dramatic “white van” scenario many imagine.
The organization formerly registered as Meet Me at The Well, founded in 2014, has rebranded as the Delaware Coalition for Human Trafficking Survivors (DCFHTS), according to an announcement dated Jan. 27, 2026. The group will remain faith-based and survivor-centered, providing trauma-informed support, education and advocacy under Executive Director Sandra Brisiel and a governing board led by President Marcia Ferranto.
“The leadership team at DCFHTS is energized about our name change, as it is more directly aligned with survivors’ needs and the needs of the state,” Ferranto said in the announcement.
Brisiel said the coalition’s updated branding and programs are aimed at expanding impact. “Our new branding and upcoming programs are poised to make a great impact on our mission to provide safe spaces and supportive pathways toward healing, self-sufficiency, and reintegration into the community,” she said.
A Delaware problem — often closer than people think
While trafficking is notoriously underreported, available indicators show Delaware continues to see steady case activity.   According to World Population Review, Delaware ranked 10th in the nation for Human Trafficking in 2024 at a rate of 3.3 persons/100,000 individuals.
The National Human Trafficking Hotline reported 32 cases identified in Delaware in 2024, involving 61 victims. Using the U.S. Census Bureau’s July 1, 2024 population estimate for Delaware (1,051,917), that’s roughly 3.0 identified cases per 100,000 residents — a reminder, advocates say, that Delaware’s small size does not mean the problem is small.
Separately, Delaware’s Anti-Trafficking Action Council annual report describes how the state is trying to identify risk earlier — especially among youth. In calendar year 2024, the Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families reported 92 youth screened at intake using the CSE-IT tool, including 37 flagged as a “clear concern” and 27 as a “possible concern” for trafficking — 64 youth in total who raised significant red flags at the screening stage.
Advocates caution that hotline and screening figures don’t capture the full picture. Some victims never report, some are misidentified, and many cases involve coercion that doesn’t look like force from the outside.
Not kidnapping — more often grooming, coercion, and vulnerability
National experts have spent years trying to correct a major misconception: that trafficking typically starts with a stranger kidnapping someone.
Polaris, which operates the National Human Trafficking Hotline, says the “most pervasive myth” is that trafficking usually involves kidnapping or physical restraint. In reality, many traffickers rely on psychological control — manipulation, isolation, threats, debt, and intimidation. Federal researchers at the Government Accountability Office have warned that these misperceptions can reduce awareness and make it harder for communities to recognize victims and support survivors.
In Delaware, service providers say common risk factors often include housing instability, substance-use disorder, prior abuse, untreated trauma, and young people who are isolated from stable support systems. Recruitment and control can also happen online, including through social media and dating apps.
A global industry built on repeat exploitation
Human trafficking is not only a local public-safety issue — it’s also driven by enormous profits.
A 2024 International Labour Organization report estimates forced labor in the private economy generates about $236 billion per year in illegal profits worldwide. Advocates often explain the incentive this way: unlike drugs, which are sold once and consumed, a person can be exploited repeatedly for labor or commercial sex.
The scale is also global. The ILO and partners estimate 50 million people were living in modern slavery in 2021, including forced labor and forced marriage.
What Meet Me at The Well did — and what the coalition says it will keep doing
Meet Me at The Well became known in Delaware for a model that emphasized long-term aftercare, not just emergency intervention — a gap that survivors and advocates say is often the hardest part of recovery.
According to the organization’s description of its work, core supports have included:


Ongoing survivor support, including mentoring, case management and life-skills coaching


Help secure stable housing and basic needs, such as transportation and employment pathways


Trauma-informed services are designed around long-term recovery


Community education for schools, churches, civic groups and service providers


Collaboration with state partners and allied agencies


That survivor-centered approach remains central to the newly named coalition, leadership said in the rebrand announcement.
Next major public event: a statewide summit planned for 2027
DCFHTS also announced plans to host what it described as Delaware’s inaugural Human Trafficking Awareness, Prevention, and Action Summit — including an invitation-only executive roundtable — on Oct. 1–2, 2027, at the Hyatt Place in Dewey Beach. The event is expected to include national experts and local authorities, with tracks for survivors, law enforcement, mental health professionals, direct service workers, and medical providers.
If you suspect trafficking — where to get help
Advocates stress that trafficking is about force, fraud or coercion used to compel labor or commercial sex — and that minors involved in commercial sex are treated as trafficking victims under U.S. law.

(Photo courtesy LA DOTD)Extreme cold has led to the deaths of five more people in Louisiana, bringing the total number of fatalities state officials are attributing to this week’s winter weather to eight.
The Louisiana Department of Health reported two weather-related deaths each in DeSoto and Sabine parishes, and a single incident in Franklin Parish.
In DeSoto Parish,  the coroner confirmed a 79-year-old woman died of hypoxia after her electric-powered oxygen concentrator failed during a power outage. A 46-year-old man  died in a automobile accident while driving on an icy road.
The Sabine Parish coroner has confirmed the deaths of a 62-year-old man and a 59-year-old women who both died in their homes of suspected hypothermia after a power outage.
Hypothermia is also being blamed for the death of a 78-year-old woman in Franklin Parish.
Power restoration was still in progress early Tuesday afternoon for some 90,000 utility customers in Louisiana, according to FindEnergy.com. The outages are largely concentrated in Northeast Louisiana but span across the state to the Toledo Bend-Sabine River area.
The problem is particularly acute in East Carroll Parish where 95% of its nearly 3,400 Entergy Louisiana customers were still without service as of 1:30 p.m. Tuesday. Temperatures are expected to remain at or near the freezing mark for next two days before the next Arctic front arrives before the weekend and brings another blast of cold weather.
Together Louisiana, a coalition of civic and religious organizations, describes the situation in East Carroll, the state’s poorest parish with a per capital median income of less than $17,000, as a “potential humanitarian emergency.”
“Residents report widespread loss of water service and blocked roads, leaving some households unable to evacuate or reach medical care,” Together Louisiana said in a news release. “For families who rely on electricity to power ventilators, oxygen, feeding tubes, and other medical devices, the situation is life-threatening.”
The group has worked with Delta Interfaith to assess the emergency needs of approximately 3,000 households in East Carroll Parish and  coordinating response efforts with other organizations. They have deployed mobile solar-powered and battery- powered trailers to support warming centers and critical facilities. Delta Interfaith also plans to deliver portable battery systems to households with medical devices that need power.
More information is available on the East Carroll efforts at deltainterfaith.org.
The highest number of outages is in Ouachita Parish, where more than 45,000 customers lacked electricity Tuesday afternoon. Local officials said snapped utility poles, downed lines and fallen trees is slowing the progress of utility restoration crews in some areas, KNOE-TV reported.
Gov. Jeff Landry traveled to Ouachita to inspect the damage and told reporters utility companies have said they anticipate repowering roughly 90% of their customers by Thursday.
Entergy Louisiana still had the most outages in its delivery footprint with just under 75,000 customers powerless as of 2 p.m., followed by Southwestern Electric Power Co. at nearly 10,500, CLECO Power with 2,000 and Concordia Power with 1,060. No other power provider reported more than 70 outages in their respective service areas.
Icy roads also continue to limit travel across northern Louisiana. Hundreds of truckers were stopped along sections of Interstate 20, though the governor said traffic was once again moving.

Kelly Ayotte nominated Associate Justice of the Superior Court Daniel Will to serve on the state Supreme Court Tuesday, her second nomination to the high court since taking office last year. Will has served on the superior court since 2021, and as the associate justice of that court has presided over superior court cases […]","Associate Justice of the Superior Court Daniel Will, whom Gov. Kelly Ayotte nominated to the state Supreme Court, Jan. 27, 2026. (Photo courtesy of governor's office)Gov. Kelly Ayotte nominated Associate Justice of the Superior Court Daniel Will to serve on the state Supreme Court Tuesday, her second nomination to the high court since taking office last year.
Will has served on the superior court since 2021, and as the associate justice of that court has presided over superior court cases across the state. 
Before that, he worked as a business and commercial litigator at Devine Millimet in Manchester. And in 2018, then-Gov. Chris Sununu appointed Will to be the state’s solicitor general, the first person to hold that role.
“He has the qualifications, integrity, and commitment to public service Granite Staters expect in a Supreme Court Justice, and I am confident he will uphold the rule of law and our Constitution,” Ayotte said in a statement.
As solicitor general, Will worked within the Attorney General’s Office and had a lot of interaction with the state Supreme Court. That included: representing the state in all criminal appeals in the state Supreme Court and federal court; reviewing cases decided against the state and deciding whether to appeal; representing the executive branch before the Supreme Court; and filing amicus curiae briefs on behalf of the state. 
Rep. Robert Lynn, a Windham Republican and a former chief justice of the Supreme Court, praised Will in a statement and said he is “committed to fairness and the rule of law, and he has a clear understanding of the constitutional limits of judicial authority.” 
“I think he will just be a fantastic justice: He’s very smart, hard working, fair minded, and I think a principled conservative,” Lynn said in an interview Tuesday. 
If confirmed to the Supreme Court by the Executive Council, Will’s time as solicitor general could raise questions about recusal in some future cases.
For instance, before becoming a judge in August 2021, Will represented the state at the Supreme Court in arguing against a major school funding lawsuit, Contoocook Valley School District v. State of New Hampshire. While the Supreme Court issued a final opinion in that case in July 2025, ruling that the state was not fulfilling its obligation to fund an adequate education, a similar lawsuit, Rand v. State of New Hampshire, is likely to come before the Supreme Court in the next year. 
Though the two lawsuits deal with similar legal issues, the Rand lawsuit was filed in June 2022, nearly a year after Will left as solicitor general. And there is precedent in favor of Will not recusing himself in that case: Supreme Court Chief Justice Gordon MacDonald — the former attorney general — recused himself in the July 2025 ConVal decision because of his past role defending the state from that lawsuit, but did not recuse himself from a June 2025 decision in the Rand case because it was filed after he left the Attorney General’s Office. 
Under Supreme Court rules, justices make their own determinations over whether to recuse from hearing or ruling on cases.
As solicitor general, Will also led the state’s arguments against releasing the “Laurie List” — the state’s exculpatory evidence schedule that lists state and local police officers with incidents in their past that could impugn their credibility on the witness stand; in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the list is not confidential and is subject to the right-to-know law. But litigation over whether officers should be included or excluded from that last has continued; in November, the court ruled against a former Concord police officer who argued she should be excluded because she no longer works in law enforcement and her alleged conduct happened too far in the past. 
And as solicitor general, Will also represented Sununu against a lawsuit challenging the governor’s state of emergency called at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. That declaration allowed the executive branch to issue orders shutting down certain businesses and to determine the use of federal emergency relief funds without the Legislature. 
That final role could present a snag in Will’s nomination process; in 2021, Republican Councilor David Wheeler, of Milford, was the sole vote against Will’s appointment to the superior court after objecting to his work defending the emergency order. 
In an interview Tuesday, Wheeler said he still has concerns over Will’s past defense of that emergency order — as well as his opposition to the release of the Laurie List — and will likely be opposing Will’s nomination.
The Executive Council will hold a hearing in the coming weeks; a date has not yet been determined.
If approved, Will would fill an upcoming vacancy left by Associate Justice Anna Barbara Hantz Marconi, who is retiring in February. 
Hantz Marconi was put on administrative leave from the court from July 2024 to October 2025, after she was charged with two Class B felonies after allegedly attempting to interfere with the state’s criminal investigation into her husband, former New Hampshire Port Authority Director Geno Marconi. 
Hantz Marconi was allowed to return to the court in October after pleading guilty to a single charge of criminal solicitation and paying a $1,200 fine; the state’s Attorney General’s Office dropped the other charges as part of the plea deal. But the associate justice turns 70 in February — the mandatory retirement age for New Hampshire judges. 
In September, the Executive Council approved Ayotte’s first nominee to the Supreme Court, Bryan Gould, 4-1, replacing Justice James Bassett, who retired ahead of turning 70. At the time, Republican councilors praised Gould, a former attorney with Cleveland, Waters and Bass in Concord for his pledges of neutrality if confirmed, while Democratic Councilor Karen Liot Hill raised concerns about whether his conservative background meant he might rule against school funding precedents, and voted no. 
In a statement accompanying Ayotte’s announcement Tuesday, Will made a similar promise to take a non-ideological approach to the court.
“Granite Staters expect fair, impartial decisions from their Supreme Court,” he said. “If confirmed, I will strive each day to meet that expectation, uphold the rule of law, and help resolve disputes fairly and expeditiously.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Daniel-Will.png,,,2026-01-27 15:57:39.362902

Volunteers weaved between vehicles and raindrops, dodging exhaust fumes, to provide drivers with a menu to fill out. The list included protein options, canned, bagged and boxed foods, frozen fruit and soup, milk, eggs, deli meat, snacks, bread and coffee. 
Behind the wheel of her old pickup truck, Angela Nelson circled the choices for her family of nine, stopping at the very last option, a line where she could write her “one wish list item.”
On Nov. 7, she asked for a birthday cake for her son.
At Interchurch Food Pantry of Johnson County, birthday cake is possible because of an intricate system the pantry calls “food rescue.” Rescuing food allows Executive Director Carol Phipps and her team not only to keep Central Indiana residents nourished and fed but also supplied with a little joy in the form of a sweet treat.

This article was produced through the Statehouse Reporting Project, a collaborative effort by collegiate journalism programs across the country.

This is food pantry resilience, honed over decades of government shutdowns, swings in the economy, fluctuations in donors and funding and volunteers, and changes in federal food support—and in this way, the Interchurch Food Pantry is not unique. 
Food pantries in Indiana and across the country look to local grocers, college students, churches, K-12 schools, restaurants and bakeries for donations of food, or grow their own on rooftop gardens, or spend hours writing grant requests to stay afloat.
Experts say this is how it has to be.
“Any sector you’re in, we are trying to figure out how to piece multiple streams of resources together to meet ever-growing needs,” said Chris Bernard, president and CEO of Hunger Free Oklahoma. “You need an array of resources to rely on because no single one can really meet that total demand. … It helps create stability, rather than up and down chaos, which is much harder to manage when you’re trying to meet basic needs.”
He added that benevolent support can vary depending on the political climate.
“When it’s a hot-button issue, you might have as many volunteers as you can handle and more. But when the public’s attention gets focused somewhere else, you might be struggling,” Bernard said. “The folks who do this, do it well. They understand logistics and they understand how to leverage resources.”
Wealth inequality in New Mexico
Data collected by the New Mexico Department of Health found that 350,000 people face food insecurity in the state, with one-third of them children, according to Feeding America. Map the Meal Gap, another initiative by Feeding America, found that New Mexico has the seventh-highest hunger rate in the nation. 
While metropolitan areas like Albuquerque offer residents more access to resources, rural areas face totally different challenges than many other regions of the nation.

Organizations in New Mexico face the unique challenge of dispersing food over a large, mostly rural state with small communities tucked away in mountains, deserts and plains. These rural areas are also where disparities emerge.
Despite these factors, New Mexico is also home to some of the wealthiest communities in the country. Extractive industries like nuclear, oil and gas have created a divide in the state. For example, Los Alamos County, home to Los Alamos National Laboratory, ranks in the top 25 richest counties in the nation according to Google’s Data Commons report. It also has the lowest rate of hunger, with the Los Alamos Food Depot stating that 8.2% of the county is food insecure. This is well below the 16.6% state average from Map the Meal Gap. On the opposite end of the spectrum, McKinley and Luna counties face rates of food insecurity of 23%, another Map the Meal Gap statistic.
Organizations large and small have to work differently from one another to feed people in their areas.
La Mesa Presbyterian Church helps residents of the International District of Albuquerque through its pantry, which sources from a variety of places. The pantry feeds over 400 people a month. Coordinator Roxie Bradley said it gets regular donations from the local food bank, Road Runner Food Bank, as well as from food rescue partners.
Businesses in the area, like Einstein’s Bagels, donate food that otherwise would have been thrown away. But the pantry sometimes lacks in-demand items like canned chicken, for which the church turns to its congregation members to purchase or donate to fill these food needs.
“The congregation has been so supportive,” Bradley said. “One month, we’ll have them donate chicken. Another month, we might have them donate peanut butter.”
Bradley said this direction motivates people to donate since they have clarity in what the pantry needs. The pantry also asks members for monetary donations and for smaller items they may have on hand, like unused utensils from take-out, travel-sized toiletries and plastic bags.
The pantry doesn’t give out pre-made bags of food but allows people to browse for what they want.
“They can choose from whatever’s on the shelf,” Bradley said. “So, if you have a food allergy, or if you’re allergic to something, don’t take it. Or if you don’t like tuna, don’t take tuna.”
To ensure everyone gets food, they ask people to come once a week, but they don’t turn away people who have to come more often. In its 20 years of serving the community, La Mesa Presbyterian has only had to close once due to low stock. 
“Somedays, I get worried about what we’re doing and if we have enough, but it all works out,” Bradley said. “It’s like the loaves and the fishes, everyone somehow gets enough.”
McKinley and Cibola counties in western New Mexico, which include tribal lands like the Navajo Nation and several Pueblos, are, according to Data Commons, among the poorest counties in the state for per-capita personal income. As a result, these counties face some of the most extreme rates of food insecurity.
The Community Pantry serves over 5,000 families a month and operates two facilities in Gallup and Grants as well as several mobile distribution sites on Navajo and Pueblo land, making them one of the largest food assistance organizations in the area.
“The reservation lands are desert,” said Alice Perez, executive director and CEO of the Community Pantry. “There’s no running water, especially back then [when the pantry started], and there was very little electricity. So self-preservation wasn’t necessarily attainable, and it’s still not to this day.”
Perez said the Community Pantry gets 70% of its support from monetary donations, specifically through grant writing and county and foundation funding. It also does some community fundraising, but can’t fully rely on it.
“Fundraising right here is limited,” Perez said. “It’s hard to pull from the community members who are already economically stressed and ask them to give more money.”
The Community Pantry pairs these funds with existing programs, like the Commodity Supplemental Food Program and the Emergency Food Assistance Program, to enhance the food it distributes. When possible, the pantry also partners with an organization in Arizona to distribute water to households that don’t have access. But this water can be hard to get and is in high demand.
“The last one we did, and it was an entire semi load full, that’s almost all gone.” Perez said. “It doesn’t take long to not have water here.”
With federal funding cuts, the Community Pantry had to consolidate. It used to run 14 mobile distribution sites, but now it runs nine. Still, it’s determined to feed the community through collaborative efforts.
“We’re all in the storm together, but we all ride in different boats. Some people have big boats, some people have row boats,” Perez said. “That’s why it’s so important for communities to gather together and collaborate so that we’re not limiting our own resources.”
Increasing needs in Indiana

In Indiana, Feeding America reported that one in seven people face hunger. The state as a whole, according to Gleaners, has a 12.6% food insecurity rate, with 299,260 Hoosiers regularly going hungry, according to Gleaners Food Bank. 
In Marion County, the least rural part of the state, SNAP provides half of the meals for people who utilize food benefits according to Indy Hunger Network. On top of that, half of the county’s residents also told Indy Hunger Network they were facing food insecurity in a 2025 survey.
Interchurch Food Pantry of Johnson County, which is located just outside of Marion County, was serving about 1,000 households per week as of September, a 21% increase over last year.
The pantry helps families like Nelson, who visit for groceries and even sweet treats like a birthday cake. 
As demand rises, the pantry has observed a noticeable lull in supply from Gleaners Food Bank, the food bank where Interchurch receives some commodities through The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). 
In 2024, the pantry received 10,000 to 41,000 pounds of food each month from Gleaners. So far this year, it has maxed out at about 20,000 pounds. This is largely because TEFAP and other federal food assistance programs had their funding slashed by President Donald Trump’s administration this year.
Phipps said if government commodities completely went away, the pantry would lose about $500,000 worth of food per year. But she has remained optimistic. She is able to call on her decades-long experiences with food rescue initiatives, which help Interchurch keep up with demand, despite fewer goods from government-backed sources. 
This is exactly how her pantry does it:
Early in the morning, three days each week, two Interchurch volunteers will hop in a van and travel to schools in two central Indiana districts. Some mornings, they will make nearly 20 stops. 
These volunteers, according to Phipps, are strategic. They work with food service coordinators to organize precise pickup times similar to the way buses pick children up for school. 
The van drivers also have memorized routes they take to avoid morning traffic, which helps them stay on time. Phipps said drivers have to be on time because there is often cold or frozen food, like milk and or chicken nuggets, that schools don’t have room to store and need to be transported to the pantry in a timely manner.
While these routes are strategic and precise, pick-ups aren’t executed perfectly every day. Sometimes, a food service coordinator from a school will call Phipps if a driver is later than usual or seems to have missed their stop. Phipps then has to call the driver. In other cases, a school might not have anything for Interchurch to pick up, so the coordinator will contact Phipps, and she will relay to the driver not to stop there that day.
“There’s communication and things that have to happen to make this all work, but believe me, it is well worth it,” Phipps said. 
When the vans return to the pantry from their trip, they unload and another team of volunteers does the more tedious work of sorting and repackaging food to make sure it is up to health department standards so it is ready to be distributed. 
By the end of the day, Phipps said over 80% of food rescued from schools is sent to the homes of families who need it. 
Interchurch also rescues food from local grocery stores, which is where birthday cakes, cheesecakes, cupcakes and other sought-after sweets come from. 
Phipps said this type of food rescue takes a little more training for her volunteers.
Instead of driving a van, volunteers take box trucks so that they can transport larger quantities of food. Before a volunteer is able to do the grocery store route, they have to complete box truck training, which ensures they are able to back the truck into a loading dock and handle a larger vehicle.
Phipps only has six box truck drivers.
“Box truck drivers, we value them so much,” Phipps said. “I mean, these are all volunteers. These are not paid guys.”
The grocery pick-up route is similar to the school one. Each day of the week, there is a different driver who knows their specific route. They arrive at the pantry early in the morning and have to leave for their first run by 7 a.m. 
They rescue food until the truck is full. It holds 12 pallets, which is usually over 1,000 pounds of food per pallet. 
The driver takes the food back to the pantry, and a volunteer who is trained to use a forklift unloads the food from the truck. Then, usually, they have to go on another trip to stop by more stores.
Stopping at stores and schools helps Interchurch have more variety for Johnson County residents, but it also highlights the importance of the pantry having a variety of food sources.
The work of Interchurch benefits members of the community who do not even make the weekly trip to the food drive-thru. 
“I share with a lot of people. (The pantry) can’t reach everybody, you know, so I got a place in my garage where my neighbors and people that I know are in need, they can come over and get it,” Chris Catt said. 
Whether it is birthday cake, fresh produce, an Einstein’s bagel or Costco cheesecake, the creativity and resourcefulness of food pantries are touching more and more lives.
The Nov. 7 Interchurch drive-thru hosted Hoosiers who may have been furloughed or lost their SNAP benefits as a result of the government shutdown. One woman shed tears as a volunteer approached her with a menu.
She told him this was her first time using a pantry.
Rural and urban needs in Washington

In Washington state, food scarcity is rural and urban, and food pantries all over have been straining to meet spiking needs, exacerbated by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, new enrollment requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the recent government shutdown. In Seattle, local efforts are creative. They thread through city neighborhoods and often join forces.
At the base of a dorm on the University of Washington Seattle campus, the Husky Food Pantry distributes food to over 700 students and faculty each week.
Most might assume that if a student can afford to go to college, they can also afford groceries. The Husky Food Pantry proves that isn’t true
In fall 2022, the pantry saw about 300 unique visitors per week. In the 2024-25 school year, that number jumped to 600 visitors on average, and as of late October, the pantry had more than 730 visitors every week, according to River Elewski, the pantry’s student director.
The pantry buys the majority of its food in bulk from Costco with money gathered through its No Hungry Husky donation fund. Seven weeks into the fall quarter, the pantry had redistributed 16,156 pounds of food—rice, beans, milk, grab-and-go bars and more—according to internal data.
“We really do have limited capacity,” Elewski said. “We try to think about, ‘what are staples for folks that are going to stretch further?’”
An occasional pantry treat of fresh bread or cookies comes from Community Loaves, a nonprofit that connects folks baking at home with local pantries. 
A contract with the UW Farm brings in fresh, local-grown produce each week.
Another 2,429 pounds of food has come from university sources, such as unsold food from on-campus cafes, markets and dining halls and food-drive donations. Last June, when the majority of UW’s students moved out for the summer, the pantry ran a drive that brought in 1,230 pounds of food in a week.
South of downtown Seattle, the IDIC Filipino Senior and Family Services Center offers hot lunch and food bank services every Wednesday and Friday. Seniors eat, receive food supplies and participate in Zumba and bingo. 
But these services would not be possible without a series of fundraisers by program director Lanvin Andres. For example, he hosted a 54th anniversary gala last month to appeal to community members. 
“We show them what happens in our program,” Andres said. “We tell them stories from people who benefited from the program directly and hopefully compel them to support the program more permanently.” 
Andres said the food bank doesn’t just rely on fundraising, though. It has to look to a variety of sources, like in-kind donations from Seattle nonprofit Food Lifeline and private grants — supplemental funding that has become increasingly difficult to find.
“Nonprofits like us, and there’s tons of us, have to scour for limited sources,” he said. “So many nonprofits are currently in competition with each other. It’s somewhat of a rat race.” 
Just south of Seattle, faith-based organization Praisealujah hosts monthly drive-thru food giveaways in Burien and SeaTac. The organization has a food service the first Sunday of each month. November’s service drew 3,600 people. 
Praisealujah also receives in-kind donations from Food Lifeline but relies heavily on food rescue from grocery stores and local farms. 
“We send 23 trucks out a day,” said the Rev. Kelly Crow, Praisealujah founder. “We bring in about 800,000 to 900,000 pounds of food a month, and we have semi-trucks that rescue potatoes, onions and lettuce.” 
The trucks drop off supplies at a Praisealujah warehouse where workers sort the food that will be transported to giveaway locations in nearby cities Des Moines and Kent. 
“There’s more to it than just giving food, but building relationships,” he said. “You get to find out the other stuff that they need. We’re all humans, and we all need to be part of the solution.” 
In north Seattle, adjacent to the University of Washington campus, the University District Food Bank has been operating since 1983 and distributes roughly 4 million pounds of food each year to more than 116,000 households.
The food bank sidewalk often is full of people with food—some with paper bags stuffed full, others with soup still hot from the pantry’s cafe.
An elevator ride above the grocery, cafe and food storage spaces are dozens of beds of dirt. From donor money, the University District Food Bank opened its rooftop garden almost a decade ago. This year, volunteers and interns grew onions, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, nasturtiums and garlic and greens like spinach, chard, tatsoi, kale and romaine lettuce. Last year, they harvested 50 pounds of honey.
The 10,000 pounds of produce the garden contributes per year is a fraction of the food bank’s total distribution, but they’re not growing for poundage, executive director Joe Gruber said. It’s a project about building resilience, meeting wider customer needs, and doing the small, significant work that changes how people think about the food system as a whole.
“The work that we do is changing the food system that we live in,” Gruber said. “It is racist, it is classist. … If we’re intentional in how we engage in this work, how we talk about sustainability up here on the roof, … we can then bring this stuff downstairs and talk to customers about, ‘Hey, these tomatoes,’ or ‘here’s a plant start that we grew up on the roof—do you want it?’”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Client-food-basket-Santa-Fe-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 15:57:39.362902

In 2025, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Michael J. Page, a Des Moines surgeon specializing in colon and rectal surgery, with professional incompetence for failure to exercise in a substantial respect the degree of care which is ordinarily expected of the average physician.
The board also charged Page with unprofessional and unethical conduct by committing disruptive behavior through a pattern of contentious, threatening, or intractable behavior that could interfere with patient care or the effective functioning of health care staff.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The board has publicly disclosed no information as to where or when the alleged conduct took place that gave rise to the charges, but board records indicate the investigations into Page’s alleged conduct were initiated as the result of complaints filed in 2016 and 2017.
Recently, the board entered into a settlement agreement with Page. That agreement suggests the board charged Page only with unprofessional or unethical conduct, as it makes no mention of the accompanying charge of professional incompetence.
The settlement agreement states that the charge of unprofessional or unethical conduct is tied to allegations of “repeated and extreme rudeness to staff, patients, and families of patients,” and to allegations that in 2017, he failed to report that a hospital — which the board has not publicly named — suspended his privileges for 10 days due to his conduct.
Noting that Page is no longer working in a clinical setting and that his medical license expires on March 1, 2026, the board agreed to issue him a warning that imposes no penalties or restrictions on his license.
As part of the settlement, the board stipulated that should Page decide to return to practice, his license will be placed on probationary status, and his practice will be subject to monitoring.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Page for comment.
Court records show Page has been sued several times for alleged medical malpractice.
In 2011, he was accused of malpractice in a lawsuit by the estate of Christopher Hade. The case was settled out of court in 2014 with no indication as to whether a settlement was reached.
In 2013, Page and The Iowa Clinic were sued by John Clark of Dallas County, who alleged that Page was negligent in the surgical care he provided Clark. The malpractice case was later dismissed with no indication as to whether a settlement was reached.
In 2014, Page and the Iowa Clinic were sued by Shannon Miller of Dallas County, whose attorneys alleged Page was negligent when he failed to remove her ovaries during an operation “whose very purpose was the removal of her ovaries,” and when he later failed to disclose that information to Miller and allowed cysts and tumors to develop on her ovaries. Court records indicate the case went to trial in 2017 and the jury found that while Page was negligent, that negligence was not the cause of damages suffered by Miller.
In 2016, Page and The Iowa Clinic were sued by Joseph Tollari of Polk County, who alleged Page was negligent in that he failed to examine him or order a CAT scan before scheduling him for surgery. Those decisions, Tollari alleged, led to the removal of a large section of his colon, an intestinal leak that caused an infection, and additional surgeries. The malpractice case was later dismissed with no indication as to whether a settlement was reached.
In 2017, Page and the Iowa Digestive Disease Center were sued by the estate of Jessica May Spidell of Polk County. According to the malpractice lawsuit, Spidell was admitted to a hospital on Dec. 14, 2016, and Page scheduled her for colorectal surgery that was to take place on Dec. 28, 2016. Spidell died on Dec. 28, 2016, of a perforated colon, and her estate alleged Page was negligent in not scheduling the surgery sooner or transferring the case to another surgeon. The case was later dismissed with no indication as to whether a settlement was reached.

The commission extended a stay on a license for Yellowhammer Medical Dispensary, LLC, at its meeting Monday due to ongoing litigation. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission (AMCC) Monday extended a stay on a dispensary due to ongoing litigation. 
The Yellowhammer Medical Dispensary with locations planned in Birmingham, Owens and Demopolis, was the only dispensary that was not granted a license by the commission at its December meeting, due to a recommendation from an administrative law judge. Justin Aday, the commission’s general counsel, recommended on Monday that the stay be extended to the commission’s February meeting due to an appeal in ongoing litigation.
“I think it would be best to extend the stay on Yellowhammer Dispensaries until the appeal has been resolved,” Sam Blakemore, a pharmacist and commissioner, said.
 

Dispensary Locations:

CCS of Alabama, LLC

Montgomery, Bessemer and Talladega


GP6 Wellness, LLC

Birmingham, Athens and Attalla


RJK Holdings, LLC

Oxford, Daphne and Mobile

The legislation that created the Commission allowed four dispensaries to be licensed. Three of those, GP6 Wellness, RJK Holdings and CCS of Alabama, received licenses in December. Yellowhammer was granted a license, but a fifth dispensary, Capitol Medical, appealed the licensure to an administrative law judge. 
CCS of Alabama has planned locations in Montgomery and Talladega, according to its application submitted to the commission. The commission on Monday approved a relocation from Cullman to Bessemer for a third location.

RJK Holding has planned locations in Oxford, Daphne and Mobile, according to its website.
GP6 Wellness has planned locations in Birmingham, Athens and Attalla, according to its application submitted to the commission.
John McMillan, the director of AMCC, said in an interview Tuesday that the litigation has moved to the Montgomery County Circuit Court of Appeals, where Capitol Medical filed a temporary restraining order on Friday to prevent the three other dispensaries from proceeding with preparing their storefronts. Yellowhammer also filed an appeal in the same court to get their license.
“If the circuit court judge doesn’t take any other action besides what the commission has done, then that stay will probably be removed, and Yellowhammer will be allowed to go ahead and be issued a license and get to work,” McMillan said. 
Should Montgomery Circuit Court Judge James Anderson grant Yellowhammer’s appeal, McMillan said the Commission would likely approve its license at its Feb. 12 meeting. 
“So, bartering any other hiccup litigation wise, I think by mid- to late March is a chance we could have product on the shelves in the dispensary,” McMillan said.
McMillan previously predicted that the product would be on shelves by the end of 2025. 
The Alabama medical cannabis law, enacted in 2021, allows registered physicians to recommend cannabis for about 15 medical conditions, including cancer, depression, Parkinson’s Disease, PTSD, sickle-cell anemia, chronic pain, and terminal diseases. The approved product forms are restricted to tablets, tinctures, patches, oils, and gummies (only peach flavor), with raw plant material and smokable forms remaining prohibited.
People who suffer from the qualifying conditions must get approval from their physician and enter the patient registry in order to buy products at a dispensary. Litigation has also held up access to medical cannabis. 
Some firms sued the commission for not being awarded a license, citing a discriminatory process. Another case involved five parents that sued the commission over delays in access to cannabis. That lawsuit was dismissed in August.
Aday said that the commission has approved five physicians and is considering more applications.
“The next step for those physicians that the board has approved is to register with the commission and to get into the patient registry system so that when they begin seeing patients and making recommendations, they have the ability to enter those into the patient registry,” Aday said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/998e99a3-8678-4a5f-9b09-79bec2fa9c96-1024x665.jpg,,,2026-01-27 15:57:39.362902

Unlike Iowa Senate legislation that passed out of subcommittee Monday to prohibit tuition increases for first-year, resident students during their undergraduate education, House Study Bill 531 would freeze tuition and fees for all resident, undergraduate students from the time the bill is enacted until July 1, 2031.
Jillian Carlson, state relations officer for the Iowa Board of Regents, echoed comments she made on the subcommittee bill about the cap placed on tuition increases in April 2025, saying the board is “definitely keeping affordability in mind.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“The board is very, very conscious of when they set tuition rates, trying to keep it affordable for students,” Carlson said.
Both the board and the Professional Educators of Iowa are registered as undecided on the bill, with deputy director and lobbyist Nathan Arnold saying the organization likes the idea of not letting universities bait-and-switch tuition costs for students.
However, Arnold said the money universities need to keep operating has to come from somewhere, and if fewer dollars are coming in from students, the quality of offerings from universities may go down. It could also lead to “artificial price-setting,” he said.
Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, said during the subcommittee meeting rent prices are often just as much of a concern for college students and their families as tuition and fees, though he would like to see tuition become more predictable. He added that the state is passing more and more of a burden onto Iowa taxpayers by decreasing the support it gives to state universities.
When looking at institutions of higher education that receive tax dollars, Jacoby asked whether private universities that participate in the Iowa Tuition Grant program and community colleges — which could begin to offer bachelor’s degrees in the future — would be required to freeze their tuition as well.
Jacoby was joined by Rep. Heather Hora, R-Washington, and Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, who chaired the subcommittee. Collins said he would move the bill ahead for discussion in the full Iowa House Higher Education Committee in its next meeting, scheduled for Wednesday at 2:30 p.m.

The company has been beset by legal troubles and  a federal investigation. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller)Addiction Recovery Care, or ARC, Kentucky’s largest provider of alcohol and drug treatment, is facing mounting legal troubles.
A federal judge has ordered ARC and its owners, Tim and Lelia Robinson, to appear at a hearing Thursday in federal court in New York to show why they should not be held in contempt of court for spending assets the court had ordered ARC to freeze.
The Louisa-based company, which bills the federal Medicaid program for most of its services, also is the subject of an ongoing FBI investigation into possible health care fraud.
The judge’s order stems from a civil lawsuit filed earlier this month by Angelica Capital Trust against ARC, the Robinsons and affiliated companies,  claiming it advanced ARC $8 million which ARC failed to repay as promised.
U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels also ordered the Robinsons and ARC’s in-house lawyer, Jessica Burke, to appear for a deposition, or questioning under oath, by Angelica’s lawyers.
The court ordered ARC twice to preserve funds in a separate bank account that Angelica alleges it is owed but ARC has twice violated the court’s orders, Angelica said in a court filing.
Angelica, seeking to recover its money, said ARC is “on the brink of insolvency” in a court filing. It also said ARC is alleged to have committed  “massive fraud” in Medicaid and Medicare billing and is scrambling to raise nearly $28 million for a civil settlement with the federal government.
“ARC is wrongfully withholding this money because it is in desperate straits,” said Angelica’s lawsuit filed Jan. 12 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
ARC, in a response to the initial lawsuit, did not reference the fraud allegations or the proposed settlement with the U.S. Justice Department but asked the court not to freeze its assets, saying that would “disrupt the crucial health care services ARC provides to hundreds of patients.”
A spokeswoman for ARC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
ARC was founded in his native Eastern Kentucky by Tim Robinson, a lawyer and recovering alcoholic, to provide treatment for people with drug and alcohol addiction. The for-profit company grew rapidly in recent years, fueled by an expansion in Medicaid payments for such treatment and Robinson and his company emerged as prolific political donors.
But ARC has foundered in recent months amid fraud allegations and cuts in reimbursement from insurers who pay Medicaid claims, and has been forced to close facilities and lay off staff.
In court filings this week, Angelica alleged ARC has twice violated court orders not to transfer further assets and has placed only $3.6 million in a separate account rather than the $4.7 million ordered by the judge.
“Given (ARC’s) willingness to mislead the court and violate its orders . . . Angelica is gravely concerned that (ARC) will continue to dissipate Angelica’s property in violation of the court’s injunction,” said a Jan. 25 letter to the judge from Angelica’s lawyer.
Angelica, a trust firm based in the Bahamas, agreed to buy from ARC about $8 million worth of tax credits ARC expected to receive from the IRS, according to its lawsuit.
The purpose was for ARC “to get cash quickly” to make it look better to the potential buyer. In turn, ARC would repay Angelica when it received the funds from the IRS, according to the lawsuit.
ARC received $8 million from the IRS on Dec. 2, but ongoing efforts by Angelica to collect the money failed, and by mid-December, ARC told Angelica its deal to sell the company had fallen through and it was attempting to negotiate a sale with a new buyer, the lawsuit said.
Angelica said that despite repeated attempts, it has not been able to confirm ARC’s claim that a new, “supposed” buyer has agreed to advance enough money to restore funds in the court-ordered account to preserve money owed the trust company.
In addition to asking the judge to find ARC and its owners in contempt of court, it asked the judge to order ARC’s remaining funds to be placed in an account controlled by the court or into a third-party escrow account, with funds to be released only with the judge’s approval.
“At this point, (ARC) cannot be trusted to comply with the injunction and the only practical means of ensuring compliance appears to be to remove the funds from their control,” said the letter to the judge from Clifford Chance, a lawyer with the New York firm representing Angelica.
Meanwhile, the New York lawyers representing ARC have asked the court’s permission to withdraw from the case, citing a “fundamental disagreement” with their clients. Also, ARC “failed to cooperate in the representation and rendered the representation unreasonably difficult,” lawyers with Seyfarth Shaw said in a motion filed Jan. 26.
The case is scheduled for a hearing Thursday at 10 a.m. in federal court in New York.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/240627ARC_14MM-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 15:57:39.362902

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Middle Eastern politics returned to the Florida Legislature Tuesday, amid claims that Jewish and Palestinian people are being “erased” at the forefront of the charged debate.
The discussion centered around a bipartisan proposal to bar use of the term “West Bank” in Florida public schools and charter schools and replace that phrase with “Judea and Samaria,” the biblical names for the region that are widely used in Israel and the administrative name used by that government to describe the region.
The international community, including the U.S. government, refers to the territory as the West Bank and doesn’t recognize Israeli sovereignty there. Approximately 3 million Palestinians and half a million Jewish settlers live in the West Bank.
Last summer, U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said while visiting Israel that he would work to stop the use of the term “West Bank” at the federal level, instead promoting the exclusive use of the term “Judea and Samaria,” according to the Jerusalem Post.
The bill (HB 31) is co-sponsored by Rep. Chase Tramont, R-Port Orange, and Rep. Debra Tendrich, D-Lake Worth.
“Throughout history, people have tried to eradicate the Jewish people, either through eradication of the people themselves or our history,” Tendrich told the House State Affairs Committee. 
“Just like after Israel became a state, and Jordan coined the term West Bank, not for any other reason than to erase the Jewish connection from this land. Because the name Judea actually refers to the Jewish people. There’s no denying that. By changing the name to the West Bank, it’s actually turned the world’s focus away from being Jewish history, to make it sound like just another piece of territory.”
A similar proposal was introduced in the U.S. Congress in 2024, but has not come up for a vote yet. That bill would necessitate by law removal of past references to the term “West Bank” from all U.S. government documents.
The Florida measure received both support and opposition from members of the public on Tuesday.
Erasure
Adam Abutaa is Florida organizing manager with Emgage Action, a Muslim-American advocacy group. He said that by approving the bill, “Florida would be inserting itself into one of the most sensitive geopolitical conflicts in the world, something that is far outside the role of the state Legislature.”
“It elevates one narrative while erasing another, restricting how educators, researchers, public institutions can speak about a region recognized by the U.S. government and the international community,” he added.
Daniel Rach told the committee that the existing terminology “misses the thousands of years us Jews have in this region.”
“This bill recognizes the historically accurate names of the region and prevents the erasure of over 2,000 years of history,” he said. “And ensures that history is taught accurately and respectively and stands up against efforts to delegitimize Israel as a Jewish ancestral homeland.”
Among committee members, the bill received the most significant pushback from Democratic Representatives Angie Nixon of Jacksonville and Anna Eskamani of Orlando — both of whom were the only two members to support a resolution sponsored by Nixon in November 2023 calling for a ceasefire in the then early part of the two-year war between Israel and Hamas.
Nixon told Tramont the proposal “could be seen as an attack,  an erasure of the Palestinian people.” It wouldn’t do anything to help Floridians already suffering from the high price of groceries and property insurance bills, she added.
Eskamani said that, judging by the feedback she’s heard from her constituents and through the dialogue at the committee level, it was apparent that “people don’t want to be erased.”
“The Jewish community doesn’t want to be erased,” she said. “Our Palestinian brothers and sisters don’t want to be erased. And it’s so painful and so heavy but also at the same time the trauma is so connected and everyone feels the same. And I really wish there a path forward to figure out or have more time to how to craft something that reflects that?”
Tramont responded that he respects the concerns echoed by Nixon and Eskamani, but that he thought his bill does achieve that balance between the two sides.
“We’re not erasing Palestinian people,” he said. “No one is denying who they are as a people. What we are objecting to is the Jordanians intention of the terminology that was specifically used to literally erase Jewish history and ancestry to that land.”
The measure was mostly approved on a party-line basis, with Tendrich joining Republicans on the committee. It has now passed both of its assigned committees and is headed to the House floor. Its Senate companion (SB 1106) has passed its first assigned committee and has two more stops before reaching the floor of the upper chamber.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-4-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 14:57:37.810179

As predicted, revenue projections were down, driven largely by intentional tax changes last year, which will constrain the state’s ability to provide for Michigan residents at an already-unstable time.
With federal threats and attacks on health care, education, food assistance, housing and other basic needs set to upend the lives of families across the state, it’s crucial that state leaders do what they can to mitigate harm for Michiganders, not just now but in the future. 
State budget pressures rise as Michigan projects slower revenue growth through FY28

Merely protecting the basics is not enough, but we cannot do more with less, so any push by state lawmakers to implement steep tax cuts or simply shift funds around is ineffective and irresponsible at best. Leaders need to determine what is necessary to ensure Michiganders are thriving. They need to determine how they can improve the state’s revenue structure to best serve the needs of the people. 
We recognize this won’t be easy, especially when policymakers in Washington have put a major strain on the state’s budget by prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans over health care and the cost of groceries. But Michigan’s leaders need to work together to meet this moment. 
As the governor and state lawmakers begin crafting their respective budgets, they need to keep Michigan’s people central to their decisions. Strong Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) policies are necessary to make sure families don’t fall through the cracks. It’s also vital that we improve child care affordability and accessibility, reduce the rising cost of safe and affordable housing, and continue to invest in programs that create family economic security, like Rx Kids.
Michigan mamas make the case for statewide expansion of cash-based assistance for babies

And right now, we absolutely cannot lose sight of the importance of stronger, more sustained investments in the state’s K-12 system. Michigan continues to rank abysmally low in education nationally. Our current ranking from the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s KIDS COUNT® data is 44th, putting us squarely in the bottom 10 states in the country for education once again. Making sure students have what they need to be successful in their classrooms is crucial to stopping this trend. 
While some forward movement has been made in educational funding by the state more recently, it doesn’t change the fact that Michigan spent decades underinvesting in public schools. Recovery is in the very early stages, especially when you consider inflation. 
School districts are also struggling with more restrictions on how they can use state funding and are providing many additional, important services outside of the classroom these days that need to continue to be financially supported. Federal threats to the state’s public education system will also undermine the progress that has been made in these past few years.
Given these challenges, the state must continue to target investments toward those who need it most: students who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, students in need of special education services and English-language learners. Almost half of Michigan students — nearly  684,500 — are economically disadvantaged, and the share of students growing up in homes with low incomes is even higher in some Michigan counties. And the number of special education students from birth to age 26 is on the rise, growing from more than 208,500 in 2018 to over 223,000 in 2024 in Michigan. And statewide, more than 171,300 children ages 5 to 17 live in a home where a language other than English is spoken. 
Stronger, targeted investments in these students are necessary to ensure they thrive in their classrooms. Maintaining investments in student and mental health services and investing in effective literacy support are also necessary if schools are to do the job of supporting students.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Preacher Nicholas Heald lifted a well-worn Bible and his booming voice Tuesday in the Capitol rotunda to declare abortion the equivalent of murder and to amplify a denunciation of the Kansas Legislature for refusing to pass a bill outlawing abortion services statewide.
Heald was surrounded on the third floor by like-minded activists — several wielding large posters with graphic images of a deceased fetus — who made certain House and Senate members, Republicans and Democrats alike, could witness their impatience with politicians reluctant to take a big leap toward ending abortion in Kansas.
He dismissed skeptics who argued such a bill wouldn’t pass the GOP-controlled Legislature or would be vetoed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly or had no chance of surviving constitutional challenges before the Kansas Supreme Court.
“The legislators, our representatives, for far too long … have failed in your duty to establish equal justice protection for born and pre-born people,” Heald said. “We have come to you year after year after year … to protect every one of your pre-born neighbors, with no exceptions. And, you have failed. You have refused to do so for political reasons.”
“How much more blood will be on your hands as you sign more so-called pro-life bills that regulate murder?” he added.
His message was aimed, in part, at participants in the Kansas version of March for Life, who plan a rally noon Wednesday on south steps of the Capitol to press for new legal obstacles to reproductive rights. Those rights have been declared fundamental by the Kansas Supreme Court in decisions shielding the right of women to end a pregnancy.

Satanic voices
On the first floor of the Capitol and on the south steps of the building, supporters of an organization known as Satanic Grotto took part in a much smaller but equally robust protest in support of reproductive choice.
More significantly, however, Satanic Grotto president Michael Stewart said the group was there to continue building the foundation of a potential First Amendment lawsuit challenging the state’s action to allow Abortion is Murder supporters to bring into the Statehouse posters with ghastly and bloody images but to forbid Satanic Grotto from doing likewise.
“We’re here to say that in Kansas there are horrific people who hang gory signs and harass women and are part of a movement that has a history of incredible violence here in Kansas,” said Stewart, who was taken into police custody in March 2025 at the Capitol while trying to tear a Bible in half and stomp on communion wafers. “We are game to play by the rules as long as everybody’s paying by the rules.”
Stewart referenced the 2009 murder of Wichita physician George Tiller, who at that time was among few U.S. doctors performing late-term abortions. He was shot to death in church by anti-abortion activist Scott Roeder, who confessed to the murder and defended the violence because “pre-born children’s lives were in imminent danger.”
Stewart said Satanic Grotto was a group of “independent satanists” who came together for a sense of community. In the process, they’ve taken on “kind of a sacred duty” to take part in the public debate about political speech at the Capitol. He said group members wanted the state government to know that “we’re serious about what we’re doing, that we’re documenting it and we’re giving them a chance to respond and fix these issues before it can upgrade to litigation.”
One result of Satanic Grotto’s activism would be to demonstrate that state officials at the Capitol engaged in selective enforcement of rules related to protest signs. Information being gathered, he said, would support a complaint filed with the Kansas Department of Administration alleging the Christian anti-abortion group received preferential treatment and expression by people taking part in counterprotests against Abortion is Murder were treated unfairly.
Before the political clash of ideas Tuesday, Stewart said his colleagues had intended to haul a 9-foot-tall sculpture named “Zombie Jesus” onto the Statehouse grounds and into the Capitol. Due to bitter weather conditions, he said, they sidelined the massive piece of art.

Abortion as murder
In the Capitol, signs displayed by Abortion is Murder adherents included “If abortion is murder, the victim is the baby,” “Taking a pill to terminate a baby is murder with malice aforethought,” “What has 50+ years of incrementalism accomplished?” “Abortion is murder — It must and shall be abolished” and “Abolish Abortion: Thou shalt not murder.”
Other materials distributed during the Abortion is Murder event said: “Abolish child sacrifice — ban in vitro fertilization” and “Public Service Announcement: Women are not sex objects. Babies are not body parts.” One folding piece of literature illustrated blood-covered hands with a photograph of the remains of a fetus aborted at 10 weeks. The image was surrounded by citations of Bible scripture from Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Isaiah and Psalm. A similarly graphic handout contained the same photo with the text: “You know this is murder. Stop suppressing the truth. Demand the total and immediate abolition of abortion.”
Curtis Knapp, pastor at New Hope Baptist Church in Seneca, spoke during the first of two sermons by Abortion is Murder supporters in the rotunda.
“With respect to sin, you either make war with it or you make peace with it,” he said. “With respect to the murder of the unborn, we have chosen peace, peaceful coexistence. Consequently, our conscience has been ruined.”
Knapp urged Republican legislators to quit rationalizing why abolishing abortion would be impractical or unwise. He said lawmakers claimed they couldn’t vote for an abolition bill because they might not get reelected and, if that occurred, the Republican Party could forfeit its supermajority in the House and Senate.
“Keep in mind, Kansas is a state where Republicans have enjoyed a supermajority uninterrupted in the Senate since 1992 and the House since 2012,” Knapp said. “Registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats in Kansas by almost 2-to-1.

In an interview Tuesday morning, Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, said the memo about planning for new budget cuts was sent to state agency directors because of uncertainty over how the Idaho Legislature’s new federal tax conformity bill, House Bill 519, will impact the amount of revenue available to spend in the state budget.
“The big issue right now is tax conformity,” Grow told the Idaho Capital Sun. “And I don’t know where we are, but you saw a bill that came up Friday from the House that essentially conformed (with federal tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act).”

In the new budget memo, Keith Bybee, budget and policy analysis division manager for the Idaho Legislative Services Office, gave agency directors until noon on Friday to submit budget reduction plans. 
Under the memo, state agency directors must submit two plans – one for cutting an additional 1% and another plan for cutting an additional 2% from their budgets in both this year’s fiscal year 2026 and next year’s fiscal year 2027. 
Those new cuts would be in addition to the 3% budget cuts that Gov. Brad Little announced last summer in response to state revenue shortfalls, which could bring the total impact of the cuts up to 5% for both this year and next. 
“While JFAC is working through the current budget cycle for FY 2026 and FY 2027, it is evaluating options to balance the state budget,” Bybee wrote in Monday’s memo. “One of those options is to further reduce budgets in FY 2026 and FY 2027.”
 Senate Minority Caucus chairwoman says she doesn’t support additional cuts, calls on Legislature to dip into rainy day funds

Idaho Education News first reported on the additional new budget reductions Monday. 
Bybee sent the memo on behalf of the co-chairs of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short.

JFAC is a powerful committee of the Idaho Legislature that sets all of the state budgets for every state agency and department. Grow and Rep. Josh Tanner, also R-Eagle, are the two co-chairs of JFAC.
Senate Minority Caucus Chair Janie Ward-Engelking, a Boise Democrat who serves on JFAC, said she strongly opposes new budget cuts, which she said will hurt the state coming this late in the fiscal year. 
Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30 each year. That means that the current fiscal year 2026 is a little more than halfway over.
“We are already cutting into the bone on some of these agencies,” Ward-Engelking said in an interview at the Idaho State Capitol. “Half of the year is already done, so half of their budget or more has been expended, depending on if it is personnel, and we could be talking about massive furloughs. I am not in favor of this.” 
Instead of cutting state agency budgets deeper, Ward-Engelking said the state should dip into its rainy day reserve funds or make implementation of the federal tax changes effective as of January 2026, not retroactive as currently proposed.

“We have rainy day funds,” Ward-Engelking said. “That’s taxpayer money that is sitting there. We seeded the clouds. We made it rain. But we can fix this.”
After the Legislature cut state revenue by approving $450 million in tax cuts and tax credits in 2025, Ward-Engelking blamed the Idaho Legislature for the budget issues dominating the 2026 session. Ward-Engelking said legislators cut taxes too deeply, which already reduced state revenue too much. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Idaho’s tax conformity bill has big implications for the state budget

Bybee circulated the memo about planning for additional budget cuts shortly after the Idaho Legislature introduced a new bill. House Bill 519, that is designed to fully adopt the federal tax changes President Donald Trump championed in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Rep. Jeff Ehlers, the Meridian Republican who sponsored House Bill 519, estimated it would cost $155 million per year to comply with the federal tax changes. The $155 million estimate is identical to the estimate Little provided for tax conformity earlier this month when he delivered the State of the State address. 
But there is a key difference between Little’s proposal to comply with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the plan in House Bill 519. Little structured his budget proposal so that Idaho would comply with the tax changes effective Jan. 1, 2026. But Ehlers’ bill calls for adopting the tax changes retroactively – with personal changes going back to 2025 and business changes going back to 2022. 
Idaho state lawmaker proposes full adoption of ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ tax changes 

That retroactive compliance could have an additional budget impact compared Little’s plan to begin compliance in 2026. 
“If the Legislature is going to go ahead and put (conformity) back in 2025, that’s at least $155 million, and that wipes out that increased revenue that we tried to have,” Grow said Tuesday. 
The state budget is built around revenue collections, and the largest sources of state revenue are tax collections. Cutting taxes reduces the amount of money that individuals or businesses pay and reduces the amount of revenue collected by the state to pay for programs and services in the state budget such as funding for roads and bridges, funding to fight wildfires on state land, funding for the state’s K-12 public school system and funding for the pay and benefits of more than 20,000 state employees. 
The state budget has faced a revenue shortfall for fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2027 following five years of income tax cuts approved by the Idaho Legislature that reduced state revenue by a combined total of $4 billion, according to the nonprofit Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy. 
Revenue collections rebounded in December thanks to strong corporate income tax collections that reversed the projected budget deficit for fiscal year 2026. 
Grow said Friday’s deadline for agency directors to identify new cuts of 1% and 2% represents a quick timeline. But Grow said tax conformity has a big impact on the state budget, and he wants to understand the revenue impact before JFAC moves forward setting maintenance budgets for state agencies or begins cutting budgets through recissions. 
Grow said approving new, additional budget cuts could allow the Idaho Legislature breathing room in the budget to conform to the federal tax cuts and still pass a balanced budget that leaves a positive ending cash balance. 
“(Fiscal year) 26 has got to be strengthened as far as the bottom line,” Grow said. 
The federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes about 39 tax changes, Idaho House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said. Some of those tax changes for individuals include no tax on workers’ overtime pay, no tax on workers’ tips, an expanded deduction for senior citizens and not interest on borrower’s car loan interest.

The state Department of Commerce announced in October that North Dakota Country Fest had been awarded the $4 million grant. It was one of 23 tourism projects sharing in $15 million in grants. 
Luke Shafer, the founder and owner of North Dakota Country Fest near New Salem, said in an email to the state agency that it had decided not to relocate the stage, move the festival grounds and build out the campground and “change the experience that our guests have come to know and love.” 
The state agency will begin taking grant applications Feb. 10. The application period closes March 10. Applications must be submitted online.
Eligible applicants include for-profit businesses, nonprofit organizations and tourism-related entities. Previous applicants that did not receive a grant can reapply. 
Grants are awarded for “the development or expansion of attractions that strengthen North Dakota’s economy, and enhance quality of life for residents,” the Commerce Department said. 
State and federal government entities and previous grant recipients from the 2023-25 or 2025-27 rounds are not eligible.

Mike Dunleavy gestures during his State of the State address on Jan. 22, 2026. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy has proposed a 4% statewide summer sales tax, effective through 2034, as part of his plan to bring Alaska’s state revenue and expenses in line for the long term.
If adopted, the sales tax would be Alaska’s first statewide, general-purpose levy since state legislators abolished Alaska’s income tax in 1980.
Alongside the tax bill, the governor has proposed a tighter state spending cap and a constitutional amendment that would guarantee a Permanent Fund dividend lower than scheduled by current law but above what legislators have approved in recent years.
“This comprehensive plan is designed to bridge the next seven years by stabilizing state finances, limiting spending growth, restoring a rules-based PFD, and sharing responsibility through targeted, time-limited revenue measures that support investment and predictability,” the governor wrote in a letter to state lawmakers.
Since 2015, persistently low oil prices and plateaued oil production from the North Slope have dogged state lawmakers who have struggled to balance Alaska’s need for services with the desire to pay large Permanent Fund dividends.
While most of Alaska’s general-purpose state revenue comes from the Alaska Permanent Fund, oil remains the No. 2 source of flexible spending money for the state, leaving the annual budget process subject to the vagaries of global markets.
The governor’s plan resembles one drafted by a bipartisan, bicameral legislative working group in 2021 and 2022. That plan and others like it have never significantly advanced in the Legislature.
Senate Bill 227, containing the bulk of the governor’s plan, was introduced on Monday and referred to the Senate Finance Committee for further discussion. An identical version will be introduced in the House on Wednesday.
The most fiscally consequential item in the bill is the sales tax, which would peak during the summer tourist season and drop to 2% between October and March.
That tax is expected to raise as much as $815 million per year for state services and the Permanent Fund dividend by Fiscal Year 2032. 
Dunleavy’s proposed budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 — fiscal year 2027 — is about $7.75 billion and has a deficit of almost $1.5 billion.
The Dunleavy administration expects that revenue from oil production and a proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline will compensate for the phaseout of all the taxes in the long term.
Under SB 227, the state’s corporate income tax would fall to zero in 2031; the sales tax wouldn’t expire until 2034, leaving individual Alaskans paying higher tax rates than corporations for a period.
“Normally, sales tax is left to local governments. So I know it was a hot issue in Anchorage when the Mayor proposed that, so I think it is going to hit a lot of households,” said Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, applauded Dunleavy on Monday for putting forward a fiscal proposal, even if he disagrees with some of the components.
“The governor’s putting out a bill. I commend him for that. He’s putting out, you know, he’s throwing out ideas. I give him credit for that,” he said.
Wielechowski and other legislators said they want to fully analyze what the governor is proposing before opining on it. 
“There are a lot of parts to this bill, and the No. 1 thing for me — without a complete analysis — is it’s really unclear on how this is going to affect hard-working Alaskans,” said House Minority Leader DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer. “It is my No. 1 priority to make sure everyday Alaskans aren’t on the losing end of this.”
The Alaska Municipal League, which represents local governments across Alaska, is particularly interested in the governor’s proposal.
The League has previously said it would prefer a statewide income tax to a sales tax.
In almost every part of Alaska, except for Anchorage, sales taxes are a pillar of services. 
Many cities and boroughs exempt certain things, like food and utilities. Under the Dunleavy proposal, the state would be in charge of collecting sales taxes and would remit money to cities and boroughs.
Local exemptions and sales tax caps could vanish in the process, with the state instead determining what is taxed and not. 
“This is a 56-page bill that we are still going through. Sales tax is a major component of that, but sales tax shouldn’t be thought about independently from the other components,” said Nils Andreassen, director of the league.
In addition to the sales tax, SB 227 temporarily raises the state’s minimum oil tax, adds a surcharge of 15 cents per barrel of oil produced on the North Slope and adds part of the corporate sales tax update that Dunleavy vetoed last year.
Andreassen noted that regardless of its source, tax revenue flows into the state’s general fund for any number of uses.
“All taxes are connected at some level,” he said. 
The governor’s plan for the Permanent Fund dividend, enclosed in a constitutional amendment proposal separate to SB 227, is similar to one he proposed in 2021. 
Currently, the state’s No. 1 source of general-purpose revenue is an annual transfer from the Permanent Fund to the state treasury. In FY27, that transfer will be worth $4 billion.
The “50-50 dividend” proposed by the governor would reserve half of that transfer for dividends, or about $2 billion, if it were in place this year.
That amounts to roughly $3,200 per PFD recipient, based on the number of recipients in 2025.
Under a current, disused formula in place since the 1980s, the dividend would be about $3,800 per recipient.
That formula hasn’t been used since 2015, and lawmakers have instead set the amount by fiat, typically using a figure that can be paid with available revenue after services are covered. 
Legislators can ignore formulas in state law because the state’s annual budget bill is a law, and when one law conflicts with another, the newer law takes precedence.
Putting a dividend formula in the constitution would bind future governors and legislatures, and put the dividend atop the annual budgetary priority list, alongside education and other constitutionally mandated functions.
Adopting a constitutional amendment requires two-thirds of the House, two-thirds of the Senate, and approval by voters in the next general election. 
Alaskans have not adopted an amendment since 2004, and the Legislature hasn’t put one before voters since 2016.

(Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A Florida House committee sent to the House floor a bill that would define how school library materials may be “harmful to minors,” building on a controversial 2023 law that led to removal of library books from schools based on objections from the public. 
The House Education & Employment Committee approved HB 1119, its second and final committee, despite concerns from the public, some lawmakers, and advocacy groups that the bill may be used to eliminate books that discuss experiences of people in the LGBTQ community or stories depicting harsh realities. Others worried it could keep some students from being interested in reading.
The bill and its identical Senate companion would add to state law a definition of what is to be considered “harmful to minors.”
The definition the lawmakers propose: “any reproduction, imitation, characterization, description, exhibition, presentation, or representation, of whatever kind or form, depicting nudity, sexual conduct, or sexual excitement when it: predominantly appeals to prurient, shameful, or morbid interest; and is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material or conduct for minors.”
Supporters of the bill emphasized the need to keep “pornography” away from students in schools, especially considering the materials are paid for with tax dollars.
The bill ran aground last year amid concern it would prohibit schools from keeping material with literary, artistic, political, or scientific value if it also contains material “harmful to minors,” bucking the Miller Test — a Supreme Court test that protects otherwise obscene speech if it contains literary or artistic value. 
The bill is sponsored by Rep. Doug Bankson, a Republican from Apopka. The identical Senate bill, SB 1692, is sponsored by Sen. Stan McClain, a Republican from Ocala. McClain sponsored the bill last session, but it died after First Amendment concerns emerged during its first committee hearing. This session, the Senate version has three committee assignments but has yet to be heard. 
The proposal builds on a 2023 law that allows the public to challenge library materials they deem pornographic. That law has led to Florida making nationwide headlines for the number of books removed because of it. In 2024, lawmakers addressed overuse of the law, limiting non-parent members of the public from objecting to more than one library material per month. 
“Contrary to inaccurate claims and misinformation that may be circulating, nothing in this legislation addresses banning classical literature or sexual orientation, gender identity, political views, religious issues, vulgarity, or bad language, violence, or gore. This bill solely addresses materials in public schools or school libraries for children that contain obscenity or, in more common terms, blatant pornographic and sexually explicit content,” Bankson said.
The list of public commenters, largely in opposition to the measure, was long enough that each of their speaking time was limited by the committee chair to 30 seconds.
Lawmakers questioned whether this bill and the existing law amount to a ban on books. Republicans emphasized that books unavailable in school libraries are likely to still be in public libraries or available for purchase at book stores. Countering, public commenters feared that it serves as essentially a ban for students without the resources to buy the book themself. 
“This is not about book banning, it is an issue about what is age appropriate,” Rep. Kim Kendall, a Republican from St. Augustine, said.
Rep. Wallace Aristide, a Democrat from Miami, asked whether the bill would limit private school libraries. It would not. 
“I don’t know still today what guides you’re going to use other than sexual arousal that will decide whether the book is going to be removed,” Rep. Yvonne Hinson, a Democrat from Gainesville said. “This is not constitutionally, we can’t even ask our teachers, libraries, or parents to use that as a guide to removing a book, especially if I got to remove it, I won’t be the one trying to figure out if it’s making me sexually aroused.”
Bankson’s re-election campaign website leaned on his experience having founded Victory Church World Outreach Center, a nondenominational Christian church in Apopka where he and his wife preach.

The 2023 law was deemed “overbroad and unconstitutional” last summer by a federal judge.
That law allowed for books to stay on shelves that were considered to have literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Bankson and McClain’s proposal would prevent school boards from keeping books based on those values if they contain “harmful” content.
Last year, Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, called the bill “censorship” that breeds “indoctrination into ignorance” and that book removals would rise in number.
The measure would provide a carve out for required health education course material. It would allow the state to withhold funding from districts that do not comply.
The bill passed 12-5, the five votes against were Democrats.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Cassandra Sanchez, who has served as New Hampshire’s child advocate since 2022, is being replaced, Gov. Kelly Ayotte announced Tuesday.
As child advocate, Sanchez is the state’s official youth-focused watchdog, overseeing the state’s child welfare, juvenile justice, and youth care systems, and advocating for the best interests of children in the state.
Sanchez told the Bulletin Tuesday she received a call from the governor’s chief of staff late Monday informing her the state was moving on from her as child advocate. Her term expired this month. The governor’s office didn’t answer the Bulletin’s questions about why Ayotte decided not to extend her tenure for another term. Sanchez said she’ll remain in the role on holdover status until her replacement is confirmed.
“I’m so proud of the work that the office has done in the time that I’ve worked in the office,” Sanchez said. “I would not have done anything different. Nothing in this role was ever or should ever have been about me. And so at the end of the day, if I’m not the one that they want in the position, I hope that the office can continue the good work that we were doing.”
On Tuesday, Ayotte nominated Diana Fenton, a former prosecutor and currently the chair of the governance unit within the Department of Education, to replace Sanchez. As chair of the governance unit, Fenton served as legal counsel for the department. She also served as assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice from 2007 to 2015. She will need to be confirmed by the Executive Council before she can be officially appointed.
“Throughout her career in public service, Diana Fenton has held herself to the highest professional standards,” Ayotte said in a statement. “Having worked at the Department of Education and as an Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice, Diana knows that protecting children is critical to the future of our state.”
However, Sanchez said she’s concerned that her potential successor doesn’t have any experience in child welfare.
“Child welfare is so unique and such a nuanced field,” she said. “Without my expertise in child welfare, I would not have been able to have as many successes as we’ve had with the office.”
Sanchez, who worked at the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families before coming to New Hampshire, said Fenton can expect “a huge learning curve.” She advised Fenton to lean on the employees in the office because “they have, collectively, so many years of experience in this work, and they are true experts.” Sanchez said even with her experience she had a greater learning curve than she expected.
Fenton didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s requests for comment.
Fenton is set to take over the office less than a year after major budget cuts shrunk its team. The state budget signed into law this June cut $500,000 from the Office of the Child Advocate as a cost-saving measure. As a result, the office went from a staff of nine to four, Sanchez told the Bulletin at the time.
Sanchez said she doesn’t know for certain why she isn’t being reappointed, but she is “pretty confident” that her public opposition to a number of Republican LGBTQ+ bills “was likely a big cause.” In April 2024, she joined a coalition of LGBTQ+ advocates in opposition to bills that would ban gender-affirming care, ban transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports teams, keep transgender children out of restrooms that don’t align with their sex at birth, and require public school teachers to reveal a students’ sexuality to their parents if asked. In April, multiple Republican state lawmakers publicly rebuked those efforts and said it was in part why they wanted to reduce, or even eliminate, the Office of the Child Advocate’s budget. Ultimately, lawmakers passed legislation prohibiting the child advocate from participating in partisan advocacy.
Sanchez said she doesn’t regret taking those positions.
“By no means would I ever change our stance on those issues,” Sanchez said, “and the way in which we advocated to support all children in the state.”
Sanchez was the second person to serve as child advocate, preceded by Moira O’Neill, who resigned after one term. The office, which is independent of any other state agency, was created by the Legislature in 2018 in response to a massive abuse scandal at the Sununu Youth Services Center. More than 1,300 former residents of the Sununu Center have filed lawsuits, with allegations including abuse, assault, and rape. The state has already paid hundreds of millions of dollars in court settlements to victims.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cassandrasanchez-1024x621.jpg,,,2026-01-27 14:57:37.810179

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said an “internal investigation” is underway into Miana Moran’s death in early 2025.
“She was a child made in the image of God because she deserved protection,” said Sen. Jay Taylor, R-Taylor, Tuesday on the Senate floor. “We cannot accept the system where the agency investigates itself behind closed doors and elect lawmakers who are unable to confirm that children are truly being protected.”
Sen. Jay Taylor, R-Taylor, holds up a photo of Miana Moran, an 11-year-old who died severely malnourished in Taylor County in 2025. (Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)
WCHS first reported last week that CPS made numerous visits to the home of Miana Moran, but took no action prior to the child’s death in early 2025. Those details were shared by the prosecuting attorney now leading a murder case tied to her death. 
“If those reports are accurate, West Virginians are right to ask obvious and fair questions, ‘How did this happen?” Taylor said.
“We have failed in our responsibilities for our children. That is hard to say, but it’s necessary to say,” he continued.
Miana Moran weighed 43 pounds when she died early last year. A medical examiner said the girl had head lice, a yellowish tint to her skin, bones “visibly protruding” because of her extreme thinness, and multiple bruises and lacerations on her body. Miana Moran had been enrolled in the Upshur County Schools virtual program in 2021.
Shannon Robinson, a custodian of the girl, and the child’s biological father, Aaron James Moran, were arrested and charged with murder of the girl.
Senate members held a moment of silence for Miana Moran. 
Taylor said legislation is being drafted in response to the girl’s death to create “meaningful reform.”’ He called for increased legislative visibility over CPS without compromising the privacy of children’s cases.
“We do not continue to accept a system where the public not only learns what went wrong when a child is dead,” Taylor said.  “The time is now to reform Child Protective Services in the state — not with rhetoric, not with excuses, but with accountability, transparency and responsibility worthy of the trust West Virginians place in us.”
In 2024, 14-year-old Kyneddi Miller was found dead in a skeletal state in her Boone County home. Reporters uncovered that CPS and the West Virginia State Police were aware of Miller prior to her death; state foster care officials said they had no record of a referral that could have prompted an investigation. After a controversial investigation into the situation, the Department of Human Services said it would tighten up its abuse and neglect referral process and said it would change how it screens those referrals. 
A recent federal audit of the West Virginia’s foster care system showed the state didn’t comply with investigation requirements when responding to the majority of reports of child abuse and neglect during the time period reviewed (Oct. 1, 2023 through Sept. 30, 2024).
State lawmakers have introduced bills this session attempting to bolster accountability for DoHS, which oversees West Virginia’s overwhelmed foster care system. One measure, House Bill 4579, would require CPS workers to wear a body camera while investigating reports of child abuse and neglect. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Judiciary, where it hasn’t yet been taken up for consideration.
Morrisey has announced his own proposed foster care reforms since taking office, including increasing transparency of the struggling system.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills is asking the Legislature to set aside $2.25 million for Maine-based reproductive health care providers that lost federal Medicaid funding.
After the federal budget reconciliation bill was signed by President Donald Trump last July, Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England lost millions in federal dollars due to a provision blocking  providers from Medicaid reimbursements for non-abortion services, such as cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections and primary care.
That provision only applies to nonprofit health care organizations that offer abortions, although no federal money has been used to fund abortions for decades due to the Hyde Amendment.
“President Trump and Republicans have made clear that they do not care about the health of Maine people,” Mills said in a statement Tuesday ahead of the State of the State address, during which she will announce the funding request. “While I have fought to expand health care to people, they are ripping it away — and they have cruelly targeted reproductive health care providers in Maine by slashing funding for vital services that have nothing to do with abortion.” 
The proposal, which will be part of the governor’s supplemental budget plan, is in addition to $6 million approved by the Legislature last session for reproductive health care services. 
In addition to Medicaid reimbursements, Maine providers were also threatened with the loss of family planning funds provided through Title X, though those funds were restored last year after being paused for four months. 
Still, the cuts have had a severe impact on Maine providers.
Maine Family Planning, the state’s largest reproductive health care provider, had to shut down its primary care practice last October, and Planned Parenthood is still in the middle of a legal fight to reinstate Medicaid reimbursements..
It is not clear whether the governor’s proposal will cover the entirety of the lost federal reimbursements. 
Kat Mavengere, spokesperson for Maine Family Planning, said in a statement, “With Trump in office for another three years, we are going to need ongoing support to replace lost federal Medicaid funds.” 
Mavengere also noted that because the $2.25 million would be a one-time payment, it’s not enough for the organization to restart its primary care practices at clinics in Presque Isle, Houlton and Ellsworth.
Throughout it all, both providers never stopped accepting Medicaid patients, despite not receiving reimbursements. 
“We are super committed to ensuring that patients get the care they receive, regardless of ability to pay. That is central to our mission,” said Lisa Marguiles, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood’s Maine division.
“But it was starting to take a toll. And resources are limited, and so the ability to know that funds are coming to support patient access to care is everything,” Marguiles added, pointing to Mills’ announcement Tuesday.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/maine-family-planning-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 14:57:37.810179

(Photo via Florida Division of Emergency Management X account)The Florida agency in charge of the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention facility must release all texts, emails, and other communications with federal authorities about how the migrant center was set up and run, a Leon County judge ruled Tuesday.
The Florida Division of Emergency Management has just over two weeks to disclose these records to the non-profit Friends of the Everglades, Circuit Judge Angela Dempsey in Leon County said. The decision comes amid a six-month legal battle between the state and the environmental group over whether the Everglades center is in compliance with environmental laws.
“The Division shall by no later than February 12, 2026, fully and completely comply with Plaintiff Friends of the Everglades public records requests … with all responsive public records through the date of this order,” the ruling reads. 
It enumerates the group’s requests on June 24, Sep. 11, and Sep. 13 for communication records between state and federal officials on plans to use the training center, how it was operated, and any information on grant requests.
The center has come under scrutiny since Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced its construction on June 19. It can hold up to 3,000 migrants at a time and has seen roughly 20,000 detainees since its opening six months ago.
Aside from environmental concerns, Democrats and humanitarian groups worried that the facility could be harming detainees and may be illegally preventing lawmakers from making unannounced visits. Both of those concerns were nixed by Florida courts. A human rights organization alleged in December that Alligator Alcatraz was torturing detainees, although the state denied wrongdoing.
What happened?
Friends of the Everglades sued in federal court just days after Florida announced construction at the site. They argued that transforming the near-defunct Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport into a migrant detention center would violate a federal environmental law by disrupting the ecosystem and harming the diverse Everglades wildlife.
But, the state argued, they hadn’t applied for federal funding for the detention center. They maintained this throughout the case, until a three-judge appeals panel in September ruled that a state-run center can’t violate a federal enviornmental act because there are no federal ties.
But days later, FDEM Director Kevin Guthrie confirmed that Florida had applied for a federal reimbursement grant. And, in another twist, sparse records returned to Friends of the Everglades revealed that the state had applied for the federal grant in early August, despite making no mention of the grant request in the slew of court documents that would follow. 
In October, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced that Florida would be awarded $608.4 million in a federal grant award. As of December, that money had yet to come in.
Throughout this time, Friends of the Everglades said they’d made public records requests in June, September, and October related to any communications between state and federal officials. But it wouldn’t be until Oct. 10 that FDEM returned any public records, the group says, and it was a one-page document showing that a grant request was made by the state on Aug. 7. 
Friends of the Everglades believe more records exist.
Since then, Friends has asked the trial court to find that the state violated public records law and to force officials to produce all records within 48 hours of an order. Instead, Judge Dempsey ruled Tuesday that FDEM has until Feb. 12.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alligator-Alcatraz-via-FL-Division-of-Emergency-Management-X-account.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 13:57:30.963543

He added that he did not believe that any Democratic candidate in the race had been involved in the ad campaign. Calling it a “brazen” attempt to interfere in the primary race, Hertel said that it was important to bring attention to the issue now, in case similar tactics were used to target other races in the regular 2026 election cycle.
State Rep. Amos O’Neal (D-Saginaw), whose district covers much of the 35th Senate District, also said, “It’s dishonest, it’s deceptive and it’s downright dirty.”
The seat, which was left vacant when U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) took her office as a federal representative, is crucial for control of the state Senate, where Democrats currently hold a 19-18 majority that would disappear if the Republican candidate wins the May general election for the seat. 
In that case, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist would be able to cast a tie-breaking vote — but only if every member of the chamber is present and there is a 19-19 tie.
Hertel emphasized that the state party remains neutral in primary elections. He also said that he would not speculate on the motivations behind the ad campaign, but that “this doesn’t happen without Senate Republican leadership knowing. ”
Pugh is seen as a more progressive candidate in the Democratic race, which has six candidates vying for the party’s seat. Some Democrats — including McDonald Rivet and O’Neal — have instead endorsed Saginaw fire chief Chedrick Greene instead, who is seen by some as a preferable candidate in a general election.
Pugh’s spokesperson, Greg Bowens, did not directly address the ad controversy when asked by the Detroit News, instead saying he didn’t want to respond to “rumor or innuendo.” However, he did note “negative, racist” flyers in which Pugh’s face was darkened to look more “menacing.” Those flyers, according to the Midland Daily News, were mailed to district voters in late December from Lansing-based nonprofit Michigan Vindicated.
Chair of the Midland County Democratic Party Jennifer Austin called the ProgressiveMI campaign insulting to the intelligence of Democratic voters in the Tri-Cities area that includes Saginaw, Bay City and Midland. 
“Please, research your candidates, do not accept these dirty tactics, and if you get a chance, let Trump and his allies know that these sorts of tactics will not be accepted by the honest people of the Tri-Cities,” Austin urged voters in the Democratic primary.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-132731-1024x577.png,,,2026-01-27 13:57:30.963543

He said he'd eventually like lunches to be universal too. (File photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)I am 76 years old, and I still remember the feeling of going to school hungry.
Hunger is not just an empty stomach. It is a constant distraction, a quiet anxiety, and a barrier to learning that follows a child into the classroom.
I support Gov. Henry McMaster’s proposal that all children eat breakfast at school for free. That should include lunch too.
When people debate whether schools should provide meals, I often wonder how many of them have lived that reality.
As a child and teenager, I experienced chronic hunger.
My mother raised eight children while working as a domestic worker, earning $25 a day plus bus fare. After rent and bills were paid, there was very little left for food. She was resourceful beyond measure — taking flour, water, and sugar to make bread, adding jelly when she could — and sending us off to school.
We walked nearly 10 miles a day because there were no buses. Government-issued cheese helped, but it was never enough.
Those memories are not distant. They are vivid, and they are painful. Hunger made it difficult to concentrate, to retain information, and to feel confident in the classroom.
When a child is hungry, learning becomes secondary to survival.
Unfortunately, this is not just a story from the past. Many families across South Carolina today face similar choices: rent or groceries, utilities or meals.
According to Feeding America, one of every six children in South Carolina live in food-insecure households.
These children arrive at school carrying burdens no child should have to bear.
Expecting children to be attentive, engaged, and successful while they are hungry is unrealistic. Nutrition is foundational to learning, health, and emotional regulation.
Research consistently shows that access to nutritious food improves attendance, behavior, and academic outcomes.
This is why policies that expand access to school meals matter. They are not about charity or convenience. They are about access to education and opportunities to succeed. When we ensure children are fed, we give them a fair chance to learn, grow, and thrive.
My commitment to this issue is both personal and lifelong.
As a young adult, I served as an outreach minister through my church and completed studies at Bethel Bible Institute and Hartford Seminary.
Professionally, I worked with geriatric patients, individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and later as a radiology technologist at a hospital for special care.
Community service has always been central to my life.
Since moving to South Carolina, I have continued this work through child advocacy.
I am involved with Save the Children Action Network and the Early Childhood Common Agenda, a statewide coalition advocating for young children and families. Our priorities include access to high-quality early childhood education, comprehensive health care, early intervention services, housing stability, and nutritious food for all children.
I want to be clear and transparent: My advocacy work is voluntary and motivated by lived experience and a belief that children deserve better. I receive no financial benefit from policies related to school nutrition.
Children are South Carolina’s most valuable asset. Protecting their mental and physical well-being should never be controversial. When we feed children, we are not just addressing hunger, we are investing in education, health, and the future of our state.
No child should have to try to learn while hungry. I know, because I was one of them.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/summer-meals.jpg,,,2026-01-27 13:57:30.963543

(Photo by Jerry Redfern for Capital & Main)
On evened-numbered years, New Mexico’s legislative sessions focus almost exclusively on budgetary issues, which puts the state’s oil and gas industry front and center, as revenues from the oilfields make up about a third of the state’s general fund budget, and contribute millions more to its permanent funds.
The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association sits at the middle of numerous political debates each legislative session as the biggest representative of the state’s most lucrative industry.
NMOGA President and CEO Missi Currier has led the group since 2023, as state legislators have pumped fossil fuel revenues into record state budgets. During that time, some studies have shown that oilfield air pollution emissions have risen as the Democratic-majority Legislature has passed little legislation to impose greater oversight or extract more tax dollars.
This interview was originally recorded Jan. 22 for New Mexico PBS’ weekly news program New Mexico in Focus.

This interview has been edited for clarity and concision. It originally published on Capital & Main.
Capital & Main: What is the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association hoping for this particular legislative session? 
Missi Currier:  First, we would love to see the Reclamation Fund pass. A bill recently filed by Rep. Mark Murphy [R-Chaves] and Rep. Debbie Sariñana [D-Bernalillo] would refund the Reclamation Fund. Oil and gas companies have actually been paying a conservation tax on every single barrel of oil produced in the state of New Mexico since the ’70s, and a percentage of that conservation tax has gone to the Reclamation Fund. What the Reclamation Fund does is if a bad actor or a company of some sort goes out of business and they didn’t clean up their well and they didn’t reclamate the land, the Reclamation Fund is there, which is funded by oil and gas to ensure that the land can be returned back to its native state.
The Reclamation Fund does have a lot of money in it right now, not only from the oil and gas companies that are paying directly into it, but also some federal funds. But we’d really like to see the Reclamation Fund beefed back up, ensuring that the full percentage is going into the Reclamation Fund. A few years ago, some of the funding was lost because it was pulled from the Reclamation Fund into the New Mexico General Fund. So, just making sure that those dollars are going back for their original intent is something we’re excited about.
 The Oil and Gas Conservation Tax that oil and gas producers pay goes to a couple of different things. It goes to the Reclamation Fund, but doesn’t part of that also go to the operation of the Oil Conservation Division?
It does. It helps there. And there’s also funds there to help with education about energy throughout the state. So, we’re primarily focused on the reclamation side of it and not changing where the rest of the dollars are.
The bill says that currently about 20% of the conservation tax goes to the Reclamation Fund, but will bump to 50% next year, 75% in 2028 and 100% in 2029, which means all of the conservation tax will be going to reclamation. But what about the money that previously went to the Oil Conservation Division or to education? The Oil Conservation Division is kind of the main policing body for the oil and gas industry in the state, so it almost looks a bit like a defunding action there.
Not a defunding, just a shifting of the funds. We have worked with the Oil Conservation Division, and I believe Rep. Murphy as well as Rep. Sariñana are having conversations with their fellow legislators to better understand how we can ensure that the Oil Conservation Division doesn’t lose any money for the purposes that they’re in place for. Because we want a fully funded agency. That’s incredibly important for a lot of reasons, and that’s one of the reasons that there is a stair step in that bill, so that we can incrementally work our way into not losing money from the Oil Conservation Division and ensuring other dollars are there to backfill it. In parts of the original legislation, you might have seen that the shift would have happened right away. This legislation allows for the stair steps so that those dollars don’t go anywhere.
So then where’s the makeup funding going to come from for the Oil Conservation Division?
So that will come, of course. The [legislators] will take a look at how they best want to fund from the General Fund, and there might be dollars that are shifted around there to ensure that there is not a loss of funding. And, of course, we all hope that production stays high so the state can continue to enjoy higher profits so that the dollars are there.
Last session, it came up a lot both in advertising and from legislators themselves, mostly on the right side of the aisle, that the oil and gas industry was out of favor in New Mexico and out of favor with the New Mexico Legislature. But at the same time, last year the Oil and Gas Day at the House passed unanimously in favor of the oil and gas industry. And honestly, for the last several years, very, very few regulatory changes that would affect the oil and gas industry have passed — much less made it out of committee hearings. Why do you say [the industry] is somehow out of favor?
Last session, we worked on 30 bills that would have had a direct and negative impact to oil and gas and, ultimately, the state of New Mexico. We understand that when we are one of the largest industries in the state, there will always be a large focus on us. We appreciate that and we understand that.
What we do get frustrated by is, because of the legislative and regulatory burden that we’re constantly facing, it often feels as if we’re fighting a battle as opposed to finding ways to collaborate to move the state forward. And that’s something that’s incredibly frustrating for our industry.
But you essentially won. You say there were 30 bills roughly that came up last session that you were fighting against, and there were maybe two that passed. 
We can certainly have detractors, but that doesn’t mean that we’re always losing.
Well, let’s put it this way: Back on Tuesday, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in her State of the State speech was calling for working across the aisle, people working together.  Less than an hour after she finished her speech, the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association [sent an email] saying that ‘Santa Fe [the state capital] needs a reality check.’
What is the reality check that you’re talking about, considering — as just said — that you actually have a pretty good track record of getting what you want passed, passed and what you don’t want passed, not passed. 
We are, and we’re very proud of this, but New Mexico is currently the No. 1 emission reducing state in the country. That’s really cool. That’s something that we should all be proud of, but it also means that we are one of the worst states for education. We’re one of the worst states for crime. We’re one of the worst states for health care. So when there continues to be an incredibly large focus on industry, when we’re doing our part, we just want to continue to remind our legislators and others that there are big problems in this state that we would hope that we would focus on and find bipartisan ways to move those forward without it constantly being a battle over the industry that does so much for the state, not only economically, but even environmentally.
To back up a bit,  a study [last September] by the Rhodium Group [made clear] that greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas industry in New Mexico have dramatically increased between 2020 and through the end of 2024 and projected up through 2028. Where does the idea that emissions are diminishing come from? 
Well, I haven’t seen the study…but what I can speak to is since 2020 production has actually increased in New Mexico, so with an increase of production, of course there might be an increase of emissions. We’ve also found ways to further diversify the economy in the Permian. We also have several other industries that also have emission emitters. Even Bernalillo County, for example, can have emissions that sometimes make them look just as bad as the Permian.
So with that in mind, I’m very proud of the companies and the work that they’re doing. As you know, the governor’s executive order that came out in 2019 that says that 98% of gas has to be captured at the wellhead, all of those changes have to take place by 2027 and over 95% of our companies are already achieving that a year ahead of the goal. There’s been several studies that show that while emissions in production are up in the Permian, it also shows that emissions are coming down, especially on the New Mexico side because of innovations in technology.
So are there emissions? Yes, because we live in an industrial society. But that certainly doesn’t mean that vast improvements haven’t been made and that our companies do better each and every day to ensure that we’re doing the best that we can.
The study from the Rhodium Group [is] just one. Another one is numbers collected by the New Mexico Environment Department at their air monitoring stations in the Permian Basin and by other groups that have worked down there that show at the very least, flat emissions or problems with ozone in that region. Or increasing. That’s been going on for at least a half-dozen years or more. 
The only thing that I’ll end with there is that as Environment Department Secretary James Kenny has said, so many of the reports that he’s showing indicate the numbers are improving in the Permian. So let’s visit more… when we’ve got time to compare reports and see if we can get more on the same page. I’m happy to have that conversation.
Your ads regularly tout the amount of money that the oil and gas industry pays toward the state economy, with emphasis on education and child welfare. But burning these same fossil fuels leads to a warmer climate for those kids in the future and more difficult times for them to live in. So how do you square that particular circle of the oil and gas industry — yes, helping pay for things in the state that help kids — but at the same time make it more difficult down the line?
I don’t think it’s a circle to square. I think it’s very obvious that technology, science and innovation are the answer to that question. We will absolutely get to an energy transition one day, and we are working toward that. But to get to an energy transition, you must first go through an energy expansion. We believe in oil and responsible oil and gas production. We know that renewables like wind and solar and others are going to be incredibly important. And with the demands that we have on the electric grid right now, which are continuing to grow, we need all of those energies to ensure that New Mexico remains a stable place to live, work and play.
So will we transition from oil and gas one day? Yes. Is it going to happen in our lifetime? Probably not. And until innovation, technology and science allows us to move completely away from oil and gas, we will continue to produce in affordable, reliable and sustainable ways.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Redfern-Permian-Flaring-1-1024x656.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 13:57:30.963543

(Photo by Michael Smith/Getty Images)A bill to place the Ten Commandments in Hoosier public schools cleared its first legislative hurdle Tuesday — but in a scaled-back form that leaves decisions over whether to display the religious text up to local schools.
House Bill 1086, authored by Rep. Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, advanced 8-3 from the House Education Committee in a party-line vote after members amended out earlier language that would have explicitly required display of the Ten Commandments in classrooms and school libraries.
The measure now heads to the House floor, with a full chamber vote due by the end of this week.

The latest draft of the legislation makes display optional and instead adds the Ten Commandments to Indiana’s list of “protected writings” in education law. The designation governs how certain historical documents may be maintained, referenced and displayed in public schools.
Supporters described the bill as a way to acknowledge what they view as the Ten Commandments’ historical significance and called it an “important” teaching tool for young people. Opponents, though, warned it blurs constitutional boundaries between church and state.
The debate comes amid ongoing national scrutiny of efforts to place the Ten Commandments in public schools. Courts are currently weighing challenges to a Louisiana law requiring classroom displays, while Texas is defending a similar statute. Lawmakers in other states, including South Carolina and Ohio, have also introduced related proposals.
And earlier this month, Hoosier officials sought to lift a decades-old ban on a Ten Commandments monument at the Indiana Statehouse, asking a judge to dissolve a long-standing injunction that has blocked the monument’s installation since the 1980s.
“Without the basis of the Ten Commandments, we would not have a Declaration of Independence. We would not have a U.S. Constitution. It is the basis on which those foundational documents were built. … It is the basis of our legal system,” said Timothy Huggins, a Greenwood resident who testified in favor of the bill.
“Every law that you pass has its foundation somewhere in one of those Ten Commandments,” he continued. “We need to have that up. We need to have it posted. We need to have the opportunity to speak in our public schools about the foundation of our society, the foundation of our legal system, the foundation of moral right and wrong.”
‘A no brainer’
Indiana law already identifies 15 “protected writings,” including the U.S. Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers and Frederick Douglass’ 1852 speech “What to a Slave Is the Fourth of July?” 
Under existing statute, schools must keep copies of those protected writings in their libraries and can’t censor any content “based on religious references.” Students must also be allowed to reference any of the protected texts in coursework without penalty.
House Bill 1086 would add the Ten Commandments to that list.
Schools would also be required to maintain a copy of the Ten Commandments in their library collections, alongside other protected writings, but the document would not have to be posted on classroom walls unless local officials choose to do so.
“It does not have to be posted, doesn’t have to be hanging up,” Davis said. “It just has to be maintained.”
Indiana officials seek to lift decades-old ban on Ten Commandments monument at Statehouse

The bill would not permit a principal or teacher to “read the Ten Commandments aloud when students are present,” however. That stipulation does not apply to the other protected writings in state law.
Davis and other supporters argued that adding the Ten Commandments to the protected writings list recognizes its “historical role” rather than imposing religious instruction.
“Some of them can be,” Davis said when asked whether the existing protected writings are religious. 
Supporters who testified described the Ten Commandments as foundational to Western law and moral instruction.
Ryan McCann, executive director of the Indiana Family Institute, called the principles in the text “basic underpinnings of morality within Western civilization.”
“We really think this is a no brainer to encourage this kind of morality within public schools,” McCann said.
“And it’s really not new in American history,” he added, citing notable public displays of the Ten Commandments.
“You go to the United States Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. — Ten Commandments. You go to Library of Congress — there’s the Ten Commandments. You go to other other places throughout the nation, it’s the Ten Commandments,” McCann said. “They’re really the basis of morality and understanding that we have in our country … and how to live together as citizens.”
Bre’Anna Donaldson with the Indiana School Boards Association said the amendment resolved earlier concerns from the group, which is now neutral on the bill.
“All our concerns that we had with the original bill,” she said, “we no longer have.”
Critics warn of church-state concerns
But opponents argued the bill still risks violating the constitutional separation of church and state, even with the mandate removed.
Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, said he remained concerned that the updated draft simply shifts pressure onto individual educators.
“I frankly think this amendment does nothing but cause confusion and try to distract us from the real point,” he said.
Zachary Parrish, the co-founder of Secular Education Association, noted that courts have repeatedly rejected efforts to place the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms.
“The debate around the Ten Commandments and public schools has been long settled,” Parrish said, citing U.S. Supreme Court precedent. “The intent of this bill is very clear.”

Representatives of multiple faith groups — including Jewish, Muslim and Christian leaders — testified that the bill could alienate students of minority faiths and oversimplify a religious text that requires deeper interpretation.
“As someone who teaches about the Ten Commandments to students every year, I can’t help but wonder, which Ten Commandments is the bill asking schools to display?” asked Tim McNinch, an Old Testament professor at the Indianapolis-based Christian Theological Seminary. “Their meaning needs to be interpreted.”
Rabbi Aaron Spiegel of the Greater Indianapolis Multifaith Alliance said the measure risks “religious favoritism.”
“Public schools are not appropriate places to address these critical questions,” Spiegel said. “America is strengthened by pluralism.”
American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana attorney Samantha Bresnahan further warned that allowing teachers to post the Ten Commandments could still be perceived as government endorsement of religion.
“Posting the Ten Commandments in the classroom will do” precisely what the Establishment Clause forbids, she said.
“All students, regardless of their faith, should feel safe and welcome in our public schools. Displaying the Ten Commandments would expose students, daily, to a government-presented religious message which can be perceived as coercive to impressionable students,” Bresnahan told the House committee. “Religious freedom is best protected when belief is chosen freely — not directed by the government.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A project to build new trans-Hudson River tunnels will run out of money in 10 days amid a funding freeze launched during last year’s government shutdown, forcing a costly work stoppage for one of the nation’s most critical infrastructure projects, officials said Tuesday.
Work on the Hudson tunnel project, overseen by the Gateway Development Commission, will stop on Feb. 6, months after Russell Vought, director of the federal budget and management office, said billions in funding to that project and others in New York would be frozen to ensure money did not flow to “unconstitutional DEI principles.”
“This project will shut down. We don’t know how long it will be delayed. We don’t know if it’s permanent, if it’ll be temporary, how many months it’ll be set back … but this is what we do know: shutting it down will cost at least a billion dollars in taxpayer money,” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-05) said at a commission meeting Tuesday. “What a complete waste.”
How crews keep the aging Hudson River rail tunnels operating

The tunnel project is critical to regional mass transit and the northeast’s economy. NJ Transit’s northeast corridor line, the busiest commuter rail line in the nation, runs through those tunnels, as do Amtrak and Long Island Railroad trains.
Once funding runs out, work will stop at four of five project sites. A concrete casing project at Hudson Yards would continue because its federal funding flows through a separate grant that was not frozen, Gateway Development Commission CEO Tom Prendergast said.
On Tuesday, state officials warned the stoppage would immediately cost more than 1,000 jobs and risk $1 billion in funding that has already been spent on the project, plus imperil the 95,000 jobs and billions more in economic activity the project is expected to create over its life.
The stoppage will also make the region more vulnerable to disruptions in the existing 116-year-old trans-Hudson tunnels. A closure in the dilapidated tunnels that still bear damage from Hurricane Sandy could cost the region $100 million in economic activity each day, Gottheimer said.
“The president’s refusal to fund the Gateway Tunnel project is not only an illegal attack on New Jersey but also shows a reckless disregard for our economy and the livelihoods of working families,” Gov. Mikie Sherrill (D) said in a statement, adding, “New Jersey will fight tooth and nail for our hard-earned tax dollars and this essential project.”
Gateway Development Commission officials said they had acceded to the administration’s requests in hopes of lifting the funding freeze, but their efforts have yielded no relief.
In the meantime, lines of credit the project had tapped to stay operational amid the funding freeze have run dry, said Prendergast.
“Despite responding to all the requests from U.S. DOT in a timely, transparent, responsible way, it means nothing — none of that means anything — when faced with the harsh reality that President Trump himself made the decision to cut off federal funding,” said Alicia Glen, the commission’s New York co-chair.
Politico was first to report the impending stoppage.

Federal officials paused funding for the project in October in an apparent bid to pressure Democratic congressional leaders into ending what would become the longest federal government shutdown in American history, eclipsing the ignominious record set during Trump’s first term.
In an unsigned statement released the day the freeze was announced, the U.S. Department of Transportation attacked Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), charging the shutdown would extend the department’s review.
Days later, President Donald Trump said funding for the project — which Congress approved as part of President Joe Biden’s bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act — was “terminated” along with other projects in Democrat-led states.
The White House indicated Tuesday that its opposition to Gateway funding stems from a recent feud with Senate Democrats over funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a fight that could lead to a new federal government shutdown later this week.
“It’s Chuck Schumer and Democrats who are standing in the way of a deal for the Gateway Tunnel Project by refusing to negotiate with the Trump administration. There is nothing stopping Democrats from prioritizing the interests of Americans over illegal aliens and getting this project back on track,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said.
“There is only one person who can get it back on track, and that is President Trump, make no mistake about it,” Schumer said Tuesday. “He has tried to escape responsibility, but listen to his own words.”
Union officials slammed the funding freeze and the impending work stoppage it will create, warning blue-collar workers who made up a significant portion of Trump’s base would be among the first to suffer.
“President Trump needs to stop the war against unions and American working families, middle-class families in particular,” said Robert Brunotte, a field representative with the Laborers’ International Union Local 79. “He needs to fund this project immediately without hesitation, and he needs to keep us in the tristate area working.”
Others warned that a delay could worsen congestion in the region as tunnel issues make trains increasingly unreliable.
Even if the funding is eventually restored and the work stoppage is lifted, there’s no guarantee the commission would keep its best-performing contractors.
“Money talks,” said John Mooney, a member of Ironworkers Local 580’s examining board. “Bullsh*t walks”

“You can see from the people who either voted no or present that there’s a super right wing
faction that would prefer to continue doing it the caucus way,” McGaugh said in an interview after the vote.
McGaugh said she will try to restore the primary through an amendment to the bill when it reaches the House floor. 
The House approved a bill re-establishing the primary last year but it died in the state Senate.
Missouri conducted its first presidential primary in 1988 but did not have a regular primary until 2000. The law authorizing the primary was repealed in 2022.
In 2024, Republicans met in caucuses to select the delegates that renominated Donald Trump, while the Democratic Party held a private primary on a Saturday morning to start the process that nominated Kamala Harris.
Under the caucus system, adherents to a party must attend a meeting where voters are grouped based on the candidate they prefer. In the Republican Party, a majority of the meeting can choose all the delegates; at Democratic Party caucuses, every candidate with 15% or more of the voters gets a share of the delegates elected at that level.
While Missouri’s primary has, at times, determined the delegate pledges, by 2012, when former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum won, it was only a popularity contest.
State Rep. John Voss, a Republican from Cape Girardeau, sponsored the amendment that stripped the primary from the bill. He said the reinstatement may be lost in the bill that makes several other changes to election procedure at the request of local election authorities.
“It should be something as a standalone piece of legislation,” Voss said. “I’m also concerned with the $9 million fiscal notes that’s attached to that, given our current financial situation.”
State Rep. David Tyson Smith, a Columbia Democrat, accused unnamed opponents of “browbeating individuals” on the committee to remove the primary.
The primary was repealed in a big elections bill in 2022, Smith said, and many legislators didn’t even know it was in the bill. 
“I didn’t like how that was handled then and I was glad to see that we were putting it back in,” Smith said. “And I’m again, disappointed that it’s being kind of muscled out of here.”
While he voted against Voss’ amendment, Smith voted for the final version of the bill.
The committee also removed another provision in the bill which would have moved the line protecting voters from solicitations like last-minute candidate appeals or petition signature gathering from 25 feet to 50 feet from the entrance to polling stations.
The bill would also change where a small number of voters, eligible under federal law to register on election day, must report to cast a ballot. Instead of a local polling station, the bill would change the location to offices of the election authority.
Boone County residents line up in October 2024 for no-excuse absentee voting at the Boone County Government Center in Columbia (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
The clerks wanted that change for better election management and they wanted to extend the no-excuse absentee, or early, voting period, McGaugh said.
The ability to cast a ballot anytime in the weeks prior to Election Day gives clerks the chance to help voters with issues in their registration or other problems that could prevent voting, said McGaugh, who is a former clerk.
The early voting period was included in the 2022 bill that ended the presidential primary. That law also required voters to show a government-issued ID card, with photo, date of birth and an expiration date, prior to voting. 
Republicans at the time opposed early voting and wrote the bill to end it if a court struck down the identification requirement. It was upheld by a Cole County judge in November 2024 but the decision was appealed and a ruling is pending from the Missouri Supreme Court.
McGaugh’s bill would not remove the link between the provisions of law.
The early voting period has proven immensely popular, with thousands of voters daily taking advantage of the convenience. 
The presidential primary occurs just weeks before April municipal elections. Clerks were willing to support it if it was on a convenient date and lawmakers extended the no-excuse absentee period to four weeks, McGaugh said.
“They asked me to put it as part of the bill in exchange for the additional weeks of no excuse, which has been an absolute win,” McGaugh said. “It stretches out the days for people, the voters loved it, and so I was happy to have the bill for them.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/McGaugh-03042025-1024x614.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 12:57:12.425923

The move opens a clearer path for Washtenaw County Prosecuting Attorney Eli Savit, Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald, and public defender William Noakes, who are also seeking the Democratic nomination.
McDonald, however, is starting to make real waves in the race with two hallowed union nods from the United Auto Workers, which said they would support her on Monday, and the endorsement of the Michigan Education Association earlier in the race. That’s on top of other union nods McDonald has received thus far.

For Totten, he no longer saw a viable path to the nomination, which will be awarded in part during a spring endorsement convention and later at the party’s annual summer convention, when they will formally nominate the 2026 slate. With McDonald racking up two important unions, the lack of momentum became clearer this week.
“I am deeply grateful for the extraordinary support I have received across Michigan,” Totten said in a statement. “Thoughought this past year on the campaign trail — and throughout my career — I have been guided by a sense of mission. We live in an unprecedented moment, with the president attacking our democracy while the rich and powerful accumulate even more power at the expense of everyone else.”
Totten said state attorneys general stand on the frontlines against those abuses, and that he was uniquely qualified to lead in these times. However, he will not be doing so in 2026.
He said he would support the nominee, but did not issue an endorsement for McDonald, Savit or Noakes.
On the Republican side of the race are defense attorney Kevin Kijewski and Eaton County Prosecutor Doug Lloyd.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) An Iowa House bill banning the use of eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines advanced from a Senate subcommittee Tuesday, but senators intend to amend the bill with their own language. 
Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, said he plans to amend the bill with language from his own property rights bill. 
Klimesh held a hearing on House File 2104, a bill passed by the House in response to ongoing conflict in the state over property rights and a carbon sequestration pipeline. 
“The Senate’s approach is to find a way that we can both honor property rights for those folks that want to say no and for those folks that want to say yes, while continuing to build linear infrastructure in the state,” Klimesh said, speaking to reporters after the subcommittee hearing.

Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, sat on the subcommittee and said she was “surprised” Klimesh had called a subcommittee on the bill, considering his plans to run a different piece of legislation. 
“That was the biggest bait and switch I’ve ever seen,” Petersen said at the close of the subcommittee after Klimesh shared his plans to amend the bill. 
Klimesh introduced two bills the week prior related to the issue, one that would allow pipeline operators to widen the corridor in their route proposals and to find alternate easement parcels to avoid the use of eminent domain. The other bill would place a severance tax on sequestered carbon dioxide.
Klimesh’s bills have been supported by the corn and ethanol industries, who are in favor of the Summit Carbon Solutions proposed carbon sequestration pipeline project that would run through Iowa. 
The opportunity to widen the corridor, they argued, would allow the project to move forward in the state, while a CO2 pipeline eminent domain ban would stop the project.  
Landowners opposed to the Summit pipeline argue a ban, via HF 2104,  is the only way to protect private property rights from a project they believe was wrongly given the power of eminent domain by the Iowa Utilities Commission. 
Lawmakers advance resolution asking voters to put eminent domain restrictions in SD constitution

“Nothing in this bill prevents or prohibits construction of a carbon capture pipeline,” Peg Rasmussen, a Montgomery County affected landowner, said in the subcommittee. “What is in this bill, is private property rights protection from the heavy hand of government.” 
Several representatives from Iowa Laborers Local 177, spoke at the subcommittee against the eminent domain ban and said the project, which has been unable to start construction, would employ roughly 2,000 construction workers. 
“This is the same bill that’s being introduced year after year after year,” Richie Schmidt, Local 177’s president said. “It doesn’t go anywhere. Workers are suffering.” 
House lawmakers passed a similar bill last year, but it did not advance in the Senate. The Senate passed a different House bill restricting the use of eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines, but Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed the legislation. 
Cynthia Hansen, a Shelby County landowner, said the bill has “nothing to do” with stopping the creation of labor jobs. 
“The pipeline can still be built, it just has to be built on voluntary easements, not on eminent domain,” Hansen said. 
Fixing the ‘confrontation’ of the permitting process 
Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and Iowa Corn Growers Association have been in favor of the pipeline project, as a carbon sequestration pipeline would enable Iowa ethanol plants to participate in the ultra-low carbon ethanol market, which the groups argue would also give a needed boost to the corn market. 
Colin Gorton, on behalf of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said the group was in favor of an effort to widen easement corridors, but was also interested in “improving Iowa’s permitting process on the front end.” 
Gorton said the process now requires projects to “throw a dart at the wall” when proposing the route. He suggested amending Iowa’s permitting process to allow operators to talk to landowners before suggesting a route, in hope of devising a route with willing landowners. 
“It’s really designed to create confrontation, and that’s not something that we support,” Gorton said of the current process. 
A lobbyist from Summit echoed Gorton’s call for an amendment to the early stages of the process. 
Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, who sat on the subcommittee and also chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, where the bill is headed, said he hopes to find a balance between protecting landowners and not impeding on “critical infrastructure and development.” 
“Let me be abundantly clear, we have to do something this session to protect landowners and landowner rights,” Bousselot said. “We have to do that.” 
Klimesh declined to answer Petersen’s comments at the onset of the committee on whether or not he intended to amend the bill. Petersen said she wanted to sign in support of the bill, but “not with an amendment that we didn’t discuss.” 
Klimesh said HF 2104 will be in the full committee Wednesday with an amendment, and said there will be a subcommittee hearing on the bill he filed, Senate File 2067.
Klimesh said the comments he has heard on this issue and the eminent domain ban are of “the utmost importance” to him as he seeks to “find common ground.” 
“We are all concerned about their property rights, everybody in the Senate is, everybody in both chambers is,” Klimesh said. “It’s time for us to find a solution, to find a solution that allows us to get ourselves, and dig ourselves, out of the box we currently put ourselves in by the overregulating of this corridor.”

A judge last week placed restrictions on the operations of the mine amid an ongoing lawsuit. (Southern Environmental Law Center)A Limestone county judge Friday ordered a quarry owner to make changes to address complaints from residents about noise and traffic in the area.
Limestone County Circuit Court Judge Matthew Huggins ordered the mining company, Grayson Carter & Son Contracting, Inc., to place a rock crusher used for quarry operations at least 1,200 feet away from  residents of Belle Mina and churches, plaintiffs in the case, located near the mining site.
The judge also prohibits the company from placing lights “by the line of sight over the berm” near the mine, operating in a way that creates a lot of noise in the evenings and blocking traffic with their trucks along the road.

The decision came after a lawsuit filed against the company by local residents and churches, alleging that the quarry amounts to a public and private nuisance.
“We’re very pleased the judge heard the evidence and applied the law to limit the unnecessary mayhem community members are enduring because of this nuisance,” said Sarah Stokes, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, in a statement from a news release published Monday. “Belle Mina residents — just like any community — are entitled to the safe, peaceful use of their homes and property. They did nothing to deserve this chaos. That’s why they intend to fight this to the end.”
Attorneys for the defendants declined comment for the article.
Brad Vice, a local resident and plaintiff in the lawsuit said in a statement in the news release that he was grateful for “this immediate relief from the nightmare we’ve been living for months.”
“I’m worried about my child’s health and my family’s well-being enduring constant noise, air pollution, and sleepless nights,” he said. “I am hopeful the court will continue to take the harm this quarry is causing seriously as we continue this fight for our rights to live a normal life on our own property.”
Nina Perez, another plaintiff who suffers from asthma and said the quarry is forcing her to move, said “no one deserves to have their lives upended because a rock quarry invaded their community.”
The order will remain in place until the court rules on the merits of the lawsuit A trial is scheduled for April, according to a news release.
Plaintiffs alleged in the lawsuit that the mine is creating dust that pollutes the air that affects their properties, generates truck traffic, produces noise and uses heavy lighting that is annoying them as the company is harvesting limestone from the site.
The plaintiffs also alleged in their request for a preliminary injunction that, because of the type of ground in the area, the mine increases the chances that sinkholes will develop.
Residents and nearby churches made largely similar arguments in the lawsuit.
Judge Huggins denied the plaintiffs’ request to stop the mine from operating altogether, saying he did not find “sufficient evidence to believe that the existence of the quarry poses an imminent or legitimate threat of subsidence or sinkhole formation.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Belle-Mina-quarry-for-newsletter.jpg,,,2026-01-27 12:57:12.425923

Gretchen Whitmer announced Tuesday that her father, Richard Whitmer, a former state official and health insurance executive, has died.
Whitmer said in a statement that her father died overnight and remembered him as a mentor, steadfast supporter and the person who encouraged her to pursue a career in public service.
“He held a lot of impressive positions in his long life,” Whitmer said. “But for me, he was just dad.”
Richard Whitmer served as commerce secretary in the 1970s under then-Gov. William Milliken, a Republican. He later joined Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, where he rose to become chief executive officer.
In her statement, the Democratic governor credited her father with shaping her confidence and values, recalling his presence at key moments throughout her life — from her first speech in elementary school to her addresses as governor.
“He was the one who always saw my potential and believed in me,” she said.

Whitmer said her father encouraged her to consider public service while she was a student at Michigan State University, steering her toward an internship at the state Capitol after she initially dreamed of a career in sports broadcasting.
“I haven’t looked back since,” she said.
She also reflected on his role as a grandfather, describing him as quick to laugh, generous with advice and deeply proud of his children and grandchildren.
Richard Whitmer is survived by his sister; his three children, Gretchen, Richard and Liz; and seven grandchildren.
The governor said she is grieving but grateful for the time they shared and the lessons he passed on.

Vern Buchanan, via U.S. House, has announced plans to retire after 20 years in Congress.Florida Republican U.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, who has represented the Sarasota area and other parts of Southwest Florida for nearly 20 years, announced Tuesday that he will not run for re-election in November.
The sitting vice chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Buchanan saw 51 of his bills and legislative initiatives signed into law under four presidents. He particularly stood out in championing Florida’s environment, working to combat red tide, safeguard water quality, and protect manatees and coastal ecosystems.
He frequently cosponsored bipartisan bills to permanently ban oil drilling off the coast of Florida, aiming to protect the state’s tourism, environment, and military training areas.
Buchanan is considered one of the biggest supporters of animal rights in Congress. He was co-sponsor of the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture (PACT) Act in 2019, which was the first federal laws targeting extreme acts of animal cruelty — such as crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, or impaling — occurring in interstate commerce or on federal property.
And he was the only member of the U.S. House of Representatives to receive the Humane Society’s national “Legislator of the Year Award” twice.
“Serving the people of Southwest Florida has been the honor of my lifetime,” Buchanan said in a written statement.
“Every achievement worth doing began with listening to my constituents and fighting for their priorities. I came to Congress to solve problems, to fight for working families and to help ensure this country remains a place where opportunity is available to everyone willing to work for it. After 20 years of service, I believe it’s the right time to pass the torch and begin a new chapter in my life.”
Buchanan was already a successful business owner when he first decided to run for Congress in 2006, having operated a number of car dealerships, and served as chairman of the Florida Chamber of Commerce. NewsNation reported a year ago that he had a projected wealth of nearly $250 million.
Buchanan’s toughest election was his first one — and it was controversial.
The seat was open that year after Republican incumbent Katherine Harris stepped down to run for U.S. Senate (she lost to Democrat Bill Nelson). Buchanan ran against Democrat Christine Jennings.
The Florida Division of Elections certified Buchanan as the winner by 369 votes out of more than 238,000 counted.
But Jennings filed a formal protest, claiming that there were approximately 18,000 “undervotes” in Sarasota County, the biggest county in the 16th Congressional District and where Jennings had run the strongest. These ballots, mostly cast on electronic machines, contained votes cast for other offices but not in the House race.
Jennings filed a lawsuit in state court, but lost. As the Sarasota-Herald Tribune reported at the time, the judge ruled that her arguments about the possibility of lost votes were “conjecture” that didn’t warrant overriding the trade secrets of the voting machine company.
Jennings then contested the results in Congress. After a 10-month investigation by the Government Accountability Office provided “further confirmation that the machines accurately recorded election ballots,” Congress in February 2008 dismissed her challenge.
Florida’s 16th Congressional District includes parts of eastern Hillsborough County and all of Manatee County and is heavily Republican in its make-up. Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris by 18 points in the district in November 2024, while Buchanan won his re-election that same night over Democrat Jan Schneider by 19 points.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/buchanan-1024x668.jpg,,,2026-01-27 12:57:12.425923

(Photo by Otto Kitsinger/Idaho Capital Sun)A federal judge in Idaho on Friday largely rejected the state’s attempts to dismiss a lawsuit challenging a 2025 state immigration law. 
The legal battle against House Bill 83 will continue with most of the arguments against its constitutionality intact, although the judge tossed out one of the plaintiffs’ challenges. 
U.S. District of Idaho Judge Amanda Brailsford on Jan. 23 ruled on new motions to dismiss a lawsuit led by the ACLU of Idaho against HB 83. The law was approved by the Idaho Legislature and signed by Gov. Brad Little in 2025 and created new state-level immigration crimes of “illegal entry” and “illegal re-entry.” 
ACLU of Idaho sues state for new immigration enforcement bill just signed into law

The crimes would target those who aren’t authorized to live in the U.S. who enter Idaho or who re-enter Idaho after a prior deportation, and would apply to those who are convicted or suspected of committing another crime. 
The lawsuit was filed in March on behalf of people who are undocumented who live or work in Idaho and organizations that support Idaho residents who are undocumented. Brailsford previously issued an injunction, which blocked parts of the law from going into effect while the case makes its way through court, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. The block remains in effect.
 ACLU argues new crimes outlined in House Bill 83 are unconstitutional

Attorneys with the ACLU have argued the crimes created in House Bill 83 were unconstitutional for three primary reasons: they superseded what is typically solely the federal government’s role to enforce federal immigration crimes; the definitions in the law are overly vague and violate rights to due process; and they violate the U.S. Constitution’s Commerce Clause, by regulating people’s entry into Idaho and movement across state and national borders. 
Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador filed court documents in May, asking the judge to dismiss the lawsuit. He largely rejected the ACLU’s claims against the law’s constitutionality and the legal standing for the individuals or organizations to bring the challenge at all. 
In the ruling, Brailsford accepted one of Labrador’s arguments that the ACLU couldn’t adequately show a violation of the Commerce Clause, and she dismissed that claim. 
Labrador also challenged the other constitutionality claims made by the ACLU, but Brailsford rejected the rest of his motions. As the lawsuit moves forward, the court will evaluate whether the law is overly vague and whether it supersedes federal authority. 
Brailsford wrote that much of the arguments made in Labrador’s later requests to dismiss mirrored arguments she’d already rejected in her ruling on a hearing held April 10 on the injunction.

 Idaho Attorney General’s Office challenges standing of plaintiffs in ACLU lawsuit

Labrador also challenged the standing of the undocumented residents and the nonprofits named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. 
In court filings, the attorney general’s office argues that most of the individual plaintiffs would only have standing if they’d violated the illegal entry law by entering Idaho through the Canadian border or directly from another country via aircraft. Brailsford disagreed with this interpretation of the law. 
“In support, Defendants characterize Illegal Entry as applying in only ‘two circumstances,’ i.e., where an alien enters Idaho from Canada or from a foreign country via aircraft but not through a port of entry,” Brailsford wrote. “This characterization of Illegal Entry, however, ignores the statute’s plain language, which provides that an alien commits Illegal Entry if he ‘enters or attempts to enter this state at any location other than a lawful port of entry.’”
“Obviously, ‘any location’ is broader than the Canadian border or an airport,” she continued. “Defendants’ strained interpretation of Illegal Entry does not defeat Plaintiffs’ standing to challenge Illegal Entry.” 
The judge also upheld the standing of the nonprofits, Idaho Organization of Resource Council and  the Alliance of Idaho. However, Brailsford indicated the Alliance’s standing may be tenuous. 
“… the Court concludes Alliance has alleged standing. Standing, however, ‘must be supported at each stage of the litigation in the same manner as any other essential elements of the case …,” she wrote.  
Based on the individual circumstances of the undocumented plaintiffs, Brailsford ruled that two of them had legal standing to challenge the “illegal reentry” crime, but agreed with Labrador that the remaining three do not.

A news release from Rhoden’s office said the damage tally is from Custer, Fall River and Pennington counties.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A first-in-the-nation bill to devise a uniform anti-school shooter plan lost language Tuesday that would have allowed professors and teaching assistants to openly carry guns on public college and university campuses.
The new version of the bill, unanimously approved Tuesday morning by the House Judiciary Committee, no longer touches the hot-button issue of campus carry, unlike its Senate version still awaiting a committee hearing.
Instead, HB 757 addresses classroom door lock requirements, expands a statewide program of arming trained K-12 school staff into colleges and universities, and formulates active-shooter plans and threat-assessment models statewide.
“In the whole United States, there is not a single state that has a uniform response, a uniform requirement for mental health, or stress, or how to engage, or how to spot or see that his could be happening on campus at that moment,” said bill sponsor Rep. Michelle Salzman, an Escambia County Republican.
So, she continued, she worked for more than six months with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, the state university system, first responders, teachers, and the Florida Sheriff’s Association to craft the 39-page bill.
It was inspired by the April shooting at Florida State University that left two dead and five wounded. Salzman, who was working to get her FSU master’s degree during the 2025 spring semester, described sitting in her Capitol office while messaging with fellow students trapped within classrooms.
“It was tough,” she said. But as a lawmaker and student, Salzman described feeling “uniquely” positioned to make a change.
State law now prohibits bringing guns on university campuses, whether openly or concealed.
One of the many jarring details that emerged in the aftermath of the attack was a near-fatal flaw: some of FSU’s classroom doors didn’t lock from the inside. This left terrified students and teachers, unaware that the shooter had already been neutralized by campus police, to use desks, chairs, and their own bodies to barricade the doors.
Salzman hopes her bill changes that.
“It requires public institutions to annually conduct security assessments. It will require institution to have locks on all instructional spaces and develop plans to address rooftop access,” she said.
Here’s are the other main provisions in HB 757:

Makes it a second-degree felony to fire a weapon within 1,000 feet of a school.
Expands the state’s guardian program to the university level, allowing vetted volunteers to concealed carry on campus.
Promotes the use of a mobile suspicious activity reporting tool, like FortifyFL, to quickly alert law enforcement to dangerous circumstances.
Requires a student’s threat assessment reports and psychological evaluations to be transferred from a K-12 school to their college or university upon enrollment.
Mandates schools create family reunification plans, active assailant response plans, and threat-management teams.
Requires schools to annually conduct security risk assessments.
Increases training for faculty and staff to identify and respond to mental health problems.
Further connects students with mental health services.

HB 757’s Senate companion still provides for campus carry, although it has yet to be scheduled for its first committee hearing. Its sponsor, Sen. Don Gaetz, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on whether he would mirror Salzman’s bill in the upper chamber.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7861-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 12:01:30.083877

(Andrew Roth | Michigan Advance)The sea is getting choppy for candidates coasting on the Republican side of Michigan’s gubernatorial primary race, with a familiar name — Perry Johnson — raising his sails and promising to spend big money fast.
Johnson announced Monday that he was joining the GOP hunt for the governor’s office, with a campaign staff made up of Republican power players, Trump associates and a war chest forged from his personal wealth. Notably, Johnson told Nolan Finley of The Detroit News that he plans to spend $9 million of his own money over the next 60 days.
The Republican businessman and self-avowed “quality guru” ran for governor in 2022 before being tossed off the ballot in a fake petition signature scandal and then an abortive presidential run in 2024.
Two political and public relations consultants who spoke to Michigan Advance for this story said that Johnson and his millions, if not a sure-fire winner, will undoubtedly inject some energy into the sleepy GOP primary race, and could sharpen the candidacy of U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township if he is indeed still the frontrunner come spring and summer.
Johnson’s inclusion may not undo the gains already made by James, but it could bring him back down to earth and force him to start campaigning more aggressively to protect his lead. James for several months now has been running more of a prevent defensive campaign scheme as his name ID elevated him to the head of the pack, but that is starting to change with Perry aiming to punch holes in his hull.

John James (R-Shelby Township) that supporters of Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt brought to Michigan Republican Party gubernatorial debate in Sparta, Mich.

That change was evident last week as an ad war, that more than likely was started by Johnson ahead of his announcement on Monday, forced James to swing back against accusations of disloyalty to President Donald Trump.
‘Trump loyalty’ ad war exposes a new vulnerability for John James in Michigan gubernatorial hunt

There are currently six other candidates in the Republican hunt aside from Johnson and James, including state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox and former House Speaker Tom Leonard, to name a few. Johnson’s entry may also force those candidates to start spending the limited cash they’ve banked up through 2025.
Jason Roe, a longtime Republican strategist and a former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party, told the Advance that some of those single-digit polling candidates need James to come down a bit if they, too, are going to rise up in the ranks. Johnson’s messaging on James could help to do that, and not just for the benefit of the Johnson campaign.
“We’re also getting into the time of the cycle where the other Republicans should start spending. Now, can they spend is another question,” Roe said. “It doesn’t look like Tom Leonard has enough resources to spend in a meaningful way. Nesbitt does, but he might want to husband those resources a little bit longer.”
Roe said that Cox has money, but like Johnson, it’s personal money.
“Is he really willing to spend his personal money?” Roe said. “I think he will spend $1 million to $2 million, but I don’t think anyone’s convinced he’ll spend much more than that. I don’t think he’s raised really enough to add to that in a meaningful way.”

Overall, the rope-a-dope strategy employed by James thus far might fall by the wayside with Johnson nipping at his heels.
John Selleck, chief strategist and CEO of the Harbor Strategic firm, said Johnson certainly has the marketing budget to make his case, but it remained unclear if he had a new product to sell.
“We’ve seen the product for sale before, twice, for governor and when he ran for president,” Sellek said. “It didn’t go anywhere. So, this is not a new breath of fresh air from the business community that we need to watch and say, ‘can this person catch fire?’”
Sellek also agreed that the sheer amount of money he’s promising to spend in a short period of time will ultimately test the spending discipline and planning the other GOP candidates have worked out prior to Johnson jumping. That was particularly true of the candidates who are not John James.

“Aric Nesbitt has done a respectable job fundraising, but still, last time I looked, is at around $2 million,” Sellek said. “When you normally run a statewide campaign, you have to start at election day and work your way backwards, and $2 million, while a really respectable amount of fundraising for him … that’s not enough to start now.”
Sellek noted that Leonard is trying to jump on the AI data center issue, which puts him in a different lane in terms of things he can fundraise off of, but none of the candidates were necessarily counting on being up against someone else who would try to make themselves the main alternative to James, much like Johnson is doing now.

“Perry Johnson is simultaneously going to boost his own name ID, and I know they would say they have nothing to do with it, but team Johnson is attacking John James at the same time,” Sellek said, referencing the ad war that started last week. “He’s going to make a real intense, rapid attempt to rise to second place and take a chunk out of John James.”
While Johnson might have money, one big question is whether he can get Trump’s endorsement. The Johnson team is reportedly staffed with former Trump campaign folks. He’s also getting strategy and campaign advice from Republican pot-stirrer and convention delegate guru John Yob, who has been close to the White House in Trump’s second term. Johnson told Finley and the News that Trump was aware that he was running and that he wouldn’t endorse him unless he could get his poll numbers up to 20% or above — a tall order in a race with several candidates and at least three who have clear shots to make the ballot.
Benson on cruise control with Gilchrist out, but Duggan is sharpening her iron
But Johnson’s arrival wasn’t the only storm affecting the waters of the gubernatorial race. 
Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist’s exit from the Democratic primary ultimately opened a wide lane for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to speed ahead, leaving just Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson as an opponent, one without much cash and a more difficult path to victory.
All of those changes were happening as independent candidate Mike Duggan continued to make waves in January as his own battle cruiser charted new territory up north.

— Mike Duggan (@mikeeduggan) January 24, 2026

Duggan was among candidates who attended a political confab and gubernatorial forum in Traverse City last week, where he was the surprising winner of an unscientific poll of attendees, which asked who among the candidates present might be best for the city and the region.
Sellek said that Benson would normally be feeling like she’s living the dream in the sense that her initial opponents never materialized and started backing off before the race really began. But like Johnson, the independent Duggan presents a serious challenge to the pool of voters she might expect to net in the general election. 
That’s not necessarily a bad thing for Benson in the long run.
“He’s already taken a large number of traditionally Democratic endorsements from her,” Sellek said, adding that the vice was tightened on any other Democratic hemorrhaging from Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel. “I often buy into the idea that competition sharpens the blade.”

In that way, Benson and James are now in similar boats, Roe said.
“If you’re a good candidate and you’re the leader, you have an opportunity to get out there and show people that you are, and go and earn it and own it,” Roe added. “I think it would be very hard for the Democratic Governors Association to start focusing on the threat that Duggan is to her with Garlin Gilchrist still in the race. Now, with Gilchrist moving over, this allows Benson and the DGA to draw a contrast with Duggan.”
Roe said there will undoubtedly be a real fight in Detroit between Duggan and Benson, but that’s why Duggan is outsourcing his Detroit comeback message to other parts of the state — much like Traverse City.
“Duggan is the best retail campaigner of any of the candidates in the field,” Roe said. “He can spend outside of Detroit for a good amount of time and risk losing a little bit of his vote share there in the short term, because I think he can get it back at a later time; whereas, Benson’s got to go in there and convince these people who already know Duggan.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_0673-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 12:01:30.083877

Michael Coffey of the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. Oct. 7, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission could be granted broader power to regulate patients, caregivers and health care practitioners than voters approved for it in 2024 under a new legislative bill.
Legislative Bill 1235, from the Legislature’s General Affairs Committee, would allow the commission to write regulations around the “Nebraska Medical Cannabis Patient Protection Act,” which 71% of voters approved in 2024. The law voters approved allows patients to possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with an in-state or out-of-state doctor’s recommendation.
Voters, with 67% approval, created the Medical Cannabis Commission with a second ballot measure in 2024 — the “Nebraska Medical Cannabis Regulation Act.” It gives the commission “exclusive” regulatory authority over licensed cannabis establishments.
State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue. Nov. 7, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, who is leading LB 1235 as committee chair and is carrying the bill on behalf of the commission, described the proposal as providing additional regulatory “structure” for the commission. Of the additional powers being proposed, he said he’s “not real familiar.”
“But, apparently, that’s a good thing to have, I mean, as a commission,” he said. “I’m not sure why that was left out of the referendum, but that’s about really all I know about that part of it.”
Holdcroft’s four fellow Republican committee members in the officially nonpartisan Legislature cosponsored the bill, allowing it to come from the committee rather than one senator. The committee’s three Democratic members did not sign on. The bill would need five votes to advance from committee.

Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, which led the 2024 ballot measures, disagrees with Holdcroft’s approach. She said the bill is “extremely concerning” and would strip protections from patients who legally possess medical cannabis and consolidate power in a governor-appointed commission that advocates have pushed back against for months.
“This bill forces us to face reality that our own children and most others will have protections ripped away from them,” said Eggers, a mother who seeks access to medical cannabis for her 11-year-old son, Colton, who has epilepsy and severe seizures.
“Although there are some provisions of this bill that we would support, we do not believe this is a good-faith effort,” Eggers continued. “Currently, as written, we will seek to see it fail.”
‘Failing patients’
The commission has leaned toward a small, tightly regulated program. Regulators have so far gone through multiple rounds of temporary regulations.
Under the latest version of commission regulations, dispensaries could not sell smokes, vapes, most edibles and products with high tetrahydrocannabinol concentrations. Cultivators could only have so many flowering plants at once. 
Physicians would need to sign up for the commission’s program and complete additional education to stay in. Patients would only be able to access commission-licensed dispensaries through one of these licensed in-state physicians.

Under LB 1235, patients and caregivers, as well as physicians, would need to pay an application fee and follow the commission rules if they want to legally possess medical cannabis in Nebraska at all. Nebraskans who turned to other states for the medicine in the meantime would legally be left behind.
The Holdcroft-led bill, by giving power over the Patient Protection Act, also could lead to more restrictions, such as limiting availability to people with qualifying conditions alluded to but not listed in LB 1235.
Eggers said families and advocates fought for patient and caregiver protections. Advocates have continued to push for similar protections for physicians because many patients have said that few, if any, Nebraska physicians have recommended cannabis since the laws took effect in December 2024.
Eggers pointed to those challenges and said the commission has been “failing patients and bowing to the political pressures from our governor and attorney general.”
Medicinal vs. recreational
The commission is still in the process of writing regulations. Three cultivator licenses have been issued, but regulators are still setting up a seed-to-sale tracking system before growing begins. Such a system would be provided under law and possibly funded via LB 1235.
The state is still likely months away from licensing dispensaries and hosting its first legal sales. Without the commission’s licensing system, cannabis can’t legally be purchased in the state.
LB 1235 would help the commission’s regulatory mission by allowing it to collect fees and fines. A funding mechanism has been an important component for Eggers, Holdcroft and other lawmakers.

Under LB 1235, medical cannabis could also be subject to sales taxes, at a statewide rate of 5.5 cents per $1. The proceeds would go to property tax relief. 
The bill would also give the commission regulatory power over testing facilities for cannabis products. Regulators could hire a dedicated executive director, at a salary set by commissioners, and commissioners would be paid $12,500 each year, plus reimbursements for commission-related expenses.
Of the public’s concerns over the current commission, Holdcroft said the regulatory commission is what voters put in place.
Lawmakers declined to support an advocate-backed bill in 2025 seeking additional regulatory guardrails. Some senators hesitated, they said, in part to give the commission time to act first.
“I think the people voted for medical cannabis,” Holdcroft said. “I think most of the voices you’re hearing would like to see it transition more into a recreational piece.”
Eggers and other advocates say they aren’t pushing for recreational marijuana and that, under the committee bill, patients seeking medicine would be left behind. Supporters and opponents have both acknowledged that the gridlock might accelerate efforts to legalize recreational marijuana.
‘Respectful of the voters’
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, committee vice chair, is one of the three Democrats on the General Affairs Committee who did not sign on to LB 1235.
He said the bill would grant discretion and authority to a commission that “has already demonstrated that it is openly hostile to the will of the voters.”

Cavanaugh said successful regulations would make medical providers feel safe in exercising their judgment, not feeling like writing recommendations would put them at risk. He added that voters created the commission as a “necessity” for a well-regulated industry.
“A successful program is respectful of the voters but, more importantly, respectful of the patients and the families of those patients who just want help,” Cavanaugh said.
Cavanaugh’s frustrations similarly led him to introduce LB 933, to explicitly give physicians protections, and LB 934, to make seats on the cannabis board elected. The election bill is also up for a public hearing Monday in Holdcroft’s committee.
Next week’s committee hearing will be at the same time the Medical Cannabis Commission meets. Asked about the scheduling overlap, Holdcroft said, “I don’t know. I don’t follow that.”
Physician protections
Holdcroft said he views the distinction between a “medicinal” and “recreational” program as the doctor-patient relationship. He said allowing the purchase of 5 ounces of raw cannabis flower, which he said could make 400 smokable joints, isn’t medicine. 
Raw flower was a point of contention last year, and the 2026 bill would strike language saying “medical cannabis accessories” include equipment to smoke, vape, inhale or otherwise ingest cannabis.
“I don’t think that we ever envisioned smoking medicine,” Holdcroft said.
Holdcroft said he wanted the bill to preserve the ballot language around medical cannabis equipment and accessories. He said the proposed changes around smoking, vaping, inhaling and ingesting medical cannabis were inadvertently left in and that he would be bringing an amendment to change that.

State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney, who joined Holdcroft and the three Democrats on the committee to advance the 2025 bill from committee, before it failed 23-22, said he’s talked with physicians who say well-regulated, prescribed cannabis can be helpful. He said lawmakers need to be thoughtful and careful but should move forward.
He said giving the commission authority over qualifying conditions is “key” to the program’s success and that physicians need to have the opportunity to prescribe “as they see fit, not as we direct them to … if they believe that it helps.”
“They should not be refrained from doing that based on the risk of prosecution,” Clouse said.
‘The law of the land’
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, another Republican committee member, led opposition to the advocate-backed bill in 2025 for additional regulatory structure. His opposition was also because of a pending Nebraska Supreme Court case over whether the ballot measures were properly on the 2024 ballot. A district court judge said they were, but the attorney general, secretary of state and a former state senator appealed the decision.
The case was argued in December and could be decided at any time.

Storm said adding a funding mechanism was a positive, “but I don’t want to see the bill get hijacked and have a bunch of stuff attached to it.”
Funding for the commission has also been contemplated in the state’s budget bills from Pillen, LB 1071 and LB 1072. Pillen’s budget proposal sets aside $1.75 million for the Medical Cannabis Commission through mid-2027.
Storm said he had no thoughts on the proposed expansion of the commission’s regulatory power. He said the bill was probably a little broader than it needed to be, at 28 pages but that the committee wanted a “placeholder” before the Feb. 2 hearing. 
“If the Supreme Court rules it’s all valid, and we have medical cannabis in Nebraska, then that’s the law of the land,” Storm said. “But I want to see it stay medicine.”

Jeff Landry and state lawmakers voted to lengthen dozens of prison sentences for criminal convictions, the governor’s staff says state incarceration expenses are surging.","Two years after Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers voted to lengthen dozens of prison sentences for criminal convictions, the governor’s staff says state incarceration expenses are surging.Two years after Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers voted to lengthen dozens of prison sentences for criminal convictions, the governor’s staff says state incarceration expenses are surging.

Landry’s team presented a budget proposal Friday that includes an $82 million year-over-year increase in state funding for its corrections system, which pays for nine prisons as well as the parole and probation system. State spending on Louisiana State Penitentiary, the maximum security prison in Angola, would go up at least $17.5 million alone, according to Landry’s budget presentation. 

The change equates to an 11% hike from current state funding in the corrections budget and would bring yearly state general funding spent on those services from $716.5 million to $798.2 million starting July 1.
Gary Wescott, secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, said some of the increase can be attributed to lengthier prison sentences Landry and the Louisiana Legislature have imposed.

At the beginning of his term in 2024, the governor called a special session for lawmakers to enact tough-on-crime legislation aimed at making sure people with criminal convictions are imprisoned longer. One measure more than doubled the minimum amount of time people were required to stay incarcerated from 35% to 85% of their full prison sentence. 

Another law change now prohibits people from having their prison stay reduced for the time they spend sitting in jail before they are convicted or plead guilty. Additionally, Landry and lawmakers abolished almost all access to parole and the number of people being released via parole has dropped to its lowest level in 20 years, according to ProPublica. 

Critics of these lengthier sentences expected them to increase the state’s prison population, which appears to be happening. Since Landry has taken office, the number of state inmates in Louisiana has grown by approximately 2,000 people to 31,100 overall, according to statistics on the corrections department’s website. 

Angola’s prison population alone has gone up 426 people since 2024, according to the prison system. It now stands at 4,258, not including those being held in the federal immigration detention camp opened on the prison’s grounds last year. 

The $17.5 million increase Landry has proposed for Angola’s budget next year includes a planned expansion separate from the immigration detainee camp. The governor wants to put 680 more state inmates on the sprawling 18,000-acre campus following the rehabilitation of older buildings on the grounds. The extra prisoners will require Angola to hire 150 more staff members.
In an interview, Wescott said many of the 680 additional people at Angola are expected to already be part of the state inmate population. They would normally be held as state prisoners in local jails, but those facilities are becoming overcrowded following Landry’s sentencing changes. Sheriffs are asking for state inmates to be moved from parish lockups into state facilities because they lack space to house them, Wescott said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The prison system has struggled with short staffing at Angola for several years. Its remote location in West Feliciana Parish — the prison entrance is at the end of a 20-mile rural road — makes it difficult to recruit employees to work there. 

Wescott said he has asked lawmakers to back a law change during their upcoming spring session that would make it easier for him to rehire retired correctional officers without them having to forfeit retirement benefits. The change should make it easier to staff up at the prison, he said. 
Wescott also plans to push for a pay raise for corrections officers, which he said should attract more job applicants. 
Beyond Angola, Wescott said much of the $82 million increase in proposed prison spending is needed to cover rising medical costs. Incarcerated people don’t qualify for federal health insurance through Medicaid or Medicare, so state funding must cover all of their medical bills. This includes very expensive treatments for illnesses such as cancer. 
Wescott said he is trying to keep health costs down by using medical furloughs for terminally ill prisoners. The corrections secretary can release inmates who are expected to die within 90 days. Once on the outside, they qualify for Medicaid or Medicare, and the prison system is no longer responsible for their medical bills. Most of the expenses shift to the federal government. 
Wescott said he plans to support legislation that would expand the period in which a state prisoner could qualify for a medical furlough from three to six months at the end of their life. This could help the state cut down on health care expenses, he said. 
But the larger the prison population is — and the older incarcerated people get as they remain behind bars for longer periods of time — the more likely the state is to spend more on prisoner health care, according to critics of Landry’s sentencing changes. 
Former Gretna state Rep. Joe Marino, who chaired the Louisiana House Committee on Criminal Justice, spoke out against Landry’s longer prison sentences when the legislature debated them in 2024. 

The cost will only continue to go up as more people are sentenced under the new, tougher guidelines, Marino said. The longer sentences went into effect in August 2024, meaning that, for now, most people in Louisiana prisons are still serving time under the older, more lenient system.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 

“It’s only just begun. You are going to be spending more money on incarcerating people every year going forward,” Marino said in an interview Monday. “I would suggest that this increase is the tip of the iceberg that is coming.” 
In 2024, the Legislature agreed to Landry’s tough-on-crime laws without knowing the overall costs of the changes. Lawmakers approved the bills before the legislature’s own staff could complete analyses about their associated expenses. 
At the time, legislators who backed the changes said the costs of the sentencing changes were irrelevant because the public wanted harsher consequences for criminals no matter the cost.

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte announced Tuesday that she would nominate Christopher Ellms Jr., the current deputy commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Energy, for the role of chairman of the Public Utilities Commission.
“Electric bills in New Hampshire are too high, and our Public Utilities Commission needs leadership that prioritizes lowering costs for families,” she said in a press release. 
Christopher Ellms
Energy costs in New Hampshire are among the highest in the nation. The Public Utilities Commission is a court-like entity that regulates utilities in New Hampshire, hearing cases and issuing orders related to utility expenditures and rate changes.
Ellms holds a bachelor’s degree in Political Science from Northeastern University and previously worked for Chris Sununu, first as director of operations for Sununu’s gubernatorial campaign and later working for Sununu during his term as governor. Ellms held titles including policy adviser for the Office of Governor Chris Sununu and energy adviser at the Office of Strategic Initiatives. 
Preceding his appointment to the Department of Energy, he served as legislative director for Sununu for nearly three years, according to Ellms’ LinkedIn.
Ellms has held the role of deputy commissioner of the Department of Energy since the department was created in 2021 under Sununu. The department was proposed as a dedicated home for state energy policy and innovation, though critics worried at the time its creation would erode the independent authority of the three-person Public Utilities Commission. Since the founding of the Department of Energy, some confusion and disagreements have endured over the respective roles of the two entities.
The role of chairman at the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission has been vacant since Ayotte announced she would not reappoint then-Chairman Daniel Goldner in September. 
Commissioner Mark Dell’Orfano, a lawyer and former New Hampshire assistant attorney general, has served as interim chair. Also sitting on the Public Utilities Commission is Pradip Chattopadhyay, an economist with two decades of experience in energy policy.

The Board of Trustees of the Vermont Journalism Trust today announced that Sky Barsch has decided to step down as Chief Executive Officer of VTDigger, effective June 1, 2026. Sky will continue to serve as CEO until then, working closely with the Board and leadership team to advance the organization’s priorities and support a strong, thoughtful transition. 
Sky joined VTDigger in 2023 at a pivotal moment, following the departure of founder Anne Galloway and a period of interim leadership. She stepped into the role with clarity of purpose and a deep respect for VTDigger’s mission, helping guide the organization from its founder-led chapter into its next era as a lasting civic institution for Vermont.
Under Sky’s leadership, VTDigger strengthened its financial foundation, expanded and deepened readership and donor support across the state and reaffirmed its commitment to providing rigorous, independent journalism as a public good — available to all without a paywall. Just as importantly, Sky helped articulate a vision of VTDigger that is larger than any one person: a news organization built to serve Vermonters for generations.
“It’s been an honor to lead VTDigger and to serve Vermonters alongside such a talented staff and dedicated board,” Barsch said. “I’m incredibly proud of the journalism we’ve produced and the trust we’ve built with communities across the state. VTDigger is strong, mission-driven, and well positioned for the future — and I’m excited to support the organization as it takes its next steps.”
As VTDigger looks ahead, it does so from a position of strength — guided by what Vermonters have told us they want and need from a statewide news organization. Communities across the state have called for more diverse voices, deeper reporting from rural regions beyond the Montpelier to Burlington corridor, and journalism that reflects complexity by including multiple perspectives. They have also emphasized the value of reporting that helps people understand issues and participate before decisions are made. 
Listening to Vermonters has sharpened VTDigger’s direction and clarified the opportunity to deliver even more world-class journalism that helps people understand their communities and their government, keeps Vermont informed and prepared for what lies ahead, and connects Vermonters to one another — and to the wider world — with clarity, context and care.
Gaye Symington, President of the Vermont Journalism Trust, said, “Sky was exactly the leader VTDigger needed at this moment in its history. She brought steadiness, vision, compassion, fiscal discipline and an unwavering belief in the importance of local journalism. Because of her leadership, VTDigger is poised to meet its future with confidence and ambition.”
The Board of Trustees has launched a search for VTDigger’s next Chief Executive Officer, seeking a leader who will build on this strong foundation and guide the organization through its next chapter of growth and impact. Inquiries may be directed to 2026CEOSearch@vtdigger.org. 
VTDigger is Vermont’s statewide digital news organization, informing and connecting Vermonters through fact-checked, original reporting that strengthens democracy and civic life. It is a project of the Vermont Journalism Trust.

Jeff Landry addresses the Louisiana Legislature on opening day of legislative session, Monday, April 14, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate Pool)With his latest budget proposal, Gov. Jeff Landry is restarting what appears likely to be an annual debate of whether and how to expand Louisiana’s education voucher program.
Again, he’s hitting resistance.
The governor’s $46.9 billion spending plan, released to lawmakers Friday, would keep most state programs and services operating at their current levels – with some notable exceptions.
Landry seeks to grow staff for and spending on the state adult and youth prison systems, to add more money for economic development efforts and to double the money allocated to the new voucher program that lawmakers created in 2024, called LA GATOR.
At the initial hearing outlining the budget proposal, only the LA GATOR money saw pushback, previewing a return to the debate that stalled a similar growth proposal last year.
The multibillion-dollar spending plan for the 2026-27 budget year that begins July 1 shows the first significant costs for Louisiana’s treasury from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the massive federal tax and spending bill passed last year by Congress.
While the upcoming budget year offers few financial difficulties for the governor and lawmakers, unpredictability continues for the future amid national economic headwinds, planned federal spending cuts and state tax changes that continue to roll out in phases.
As always, the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana recommends the administration and Legislature use caution when growing expenses or creating new programs. Such an approach is even more urgent as the potential state costs tied to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are expected to increase in the future while the flexible state general fund dollars available to lawmakers are forecast to decline at the same time.
The Republican governor’s budget recommendations would shrink spending from $50 billion in the current year.
The $3 billion decline is largely tied to the disappearance of one-time state dollars that lawmakers removed from a savings account to spend on infrastructure projects, maintenance work, debt payments and other earmarks. In addition, some federal dollars are disappearing from the budget.

Education spending
Once again, Landry’s push to increase spending on the education voucher program appears likely to become the most contentious part of the budget debate. He’s proposing to add another $44 million to LA GATOR, doubling its cost to nearly $88 million.
The education savings account program allows parents to use state tax dollars to pay for private school tuition, homeschool materials and other education expenses outside of the public school system.
The governor sought similar funding levels for the program last year, but lawmakers only agreed to shift $44 million from a prior voucher program that paid for students to attend private schools.
About 5,700 students are receiving assistance through the LA GATOR program, according to data from the Louisiana Department of Education, and about 90% of those students were in the prior voucher program that has since been eliminated.
Legislative leaders, particularly in the Senate, have raised concerns about the ability to afford rapid program expansion, the guidelines for how parents can use the money and the possibility they’d be paying for children who already were attending private schools.
Meanwhile, Landry did not include nearly $200 million that lawmakers have allocated for the last three years to give $2,000 stipends to public school teachers and $1,000 stipends to school support workers. Instead, the administration is hoping voters in May will approve a constitutional amendment that would dissolve three education trust funds, use the money to pay down retirement debt and funnel the savings into K-12 public school pay.

The TOPS college tuition program would be fully funded at $286 million to cover all eligible students, including those high-performing students who are receiving the new Excellence Award level lawmakers created last year.
The budget plan would add $14.5 million to the M.J. Foster Promise Program, boosting annual funding to $25 million for the financial aid initiative that helps students earn credentials at community and technical colleges for high-demand, high-wage jobs.
Other spending increases
Landry’s spending plan seeks sizable increases for the Department of Corrections and the Office of Juvenile Justice and 300 new jobs across the two agencies. Costs are rising in part because the governor urged lawmakers to pass a series of tough-on-crime laws that increased the length of sentences and enacted harsher penalties for certain criminal activity.
The budget would add $28 million in state funding for the Office of Juvenile Justice, including money to fully operate the Jetson Center for Youth in Baker that is scheduled to open in April and money to add a new youth lockup facility through a lease with the Vernon Parish Sheriff’s Office.
The Department of Corrections would receive an $82 million state funding hike, with multimillion-dollar increases across nearly all adult prisons, including a more than $17 million boost so the Louisiana State Penitentiary can house more inmates.

New dollars would be spent on nursing homes that care for Medicaid patients, improvements to the computer system in the child welfare department and new equipment and vehicles for the Louisiana State Police.
Temporary pay stipends that judges received over the last two years would become permanent, and the judicial system would get more money to pay for them.
The economic development department would receive $75 million for its new High Impact Jobs Program, to provide grants to companies that create jobs paying above the parish average wage. The grant program replaces other tax incentives that were eliminated.
The budget proposal also includes a $42 million increase in state spending to administer the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly known as the food stamp program.
Under the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, states will have to pay 75% of the administrative costs for SNAP beginning Oct. 1, while the federal government will pay 25%. Previously, the costs had been split evenly between the state and federal governments.
The Louisiana Department of Health must begin enacting federally mandated work requirements for some Medicaid recipients in the upcoming budget year, but the agency said it would absorb the software, staffing and other related costs.
What’s next
The Landry administration didn’t offer detailed ideas for spending a $577 million surplus left over from the prior fiscal year, beyond the required $144 million deposit in Louisiana’s “rainy day” fund and the required $144 million payment of retirement debt. Lawmakers also have an extra $292 million in unspent cash from the current budget year available.
The presentation of the governor’s proposal to the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget kicks off months of negotiation before lawmakers complete the final package of spending bills. The regular legislative session begins March 9 and must end in early June.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Legislature-open-551-1024x573.jpg,,,2026-01-27 11:12:22.203393

Bob Lewis proposed an amendment to House Bill 2426 that would make multi-occupancy bathrooms in government buildings only available to people based on their biological sex at birth. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The anti-transgender “bathroom bill” made a comeback in Kansas politics Monday after a GOP-led legislative committee pushed out legislation to force anyone using a bathroom in government buildings to use the facility matching their biological sex at birth. 
In an often antagonistic hearing, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to expand the focus of House Bill 2426, which would require Kansans to use their biological sex at birth on their driver’s licenses. The original bill received opponent feedback from more than 200 people. 
Rep. Bob Lewis, a Garden City Republican, offered the bathroom amendment shortly after the committee began working HB 2426, drawing ire from committee Democrats. There was no public notice that the committee would take action on the bill, and no public notice that the bathroom restriction would be added to it.
“We all thought that this bill was probably a bathroom bill, and now it’s showing its true colors,” said Rep. John Carmichael, D-Wichita. “What this bill is about, with this amendment, is making it so that people who are transgender or people who are intersex have no safe place to go to the bathroom.”
Lewis said no one would be denied access to a bathroom but would have to use the bathroom that matched their biological sex at birth. 
The amendment would require Kansas government buildings to designate multi-occupancy private spaces, such as bathrooms, locker rooms and shower rooms, as either male or female, Lewis said. Users would have to visit the facility that matched their biological sex at birth. 
Spaces that are single occupancy, such as family restrooms, could still be unisex, he said. The bill also set exceptions for when a person of the opposite sex could enter a bathroom to include complying with the Americans with Disability Act, rendering medical attention, and as necessary for law enforcement and for coaching, Lewis said. 
The bill outlines enforcement, including if a public building fails to maintain the spaces for male or female, he said. If an individual uses a bathroom not tied to their biological sex at birth, the first violation will result in a written notice from the governing body, which could be challenged at an administrative hearing. The second violation could be a $1,000 penalty, and the third would be a misdemeanor crime, Lewis said. 
An individual who is in the space that a person of the opposite sex enters also could bring a private action in court, which could result in paying attorneys fees and damages, he said. 
Carmichael, Rep. Lindsay Vaughn, D-Overland Park, and Rep. Dan Osman, D-Overland Park, objected to the introduction of the amendment that changed the bill significantly. Vaughn challenged whether it was germane to the original bill, saying that they were talking about driver’s licenses and then discussing “policing public spaces.” 
Rep. Susan Humphries, R-Wichita, the bill’s sponsor and committee chair, said she knew the issue would come up. She decided it was germane.  
When Vaughn pushed to understand her reasoning, Humphries said, “I’m not going to go into detail other than —”
“It’s about discriminating against trans people,” Vaughn said. 
“No, it’s about sex, the definition of gender and sex,” Humphries said. 
Once the amendment passed with the committee’s Republican majority voting in favor, Humphries made a motion for a “gut and go,” placing the contents of HB 2426 into Senate Bill 244, which was about compensated surety when passed by the Senate. 
Osman questioned what the gut-and-go would mean for the bill process, and a legislative staffer said the Senate would not have to have a hearing on the bathroom bill. 
“This is an attempt to obfuscate what we’re doing here,” Carmichael said. “If you’re in favor of a lack of transparency, if you’re in favor of taking bill numbers and playing them like a shell game, this is the amendment for you.” 
Carmichael referred to Attorney General Kris Kobach’s attempt to enforce a previous bill that stopped gender marker changes on driver’s licenses. 
Although the 90-minute hearing was running late, he read through what the court thought of the previous attempt by the Legislature to change gender markers, ending by criticizing the rushed process taken by the Judiciary Committee to combine and pass the bill. 
The result, he said, puts a sign in the state of Kansas that says “transgender persons, intersex people, there’s no public place for you to pee, that you’re not welcome in Kansas, that as far as your community is concerned, Kansas had better be a flyover state because you’re not welcome here.”
Humphries reiterated that the bill is about safety. 
“I think this bill that we’re going to vote on has to do with legislative intent. I think it has to do with truth, accuracy. I think it has to do with public safety,” she said. “I think it has to do with the vast majority of people in Kansas. And I appreciate all of the discussion. I know we have different opinions on harm.”
Humphries provided no evidence of safety issues. 
Vaughn said no evidence of harm has been shown in various court proceedings, although the state has been changing gender markers on driver’s licenses for 16 years. 
However, she said Humphries’ bill endangers transgender people. 
“You say that they can use the restroom, but they are being intimidated in public spaces by this bill to not use the restroom that aligns with their gender and presentation,” she said. “You’re turning everyday Kansans into the gender police, and making it harder for people who already experience some of the greatest rates of violence in our community.”
The full House and Senate would need to vote on SB 244, and override a potential veto from Kelly with two-thirds majorities in both chambers, before it can become law.
In 2023, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 180, called the “women’s bill of rights,” that defined women by their biological sex at birth, which Kobach used to try to stop gender marker changes on driver’s licenses and birth certificates. The bill also allowed transgender people to be barred from bathrooms. 
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly at the time ordered the state to continue to change gender markers on driver’s licenses and birth certificates, which resulted in Kobach filing a lawsuit. The Kansas Court of Appeals in 2025 said Kobach had not shown that harm occurred from changing gender markers and overturned an initial finding in Kobach’s favor from a lower court.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Lewis-20260113_160444-1024x703.jpg,,,2026-01-27 11:12:22.203393

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)In the midst of fatal shootings by federal agents of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, a Democratic state senator from Missoula is proposing legislation to limit the way law enforcement officers operate in Montana.
Republican lawmakers are skeptical such legislation will gain traction.
Sen. Ellie Boldman, D-Missoula, said a trio of bills she plans to present would require law enforcement, including federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, to clearly display identification while on the job; limit mask wearing during operations; and protect “privileged places,” such as churches, hospitals, schools and daycares.
Boldman said the bills are aimed at restoring transparency, accountability and constitutional protections in federal enforcement actions. She said they are not about immigration nor are they radical.
“They are about whether armed federal agents should be allowed to operate in secret, without accountability, and in the same neighborhoods where Montanans live, worship, learn and seek medical care,” Boldman said in a statement.“Many of our state and local law enforcement officers already follow these guidelines as common-sense rules that promote public trust. It’s time that those who don’t are held to the same standard.”
Montana’s next legislative session doesn’t start until January 2027, and in an interview, Boldman said she plans to use the months ahead to talk with Montanans about the idea.
She believes it will gain support from faith based groups, Montana law enforcement officers, and more libertarian leaning legislators.
State Sen. Susan Webber, a fellow Democrat and member of the American Indian Caucus, said Native American constituents in particular are concerned about the potential presence of federal agents in Montana this spring as powwow season starts.
Native Americans have been harassed, questioned and detained by federal agents in Minneapolis, New Mexico, Arizona, and elsewhere, according to Source NM and the AZ Mirror, also States Newsroom outlets, and The Red Nation Podcast.
“It’s getting closer to us,” Webber said.
However, other Republican legislators, including Sen. Barry Usher, a former law enforcement officer who has served as chairperson of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he’s skeptical the state could enforce such legislation on federal authorities.
Usher also said Montanans are largely supportive of law enforcement officers, and the restrictions are unnecessary.
“I think it’s premature, and she’s trying to put out a political statement, which is not needed in the state of Montana,” Usher said of Boldman.
Republican President Donald Trump has focused on mass deportation of illegal immigrants in his second term.
However, federal officers have detained U.S. citizens and other people who are legally in the country as part of their sweeps, and in Minneapolis, immigration officers fatally shot two U.S. citizens this month, including nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday.
The deaths have led to national outcry.
A recent poll from Politico shows most Americans, 55%, support the deployment of ICE agents around the country, but a growing number of people are dissatisfied with how Trump is implementing his deportation agenda.
Boldman said the Jan. 7 shooting death of mother and poet Renee Good at the hands of a federal officer in Minneapolis prompted her to propose restrictions on federal law enforcement action in Montana.
Boldman said her interest is not in immigration.
Rather, as a lawyer, Boldman said she is concerned with protecting people’s civil liberties and ensuring law enforcement operates with accountability and not under anonymity.
She said she also recalls times when people on the more conservative end of the political spectrum introduced bills to “get the feds out of our communities,” such as in the aftermath of the Ruby Ridge standoff in 1992.
In that northern Idaho incident, the firefight and standoff between federal agents and family members of a man charged with selling a couple of illegal sawed-off shotguns to an undercover agent left two unarmed people dead, along with a U.S. marshal and a dog. It resulted in criticism of federal law enforcement.
Boldman said the proposed legislation isn’t meant to stop lawful enforcement activity in Montana. However, she said federal authorities don’t have “unchecked authority” in Montana, and the state can place guardrails around their activity.
“I’ve heard from a helluva lot of police officers from our communities that serve and work and live in our communities that do not support what is happening in Minneapolis,” Boldman said.
While Boldman said she anticipates some Republican co-sponsors, Usher won’t be among them.
He said he believes Montana doesn’t have the problems Boldman is attempting to address, and ICE is operating without issues in states besides Minnesota.
He said people understand the work of ICE agents “gets a bad guy out of our hair,” and it means Montanans don’t foot the bill for their detention here.
“We don’t need them raping and killing our people,” Usher said.
Citing multiple national studies, the Migration Policy Institute said immigrants of all legal statuses commit crimes at lower rates than people born in the United States. The institute describes itself as a nonpartisan think tank focused on immigration.
Rep. Neil Duram, also a Republican in law enforcement, said he would resist such legislation, although he said sometimes, people present bills that aren’t intended to become law anyway.
“Sometimes, people bring legislation not to pass, but to further the argument,” said Duram, of Eureka.
He also said if people are wrongly grabbed by ICE, such as if they are citizens who have a right to be in the U.S., they can make their case in court.
Webber, of Browning, said Native Americans in Montana are preparing to encounter ICE agents who assume a person who has dark skin is illegal. She said Native Americans make up just 6% of the population in the state and stand out in Montana.
“That’s always been an issue with us is the racial profiling,” Webber said.
Based on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, Webber also said people who didn’t worry about traveling to cities such as Missoula in the past have started to think twice about doing so.
Webber said there is fear of encountering ICE, but also there are the facts of the matter.
“You can’t send us anywhere,” Webber said. “This is our land. This is our homeland. We are the first Americans. So we are really having concerns about that.”



Montana legislators to participate in ‘Day of Solidarity’ in Minnesota
As part of an initiative organized by Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, more than 100 legislators from 23 states and the District of Columbia will gather in person and virtually in Minnesota on Thursday to stand with their colleagues in the Minnesota Legislature, according to a news release.
The state legislators will show solidarity in confronting increasing federal overreach, the expanding presence of federal agents in American communities, and the escalation of violence in the wake of the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, said the news release from Neumann and Montana Senate Democrats.
In addition to Montana, the 108 state lawmakers from the following states will participate in the Day of Solidarity, either in person or virtually: Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Washington State, and Wisconsin; as well as the District of Columbia.
This trip follows Sen. Ellie Boldman filing bill requests for legislation that would improve transparency and accountability for federal immigration and law enforcement agencies operating in Montana.
In addition to Neumann and  Boldman, other Democratic legislators who will be attending Day of Action in person are the following:
Senate Minority Leader Pat Flowers (Bozeman)

It might be cold, but our hearts are warm.”
That was the sign I held at the Minneapolis-St.Paul airport years ago as a refugee family emerged at baggage claim. They walked toward us tired and smiling, strangers waving American flags and holding handmade signs, welcoming them to their new home in the United States. They arrived with children in arms, several suitcases, and jackets that would soon prove no match for a Minnesota winter.
Two weeks earlier, the resettlement agency had called on short notice and asked if our group could assist with this family’s resettlement. We cleaned a rundown apartment, gathered donated furniture, found car seats and coats, bought phones, and stocked the fridge. All in the hope that when they arrived, they would feel comfortable. 
That is what safety looks like in real life. 
And now it is at risk. 
In 1968, the United States ratified the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, committing the United States to a core legal protection known as non-refoulement. In plain terms, it prohibits returning refugees to persecution or torture. The United States later reinforced that obligation by ratifying the Convention Against Torture in 1994, which separately bars returning anyone to torture, regardless of immigration status.
That promise is not symbolic; it is codified in U.S. law. If a person has a well-founded fear of persecution or torture, the government is legally barred from returning them. The exceptions are narrow and require due process.
The treaty imposes additional obligations. People may not be punished solely for seeking safety, and detention is permitted only when necessary and subject to judicial review.
A treaty is only as strong as the system that enforces it. U.S. law and international human rights law agree on a basic point: The promise not to return someone to persecution or torture has meaning only if people are given a genuine opportunity to seek protection. That requires access to asylum screening, individualized hearings and a functional legal process.
Non-refoulement is therefore not merely a rule about outcomes. It is what’s known as a process-dependent obligation. When the immigration system is pushed so far beyond capacity that individuals cannot meaningfully present their claims for protection, the United States risks violating its legal commitments. That risk exists even without intent, and even before anyone is actually removed, when access to asylum or fair process is undermined.
Immigration enforcement is an executive function, but it is defined and limited by Congress. Congress defines the system, sets limits, and implements treaty obligations. For non-self-executing treaties like the Refugee Protocol, it is Congress, not the president that must give them legal effect. Without clear laws and oversight, treaty commitments risk being undermined by unilateral executive action. 
The risk is no longer theoretical; three executive actions are now compounding decades of immigration system dysfunction and placing the United States at risk of violating its treaty obligations.
First, the federal government is rapidly expanding large-scale immigration enforcement. 
In Minnesota, the Department of Homeland Security has deployed at least 3,000 federal immigration agents in what state and city officials describe in court filings as a sweeping operation. Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have sued DHS alleging constitutional violations, including excessive force, warrantless arrests, and racial profiling. 
The surge has coincided with the fatal shooting of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents, an autopsy-ruled homicide of a Cuban immigrant held by ICE in Texas, and documented abuse in overcrowded detention facilities. While these incidents differ in cause and context, they illustrate systemic stresses created by this administration’s immigration enforcement approach and raise questions regarding compliance with constitutional laws.
This is not an argument against immigration enforcement, but an argument against enforcement approaches that outpace due process and strain the very systems responsible for ensuring lawful removals. When enforcement overwhelms courts, attorneys, and detention capacity, the risk of refoulement rises sharply. That procedural failure is illustrated by the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador despite a standing court order barring his removal. It is also illustrated by the detention of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, asylum seekers with active pending cases who are protected under both international and federal law.
Second, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has begun reopening settled refugee cases at scale.
In November, USCIS announced a review of refugees admitted between 2021 and 2025. On Jan. 9, it launched an operation targeting already-vetted and resettled refugees for what it terms “intensive verification.”
The initial focus is on 5,600 people in Minnesota who remain in refugee status while awaiting green cards. Resettlement agencies report that refugee families, including children, have been detained, separated and transferred out of state without access to counsel.
At the same time, a new USCIS policy is effectively preventing refugees from adjusting to lawful permanent resident status, undermining the requirements of the 1967 Protocol. 
Under federal law, refugee determinations are made on a case-by-case basis and are considered settled unless the government proves fraud, material misrepresentation or a national security risk. The government must submit evidence and follow established legal procedures. To date, the administration has not pointed to any systemic failure in the refugee screening process, demonstrated patterns of fraud or any national security lapse that would justify reopening cases at this scale.

Courts have repeatedly held under administrative law that agencies must respect reliance interests and cannot reverse settled determinations without reasoned explanation, evidence and procedural safeguards. Large-scale reopenings of settled refugee cases are therefore legally vulnerable to challenge.
Third, the administration is moving to normalize denaturalization, the stripping of American citizenship. 
On June 11, 2025, the Department of Justice instructed its attorneys to “prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings,” authorizing pursuit of any case officials deem “sufficiently important” and, according to internal guidance, setting targets of up to 100-200 denaturalization cases per month, a scale without modern precedent.
Denaturalization is an extraordinary remedy. It can occur only through federal court and only after the government meets a very high evidentiary standard, a process that typically takes years. Treating it as routine fraud enforcement transforms the nature of citizenship itself.
For refugees and asylees who later naturalize, citizenship is intended to be the final safeguard against return to persecution. Once revoked, a person becomes deportable and subject to the United States’ non-refoulement obligations. Even where citizenship is revoked for fraud, that determination does not resolve the separate legal question of whether removal would expose a person to persecution or torture, which requires its own evidentiary showing and individualized assessment under U.S. law. By expanding the pool of people subject to removal without clarifying evidentiary standards or selection criteria, the administration is placing new pressure on the courts and potentially re-exposing individuals to the very harms citizenship is meant to prevent. 
The constitutional concern is not the existence of denaturalization authority, but its transformation from a rare remedy into a volume-driven enforcement tool.
Taken together, these actions reflect an executive branch pushing against judicial limits and setting the stage for a surge of constitutional challenges and denaturalization proceedings in federal court. At the same time, current executive enforcement approaches are overextending a federal immigration system carrying roughly 3.4 million immigration cases, a volume that strains due process and protective treaty compliance. When courts cannot hear claims in time, or access to counsel collapses under volume, non-refoulement is at serious risk of being violated in practice even if it remains intact on paper, a risk heightened as enforcement mechanisms grow more complex and removal pathways more indirect.
Congress exists to restrain executive power. Instead, it has underfunded immigration and federal courts through appropriations and largely abandoned its oversight role, leaving the judiciary to absorb the fallout of executive action under mounting capacity constraints. 
When the system falters, the consequences do not remain in Washington. Raids happen in neighborhoods. Detentions overwhelm county jails. Arrests unfold on city streets. Requiring governors, mayors, police chiefs, judges, and local leaders to manage the fallout from federal decisions they did not make and congressional inaction they did not choose.
Some of these actions have already resulted in documented violations of court orders, statutory protections, and constitutional limits. Others are placing the system under conditions where further violations are not speculative but structurally inevitable. 
The question now facing the country is simple: Will executive power remain bound by the Constitution, and will the United States honor its legal commitments at home and abroad? 
This question cannot be answered by the courts alone. It requires a Congress willing to reclaim its constitutional authority before executive power hardens into unchecked rule. The Constitution is not a backdrop. It’s an active constraint that requires maintenance. As James Madison warned, the accumulation of power in a single branch of government is the definition of tyranny.
For constituents, this isn’t abstract. Members of Congress decide how many immigration judges are hired; whether DHS is meaningfully overseen; and whether agencies can reopen settled refugee cases without clear statutory limits. When those guardrails fail, treaty protections fail with them. Voters should press their representatives to explain how a system Congress designed became incapable of carrying out the law Congress enacted.
That means demanding oversight hearings on Homeland Security enforcement practices, statutory limits on post-admission refugee case reopenings, clear protections against routine denaturalization, and appropriations sufficient to restore due process in the immigration system.
Minnesota once met refugees at the airport with flags and handmade signs. We met them with coats, stocked fridges, and open doors. We told them that even in the coldest winters, they would not be alone.
That is the Minnesota they came to, and the Minnesota I remember.
That same Minnesota stands in the cold today, patrolling school drop-off points to protect children, delivering food to neighbors, and standing between fear and families as federal agents sweep through residential streets.
Minnesota kept its word.

Derek Schmidt, R-Kansas, to express alarm at the second shooting death of a U.S. citizen by federal agents during President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. (Photo by Heather Diehl/Getty Images)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids and U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt of Kansas expressed various shades of alarm about fatal shootings of U.S. citizens by federal agents taking part in an aggressive immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.
The death Saturday of Alex Pretti, who worked as a nurse for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, followed the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good, which set off a wave of widespread protests.
“I am deeply troubled by the shootings in Minneapolis involving federal agents. Our constitution provides citizens protection from the government. We have a right to free speech, to peaceably assemble and to bear arms,” said Moran, a Republican who has served Kansans in Washington for three decades.
He said people in the United States expected government to thwart lawless behavior, including illegal immigration. He said that job required local, state and federal officials to work together on upholding the law.
“Law enforcement must reflect our nation’s values and citizens should obey the law,” said Moran, an attorney. “This tragic circumstance should be investigated to the fullest extent to ensure transparency and accountability.”
Davids, a Democrat representing the 3rd District of eastern Kansas, said she was “angry and heartbroken” by Pretti’s death. She said “this shouldn’t be who we are as a country” and urged the administration of President Donald Trump to halt the bloodshed.
“People should feel safe in their own communities, but right now families are afraid to leave their homes and communities are living in fear,” she said. “One killing is too many, but after two fatal shootings in recent weeks, this administration must answer for what happened and take immediate, concrete action to stop the senseless killing.”
Davids, also an attorney, said local law enforcement should be left to protect neighborhoods without the overbearing presence of “masked, militarized federal agents operating with zero transparency.”
 
Sustaining rule of law
Schmidt, the Kansas Republican serving his first term as 2nd District congressman, said U.S. immigration law had to be enforced in a manner respectful of constitutional boundaries. He said deadly shootings by federal officers in Minneapolis required rigorous investigation.
“In my view, there needs to be a transparent and thorough review and factfinding regarding the officer involved shootings in Minnesota — as there should be in every officer involved shooting anywhere,” said Schmidt, who served a dozen years as Kansas’ attorney general. “Enforcing the law professionally and with clear focus and common sense is vital to public confidence in the rule of law.”
Schmidt said reported actions by some federal officials and the alleged lack of cooperation among state officials was distressing. Difficulty enforcing U.S. immigration law was tied to decisions by President Joe Biden to allow millions of people into the country “illegally,” the congressman said.
Schmidt said Congress must fund body cameras and better training for personnel at U.S. Immigration and Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He said he would continue to raise questions about use by ICE or CBP of administrative, rather than judicial, warrants to enter homes.
Three Republicans in the Kansas congressional delegation — U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann and U.S. Rep. Ron Estes — didn’t respond to requests for comment about violence in Minnesota.
Christy Davis, a Democrat from Cottonwood Falls seeking to oust Marshall in 2026, said video images of federal agents confronting Pretti should challenge the government’s use of lethal force. She said the Trump administration had to be held accountable for unnecessary loss of life.
“If Senator Marshall is unwilling to call out the Trump administration for the use of militarized force against people in our communities, then he is failing in his duty as a U.S. senator,” Davis said. “The footage is horrifying and impossible to justify. This was not about public safety. It was unchecked violence carried out by a system that has abandoned accountability.”
 
‘Armed thugs’


Don Coover, a Democrat from Galesburg campaigning this year to challenge Schmidt in the 2nd District, said the federal crackdown ended up targeting people exercising constitutional rights of assembly and speech, protection from unreasonable search and seizure, the right to a fair and speedy trial, and the right to bear arms. He placed responsibility for failed leadership in Minneapolis with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE.
“As a West Point graduate and Army veteran, I am appalled at what we are seeing in our own country,” he said. “Apparently, ICE is now a band of out-of-control armed thugs that feel they are free to shoot American citizens that they violently disarm. The leaders of ICE and DHS feel free to make up stories unrelated to the facts that justify the execution of citizens they encounter in the streets.”
He asserted federal officials were acting “brazenly and openly” outside the law because Congress and the courts were “apparently afraid to fulfill their obligations.”
In the 4th District held by Estes, Democratic candidate Chris Carmichael said he was “deeply saddened and outraged” by the deaths of Pretti and Good. He said the U.S. Constitution couldn’t be abandoned simply because a federal agent chose to detain someone.
“We all know right from wrong and what is happening is simply wrong,” said Carmichael, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel. “What we are seeing from our current representatives right now would never be acceptable in the military. When lives are at stake, silence is not neutrality — it is failure.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2252436262.jpg,,,2026-01-27 11:12:22.203393

An unbudgeted $170,000 emergency command vehicle was purchased outside established protocols, using funds from the internal service fund meant for employee health insurance and risk management. During the same period, the town’s operating budget grew by 25%, contributing to two of the largest tax increases residents have faced in years.
That instability extends beyond spending. Tune into any Board of Finance meeting, and you’ll learn that in just two years, the Finance Department lost a CFO, a long-tenured controller, a budget director, multiple accountants, and grants administrators, resulting in missed audit deadlines for the first time in a generation and weakened internal controls. 
The Human Resources Department has experienced similar turnover, including the departures of the HR director, assistant director, benefits manager, and two administrative staff members. At the same time, a new payroll system intended to fix long-standing issues has instead produced costly payroll and tax-withholding errors and has been unable to migrate the police and fire departments to it.
The current police chief, appointed in July, still lacks a finalized contract. Taxpayers funded two fire chief positions for nearly a year because the fire chief was inexplicably sidelined and placed on paid administrative leave, which necessitated paying an interim chief. Key bargaining units still lack approved union contracts.
With residents facing a 6 to 8 percent property tax increase due to the recent property revaluation, there has been no public explanation of how the town plans to mitigate the tax burden in the upcoming budget. That silence should concern every taxpayer.
Please take the time to pay more attention to local government operations. We need more oversight. We need financial discipline. We need leadership and vision to result from the Feb. 3 election.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Household incomes have grown in nearly every state over the past 50 years, but a new study concludes that growth has been uneven across the country.
An analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data, released Tuesday from the Urban Institute’s Center for Local Finance and Growth, found inflation-adjusted incomes in Western, mid-Atlantic and New England states have grown the most since 1970, while incomes in Midwestern states have grown the least.
Between 1970 and 2023, Utah household incomes increased at a higher rate than any other state: The median income went up 78%, an increase of $40,820 in inflation-adjusted dollars to $93,421. Utah was followed by Colorado, New Hampshire, California, Arizona and Virginia, all of which saw more than 60% growth in median household incomes adjusted for inflation.
Nationally, median household incomes grew by an average of 32%.

The study found only one state saw inflation-adjusted incomes drop over the past five decades: West Virginia’s median household income fell by 0.4%, from $56,161 to $55,948 in inflation-adjusted dollars.
West Virginia had the second-lowest household income in the study, ranking ahead of only Mississippi’s $54,203. Massachusetts ranked the highest, with a median household income of $99,858.
The Urban Institute, a left-leaning think tank, found that rates of state sales and income taxes had no association with changes in median household income. The analysis also found states with colder temperatures and higher property taxes saw greater median income growth, despite popular notions that lower property taxes and warm temperatures can lead to more prosperity.
The factors most strongly associated with household income growth were educational attainment and increases in the percentage of immigrants in the state population, the study concluded.
“This could be because immigration leads to economic growth, immigrants seek out growing areas, or both,” the study said.

Paul Waggoner, R-Hutchinson, says his hometown school district crossed the line from education to advocacy for a failed bond issue last year. He is seen here during a Jan. 23, 2025, session of the House. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A lawmaker’s personal grievances took center stage in a hearing over his proposed legislation to scrutinize communication from public schools about bond issues.
Rep. Paul Waggoner, a Hutchinson Republican, said House Bill 2451 would strengthen existing law that prohibits public employees from electioneering while on the clock or with public resources. He said the Hutchinson school district’s communications last year on a failed bond issue blurred the distinction between educating the public, which is allowed, and advocating, which is unlawful.
The legislation clarifies that educators could be charged with a crime for crossing that line.
Critics of the bill said the real goal was to prevent administrators and teachers from saying anything about a proposed bond issue. They pointed to past clashes between Waggoner and school figures, his contributions to a campaign to defeat the bond issue, the fact that he doesn’t even live in the school district and couldn’t vote on the bond issue, and the double standard that he enjoys as a legislator to spend tax dollars on his partisan newsletters.
“I believe this bill’s sole purpose is to criminalize speech that Mr. Waggoner doesn’t like,” said Stacy Goss, who submitted testimony in her individual capacity rather than as the school district’s communications director.
 
Big, beautiful mailer
Hutchinson voters by a three-to-one margin rejected the school district’s $109.5 million plan to build a new middle school and support other projects. The district featured educational information, as vetted by an attorney, about the bond issue in place of a regularly planned newsletter.
Waggoner and Allison Reed, who volunteered for Waggoner’s legislative campaigns and defended him taking photos of a decorated teacher’s house in 2022, seized the opportunity to build resistance around the idea that the school was using taxpayer money to persuade the community to raise property taxes.
Waggoner testified in front of the House Elections Committee, for which he is also the vice-chair, and said it was “shocking” to see what he viewed as “standard campaign advocacy” in the school district’s communications. He said schools have a right to educate the public, but they are not supposed to advocate.
“I think that clearly is not followed at all in many ways. It’s just skirted,” he said.
Reed presented the committee with a PowerPoint presentation that showed, in her mind, how school materials closely resembled the messaging used by a campaign to support the bond issue. She denounced the eight-page, glossy “beautiful mailer” the school district had sent to residents.
“It doesn’t necessarily say ‘yes,’ but it certainly gives you an idea of where the person that produced this is coming from,” she said.
She noted that teachers wore buttons that said “I support Hutch kids” and included the same logo that was used as part of the advocacy campaign.
That would be the school logo.
Reed also complained that the school district unpublished a video of the school board meeting in December where administrators “admitted” they had spent $10,000 on the mailing and $4,000 on yard signs.
Goss, in response to Kansas Reflector questions, said the video in question no longer appears on the school district’s Facebook page because Facebook removes live videos after 30 days. However, Goss said, she would provide a copy of the video to anyone who emailed her. She provided a copy to the Reflector.
 
‘Troubling perception
In her written testimony for the committee, Goss said that while Waggoner’s bill is framed as a way to prevent misuse of public resources, it is overly broad and could silence “legitimate public education efforts.” The actual effect of the bill, she said, was to “chill lawful communications.”
“There is a troubling perception that this bill is being advanced by Rep. Waggoner, who has a personal agenda against Hutchinson Public Schools and individuals associated with our district,” she said.
She noted that Waggoner’s opponent in the 2024 election was a substitute teacher.
She said she refused to believe Waggoner’s intentions were “pure” because “he also has a personal agenda against me.” She said he opposed her campaign for city council by engaging in “ridiculous name-calling” on social media, including “tax-and-spend Stacy.” Waggoner doesn’t live in her council district, she said.
Hutchinson superintendent Dawn Johnson also provided written testimony in opposition to the bill. She said public schools have a responsibility to provide the public with accurate and timely information about bond issues.
But, Johnson said, Waggoner’s bill conflates education with advocacy and effectively would prohibit school districts from using websites, social media, email and other forms of communication to provide information about bond issues.
“This restriction would have a chilling effect on transparency and would leave voters less informed, not more protected,” Johnson said.
Other opponents called attention to the lack of clarity in the bill about when a public employee is allowed to speak about a ballot question.
Could a city manager go to a Rotary Club meeting on a Saturday and speak in favor of a proposed sales tax? If someone at a PTA meeting asks about a bond issue, is a teacher allowed to talk about it? There was no clear answer to those questions.
Anyone who runs afoul of the law could be convicted of a Class C misdemeanor and face up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
 
‘Fear of advocacy’
Waggoner wasn’t the only legislator with a personal grievance.
Sen. Doug Shane, R-Louisburg, told the House committee he had introduced a companion bill in the Senate in response to a school district in his area seeking support for a lease-purchase agreement. He said the school district advocated for support and that teachers even offered extra credit for students who produced advocacy materials.
“Community members were pretty aghast that the power and the influence of the school district would be used in that form and fashion, also creating a coercive environment within the school district itself, whether you’re a student or a staff member,” Shane said.
Rep. Brooklynne Mosley, D-Lawrence, questioned Shane about where he was getting his information.
“I’m sorry that you had to live in fear of advocacy,” Mosley said. “I’m sorry that that happened to you. You mentioned that you’re basically speaking for a whole community. Did you conduct any, like, surveys?”
Shane clarified that he wasn’t speaking on behalf of the community. Mosley asked how many people he had spoke with. Shane said it was “several dozen.”
Mosley asked if his children attended public school.
Shane: “So where my children attend school is not a prerequisite on this —”
Mosley: “Private school?”
Shane: “My kids are home schooled.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1232656b-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-27 09:57:34.771858

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A Kodiak man has been arrested and charged with a felony for allegedly impersonating an Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officer and harassing employees at the local Walmart and Safeway for “their papers.”
The incident comes amid a deployment of masked, un-uniformed federal agents nationwide as part of President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation campaign. That campaign has resulted in thousands of people being detained. People protesting the federal government’s actions have been killed and injured.
The Kodiak Daily Mirror first reported the charge facing Maximillian I. Kaplan, who was arrested Wednesday after a Walmart employee reported that a white man in his 30s, wearing black, “came into the store yelling at cashiers and customers for their papers, saying he was from ICE and that he almost got into a fight with someone outside,” according to an affidavit submitted to Kodiak District Court by Detective Jeffrey Valerio of the Kodiak Police Department.
Before police responded, they received another call from a manager at the nearby Safeway store, who said a similar looking man “came into the store and was very disruptive to customers.”
When police found Kaplan, he said that God told him to ask the employees for their papers.
Kaplan confirmed that he told the employees that he was with ICE and that he had asked them for their papers, Valerio wrote. When he asked Kaplan why he said he was with ICE, Kaplan replied, “because I am.”
Online court records show Kaplan is facing a charge of “impersonating a public servant,” a Class C felony, the lowest-level felony. In Alaska, that’s punishable by up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine. First-time offenders, particularly for nonviolent crimes, may receive probation and no jail time.  
In a preliminary hearing on Thursday, Assistant District Attorney Todd Shaker noted that the officer observed that Kaplan was wearing black with a backpack. 
“As we know, some ICE agent(s) aren’t uniformed,” Shaker said, according to the log notes of the hearing.
Kaplan asked to represent himself in court, and in a hearing on Monday, said he doesn’t trust the public defender’s office.
“I think this is all a political thing. They are setting me up to fail,” he said, according to log notes of the hearing. “I think it is because I am a tall white male. I think they hate me.”
Magistrate Judge Dawson Williams, presiding over the hearing, appointed a defense attorney from the Office of Public Advocacy to represent Kaplan.
“I wish it would work out here in this town, but I feel like this town is against me,” Kaplan said, according to the hearing’s log notes. “I’ve been kicked out of almost every store.”
A preliminary hearing in the case has been scheduled for Feb. 11.

Sierra Club takes unprecedented step to call for removal of House energy chair,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/energy/mass-sierra-club-takes-unprecedented-step-to-call-for-removal-of-house-energy-chair/,The move kicks the already-high tension around energy issues in Massachusetts up a notch and offers somewhat of a finer point on the political fallout from Cusack’s proposal last year.,"IF REP. MARK CUSACK’S effort to weaken Massachusetts’s ambitious 2030 climate commitments was the first shot across the bow in the contentious energy affordability debate, the nation’s largest environmental organization is making an unprecedented move to try to blunt his influence. 
The gamble from Cusack, a Braintree Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, prompted a backlash in November that knocked legislative leaders on their heels. Protesters filled the State House with signs reading, “Stop Rep. Cusack’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’” a reference to President Trump’s landmark law enacted last summer that featured sweeping cuts in federal support for health care and nutrition programs and clean energy initiatives.   
That blowback hasn’t left Beacon Hill.  
The Massachusetts chapter of the Sierra Club is set to call on House Speaker Ron Mariano to remove Cusack as chair of the powerful energy committee on Tuesday, citing his legislative efforts to use Gov. Maura Healey’s energy affordability legislation as a vehicle to pull back on the state’s clean energy targets and energy efficiency program.  
Cusack also hauled in about $2,400 in campaign contributions from energy interests right around the time his plan became public and cleared his committee. 
Leaders of Sierra Club’s Massachusetts chapter, which boasts 20,000 members, said those actions are enough to call for Cusack to step aside, the chapter’s first such move in its 56-year history. 
“At a time of increasingly severe temperature extremes, ballooning energy demands, and utility bill spikes, Massachusetts needs someone to lead the Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy committee who understands the essential role of clean energy and efficiency in saving ratepayers money each month — not someone who answers to the beck and call of fossil fuel interests scrambling to hold onto massive profits at our expense,” said Amelia Koch, vice chair of the Sierra Club Massachusetts Executive Committee, which unanimously voted for Cusack’s demotion. 
Evan MacKay, a member of the Massachusetts Sierra Club’s executive committee who recently launched a campaign to unseat a state lawmaker representing Cambridge, is expected to be one of the speakers at a Tuesday press conference to push for Cusack’s ouster, according to Vick Mohanka, director of the state’s Sierra Club chapter. 
Cusack didn’t respond to a request for comment, but Mariano harshly criticized the Sierra Club’s call for him to replace the energy committee chair. 
“With this foolish request, the Massachusetts Sierra Club is demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of the legislative process, and is simply overreacting to old news stories about an outdated committee redraft of the House’s energy affordability legislation,” Mariano said in a statement. “Just last week, [Ways and Means] Chairman Michlewitz and Chairman Cusack hosted several member meetings regarding this bill and are now working to incorporate the feedback that they received. For months now, the House has been clear that this legislation will not alter the state’s climate goals or retreat from our commitment to clean energy. Instead, our sole focus is on bringing down energy costs for residents, a goal that everyone should be capable of supporting.”  
Such a bold move from a progressive but mainstream environmental organization kicks the already-high tension around energy issues in Massachusetts up a notch and offers somewhat of a finer point on the political fallout from Cusack’s proposal last year. It comes as House members are debating how best to tackle soaring electric and heating costs, a pocketbook issue only bound to intensify as Healey seeks reelection, even with legislative leaders taking Cusack’s attempts to walk back the larger emission reduction commitments off the table for now. 
Still, Sierra Club’s decision to call for Cusack’s ouster comes with its own consequences, too — and has left some allies scratching their heads over the tactic. 
Two advocates at different environmental groups in Massachusetts, granted anonymity to express concern with the Sierra Club plan, told CommonWealth Beacon they are worried about the potential negative impact during a tenuous time in the legislative negotiations and questioned what such a move would achieve.  
While there’s little chance that Mariano would actually remove Cusack from his perch as chair of the committee, it could become harder for the Sierra Club and, by extension, other like-minded environmental groups to get meetings with lawmakers and be given access to influence the ongoing internal deliberations. 
Plus, these advocates argued that environmental groups are making inroads in shaping the measure to more closely align with their policy objectives after House leadership halted Cusack’s original version from quickly advancing. While there remains an appetite among lawmakers to cut or cap the Mass Save energy efficiency program, the bill could be moving back toward the center as it appears unlikely that language to dial back the climate goals will remain in the legislation as it makes its way to the full chamber for a floor vote. Sierra Club’s move, they worry, could undermine the progress the groups feel they are making. 
Not everyone agrees that Sierra Club’s move has drawbacks. Jonathan Cohn, policy director at the advocacy group Progressive Mass, said it’s clear from Cusack’s November version of the energy affordability bill that he isn’t taking his cues from groups like Sierra Club anyway. 
“From the universe of not wanting to deny yourself access, if you never had access to begin with, there’s at least not as much in the way of real loss,” Cohn said. “And evaluating how back in November environmental groups across the state were able to rally members and make enough representatives scared to vote yes on his bill, it showed that power lies in that ability to have an organized and mobilized grassroots base. Trying to defeat that bill on the basis of only talking to the highest people in the building was not going to be a viable strategy.” 
House lawmakers met for six hours behind closed doors last week to find consensus on a high-profile energy affordability package. Healey herself is looking to show voters she’s willing to take on the issue as she heads into an election year. 
“I filed energy affordability legislation to get us more power, get costs down, and save you $13 billion,” she said in her annual State of the Commonwealth speech last week, where she outlined a plan to cut utility rates in February and March. “Our strategy on supply is ‘all of the above’ — wind, solar, hydro, gas, nuclear – whatever it takes to power our homes and businesses and cut your costs.” 
But Sierra Club’s willingness to play attack dog represents the latest wrinkle in the bill’s topsy turvy process thus far and, despite uncertainty over how it will land in the State House, is a risk the group is taking on.  
Some advocates, though, are trying to put distance between their groups and Sierra Club’s move to call on Cusack to be removed from his post as chair. 
“None of us like the … bill, but the action has moved to Ways and Means,” one advocate said, underscoring the point that Cusack has a less singularly important but still influential role in crafting the bill than he did last year. “We’re encouraging interested people to keep engaging with all House members.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9829-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-27 09:57:34.771858

Photo by H. Jiahong Pan/Minnesota ReformerAn ill-advised post on official White House social media may have damaged the Trump administration’s own case against at least one of the people who disrupted Sunday service at a St. Paul church where a pastor is a top Twin Cities immigration enforcement official, legal experts say. 
The post, shared Thursday, depicts a federal agent escorting Twin Cities attorney and civil rights activist Nekima Levy Armstrong earlier that morning. The agent’s face is blurred; Levy Armstrong’s appears contorted and covered in tears.
But the image from the White House differed starkly from the one Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on her official X account 30 minutes earlier, showing Levy Armstrong gazing placidly into the distance. The New York Times ran the White House’s image through Resemble.AI, an AI detection system, and “concluded that it showed signs of manipulation.” 
Within hours, the White House confirmed to CNN reporter Daniel Dale that the image it posted was indeed altered. A spokesperson shrugged it off: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”
The problem for the government: The prosecution is banned from making statements — including social media posts — that could influence potential jurors’ feelings about a case. The American Bar Association’s code of professional conduct warns prosecutors and their associates to “refrain from making extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused.”
Levy Armstrong’s attorney, Jordan Kushner, did not respond to the Reformer’s requests for comment. In a press conference following Levy Armstrong’s arraignment Thursday, Kushner called the charges “political” and “not a legitimate prosecution.” 
The case against Levy Armstrong is among those that arose out of the extraordinary pushback from Minnesota residents against Trump’s immigration crackdown in the state. Matters have intensified since the enforcement began in December, and especially with the recent fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti at the hands of federal officers. 
Pete Johnson, a Minneapolis-based criminal defense lawyer with prior experience as a state and county prosecutor, said prosecutors have to be careful about what they say before bringing a case to trial.
“Anytime there’s potentially prejudicial pretrial publicity, that can affect the case…you don’t give your opinion and try to make your case in the media because it can prejudice the jury pool,” Johnson said.
He said the risk is twofold. First, defense attorneys can invoke prosecutors’ extrajudicial comments in pretrial motions challenging the legitimacy of the charges. And second, he said, “I think there are serious ethical issues involved in trying to tarnish a person in the public eye and the media instead of letting the court process play out.”
Senior U.S. law enforcement officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel, have said the activists violated a 30-year-old law intended to prevent forceful interference with religious worship, medical consultations and other activities protected by the First Amendment. 
In the post announcing Levy Armstrong’s arrest, Noem referred to the disruption at Cities Church last weekend as “the Church Riots in St. Paul, Minnesota.”
Ken White, a Los Angeles-based criminal defense attorney and “First Amendment litigator,” said in a series of recent social media posts that federal prosecutors would need to make the case that the activists “used the threat of force and physical obstruction” to interfere with and intimidate congregants.
“From what I have seen that’s very questionable, and would make any protest in a church automatically a violation of the statute,” White said. He added that the defendants could challenge the case on grounds that it interfered with their own First Amendment rights, though they might not succeed. 
“Selective and vindictive prosecution challenges” would be harder to prove, White said.
Federal law enforcement officials say more charges could be on the way in the Cities Church case, but it’s unclear when those will come or whether they’ll stick. 
Citing an anonymous source, PBS News reported that a Twin Cities judge rejected prosecutors’ request to charge the independent journalist and former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was present at the protest. The report follows an apparent pattern of local judges rebuffing prosecutors seeking to arrest people protesting federal law enforcement actions in the Twin Cities.
In a statement posted to Lemon’s YouTube channel, Lemon’s attorney said the veteran reporter’s actions last weekend were “no different than what he has done for more than 30 years, reporting and covering newsworthy events on the ground and engaging in constitutionally protected activity as a journalist.” 
Johnson said he couldn’t comment on the specifics of Lemon’s case, but added that courts expect prosecutors not to bring cases that are likely to be thrown out on First Amendment grounds or otherwise have slim chances of success.
“Prosecutors will regularly decline to bring a case, saying we can’t prove (it) beyond a reasonable doubt,” he said.
So far in President Trump’s second term, however, senior federal law enforcement officials have appeared willing to flout this longstanding norm of “prosecutorial discretion” in cases with high political or personal salience for Trump. 
Under Pam Bondi, Trump’s attorney general, the U.S. Department of Justice has brought questionable prosecutions against Trump’s perceived enemies, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who both had charges dismissed against them. 
“Even being charged and brought into court is a costly and burdensome position to be in” for a defendant, Johnson said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nekima-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 09:57:34.771858

Can artificial intelligence help medical professionals treat California’s unhoused population? Or will the technology open a can of worms that critics say may do more harm than good?
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall explains, Los Angeles-based Akido Labs plans to use an AI model it developed on unhoused patients next month in the Bay Area. Akido, a health care technology company, developed Scope AI, a tool that aims to increase health care access for homeless people.
Scope assists non-medically trained outreach workers in beginning the intake and diagnosis process with homeless patients. The tool generates questions that workers ask patients, and it listens to, records and transcribes the interview. Afterwards, Scope suggests diagnoses, medical tests and medication.
The information is then sent to a human doctor, who reviews the interaction and can sign off on Scope’s medication suggestions or make changes. For more complex cases, doctors can arrange to see the patient themselves.
As early as 2023, Aikido’s outreach workers have been using Scope in homeless encampments in L.A. County, where it has since seen more than 5,000 patients. Scope lands on the correct diagnoses within its top three suggestions 99% of the time, according to Akido, and street medicine doctors in L.A. and Kern counties have increased their case load from roughly 200 homeless patients at a time to 350 after implementing Scope.
But critics have concerns about the AI’s reliability, how it could put patient’s data at risk and how it could reinforce biases. AI is more likely, for example, to misdiagnose breast cancer in Black women than in white women, according to a 2024 study.
Because of their increased vulnerability and unique circumstances, homeless patients also may not be treated as precisely by AI compared to a human health care provider. A patient with scabies, for example, would typically be prescribed special shampoo or body wash, said Brett Feldman, founder of USC Street Medicine. But for an unhoused person who does not have regular access to a bathroom, an oral medication may be needed. Would AI know to flag that detail? 

Feldman: “I would say, in general, that this would not work for this population.”

Bills seek more physical contact on detention visits

From CalMatters politics reporter Maya C. Miller:
A forthcoming set of legislative proposals would create physical contact guidelines for inmates in adult and juvenile detention facilities that want to embrace loved ones during scheduled visitation time. 
The pair of bills from Democratic Assemblymembers Isaac Bryan of Culver City and Mark Gonzalez of Los Angeles, set to be introduced today, would codify acceptable forms of physical affection that currently vary from prison to prison. 
Gonzalez said he was inspired to author the bill after visiting the California Institution for Women in Chino, where several inmates said they hadn’t been able to hold their children in years.

Gonzalez: “When a child is born, the first thing you do is you have that physical touch with your mother, or in some cases, the father. Having that physical touch makes a huge difference.”

According to Bryan’s office, at some juvenile detention facilities, staff can immediately terminate a visit over any contact between the youth and a visitor, even their family members. 
The authors do not anticipate any opposition to the bills.



Anti-pollution draft rules aren’t tough enough, critics say

Ten years ago, California passed a law that aims to shore up the permitting process for hazardous waste facilities. The law enables the state’s Department of Toxic Substances Control to consider the cumulative impact of pollution in its permitting process. But the rules the law requires are seven years late, and critics say they still don’t do enough to protect vulnerable communities, writes CalMatters’ Alejandra Reyes-Velarde.
According to DTSC’s draft rules, waste facilities that want new permits will be required to profile the demographics and environmental risks of communities within a one-mile radius. If a surrounding community ranks in the top 25% in CalEnviroScreen — a state tool that screens communities for environmental harm — the facility must write a more detailed report. 
But critics of the proposal say the only way a permit could be denied is based on the pollution from the waste facility itself, not the cumulative pollution impacts in the area. Advocates also argue that the rule’s reliance on air quality status and CalEnviroScreen rankings is problematic. Much of the CalEnviroScreen data, for example, is self-reported from polluters.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: The Legislature’s frustration over the state budget was evident during last week’s budget hearings, where lawmakers could only speculate how to manage the deficit in the absence of specifics from Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Increasing or removing weight limits for semi-trucks would put California communities at risk, generate serious safety concerns and raise infrastructure costs, writes Jorgel Chavez, Bell Gardens City Councilmember.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Attorney General Alan Wilson “opposes woke gender ideology on government passports” or “fights against burdensome gun restrictions” or “leads fight for religious liberty,” the announcements read.
Such headlines in statements from the state’s top prosecutor are commonplace — sometimes multiple times a week.
In the past year alone, Wilson’s office announced joining other Republicans on more than 60 multi-state lawsuits. That includes filings earlier this month in a pair of lawsuits challenging blue states’ gun laws — a New Jersey law banning guns from parks, beaches and “public gatherings,” and a California law requiring background checks for every ammunition sale.
Other past lawsuits involve transgender treatments for people in prison, access to bathrooms, and President Donald Trump’s executive orders on birthright citizenship and deploying National Guard troops to major cities.
Almost all of the multi-state efforts announced by Wilson in the past year involve Republicans only, though at least one case was bipartisan: Democratic attorneys general also signed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting a Florida law aimed at protecting children from the harms of social media.
Keeping the watch for litigation the Palmetto State may want to get involved in falls to a four-person team in the state attorney general’s office. It’s the state solicitor general and his deputies who spend their days combing through court filings and on biweekly phone meetings with similar teams in attorneys general offices across the country.
“There’s a small staff of attorneys that that’s all they do,” Wilson told the SC Daily Gazette. “They’re constantly keeping me read in on things we may need to engage in.”
A question of cost
The topic of these multi-state and national suits came up during a November legislative hearing reviewing Wilson and his team.
“Like everybody else, I see the news that Attorney General Wilson is holding a press conference. He’s suing the Biden administration. He’s backing up the Trump administration. He’s involved in litigation involving the border or whatever it might be,” said Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, D-Orangeburg. “You’re choosing to get involved in that litigation and it seems very political on its face.”
He asked: How much do these endeavors cost and who pays for them?
“I would argue that the expense to the state for us not to challenge some of these things is greater than the expense of bringing a case,” Wilson responded.
Generally, Wilson said, the costs are the salaries of those four employees, several of which top $100,000, according to the state employee salary database.
The time it takes to draft, edit and circulate briefs for all of the states to sign on to is split among those involved.
“We’re constantly talking to our sister states,” the former chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association told the Daily Gazette.
It was Wilson who, in 2013 — about 2 ½ years after he took office — created the solicitor general position.
Wilson tapped Bob Cook, who at the time was a 36-year veteran of the attorney general’s office. Cook remained in the role until just this past May, when Wilson promoted one of Cook’s deputies to the position. Cook, who became solicitor general emeritus, remains a senior legal adviser.
Whether the practice will continue with South Carolina’s next attorney general remains to be seen.
Three Republicans are vying for the GOP nomination to replace Wilson. No Democrat has announced a bid.
Republican state Sen. Stephen Goldfinch made clear when he entered the race — two weeks after Wilson announced his own bid for the Governor’s Mansion — that he believes South Carolina should sue the federal government, as Wilson did with the Obama and Biden administrations, and fight Democrat-led initiatives in court. First Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe said he’d keep a team in place to help monitor federal issues but would prioritize matters directly impacting the Palmetto State.
“I’m a South Carolina first person,” he said Monday. “If it affects us, I won’t need to see what other states do. I will punch back. If not, then it’s going to be on my backburner.”
Eight Circuit Solicitor David Stumbo did not respond to messages from the Daily Gazette.
When to sign on
There are several reasons for inserting South Carolina into a court fight, he said.
“Though critics would claim it’s to make headlines,” Wilson said.
The first reason, according to Wilson, is that South Carolina might have a similar law or want to avoid a federal rule that contradicts existing state law. If South Carolina doesn’t join a challenge elsewhere, it won’t benefit from any rulings granting temporary protections while the litigation makes its way through the courts.
“If we don’t get involved, we get left out, having to litigate it by ourselves,” Wilson said.
The Title IX example
Wilson pointed to a series of cases filed in federal court to stop the Biden administration’s changes to Title IX rules, which extended the definition of sex discrimination in the 1972 law to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Democrats praised the changes as needed protections for LGBTQ+ students. Republicans’ complaints included what it meant for school bathrooms.
Within days of the rules’ release in April 2024, state Superintendent Ellen Weaver urged school districts to disregard them. The Senate voted to require the opposite — inserting into the state budget a law threatening to withhold classroom aid from school districts that let transgender students use multi-stall restrooms and locker rooms corresponding to their gender identity.
And Wilson joined with Alabama, Florida and Georgia in a lawsuit to stop the rules. In all, 26 states filed or joined multiple lawsuits.
If South Carolina hadn’t signed on to one of the cases, schools in the state would have been required to follow the changes, Wilson said. But a federal appeals ruling blocked them for all South Carolina schools a day before they were set to take effect Aug. 1, 2024. Five months later, a federal judge in Kentucky threw out the changes for all schools nationwide, saying the pronoun requirements violated free speech rights and all 1,500 pages overstepped the president’s authority.
As for the state budget rule, a federal lawsuit challenging it is on pause pending a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on laws in West Virginia and Idaho on transgender athletes. That ruling could also impact South Carolina’s similar law on school sports passed in 2022. Wilson was among 28 GOP attorneys general to sign on to briefs in both suits.
Rulings on other states’ laws impacting SC
The second reason for signing on to an outside case, Wilson said, is when a lawsuit in another state appears to be moving through the courts more quickly than a South Carolina case. Any decision might aid the state in its own legal battle, Wilson said.
As an example, he pointed to his office’s decision to file a brief in a Tennessee case over the Volunteer State’s law banning puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 last June that the Tennessee law does not violate the 14th Amendment.
ACLU drops challenge to SC law that stopped transition-related medical treatments

The American Civil Liberties Union initially said it would continue to fight a similar but more expansive South Carolina law that also affected adults.
Months later, however, the ACLU’s attorneys reluctantly dropped its lawsuit on behalf of South Carolina families. The decision followed the U.S. Supreme Court asking a lower court to reconsider rulings requiring government-funded health plans in North Carolina and West Virginia to cover transgender treatments. Wilson was among 24 GOP attorneys general to weigh in on those cases.
Other reasons
South Carolina might also sign on in cases involving “a broad issue of great importance” and while it may not be immediately obvious “these national suits involve local interests,” Wilson said.
Wilson gave legislators the example of a Texas case. Wilson co-led a brief, signed by 21 GOP states, supporting Texas’ ability to police its southern border.
“That was viewed by many as a political distinction. But I also did it because we have fentanyl pouring into this state like Niagara Falls,” Wilson said. “And so, when I bring national lawsuits, I’m bringing these lawsuits because I would rather fight them in other states than wait for them to pop up here in South Carolina.”
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey told reporters he thought the attorney general’s explanation sounded reasonable.
“It also makes sense to me that, if you can get involved in somebody else’s lawsuit and you can spend a little bit of money to get the answer, then you don’t have to spend a lot of money to get the answer in your own lawsuit,” the Edgefield Republican said.
A different take
But a spokesman for the ACLU said Wilson should be more careful about what suits he joins, particularly if they don’t affect South Carolina and may actually harm South Carolinians.
Paul Bowers pointed to a Texas case Wilson signed on to that challenged a Biden administration rule adding gender dysphoria to the list of recognized disabilities. But the lawsuit’s wording threatened to strike an entire section of a 1973 law protecting people with disabilities from discrimination.
After public backlash, Wilson was among 17 Republican state attorneys general who submitted a new brief last February to clarify their position.
“It’s emblematic of the types of cases the attorney general gets involved,” Bowers said. “It in can range from merely performative to the actively harmful.”
Wilson also was the lead author on a brief signed by the Republican attorneys general of 14 other states in a brief blasting a $500 million penalty levied against Trump in New York for a civil business fraud case brought by that state’s Democratic attorney general.
The attorneys general claimed many of their states conduct business in New York City and “need confidence that their customary business dealings in New York will not subject them to devastating fines,” Wilson’s brief read. He declared victory when an appeals court dismissed the fine as excessive.
And in December 2020, Wilson joined 16 other GOP attorneys general in a friend-of-the court brief supporting a Texas lawsuit that challenged pandemic changes to absentee and mail-in voting in four states. The brief questioned the legality of changes not approved by those states’ legislators.
Bowers said it was all about discrediting Biden’s win.
“That was subverting democracy. It’s to our state’s shame we were signed onto it,” Bowers said.
Who leads
Which state or states lead court filings on a national issue is often negotiated among the participating attorneys, Wilson said. It’s often based on who has prior experience on an issue.
For example, Wilson found himself taking the lead on labor union issues after former Gov. Nikki Haley fought off efforts by machinists to unionize at Boeing’s North Charleston plant.
As a colonel in the South Carolina National Guard, Wilson is also often tapped to lead on lawsuits involving the military, he told the Daily Gazette.
When South Carolina leads the sign-on in a case, it’s up to attorneys in Wilson’s office to write the first draft of what’s called a friend-of-the-court brief. The draft is then circulated to other participating states for possible edits.
“The bandwidth is shared so it’s not like we’re sitting there wasting a thousand man hours,” Wilson said. “It’s mostly done over emails and phone calls.”
Most of the time, South Carolina isn’t actually sending lawyers to court hearings across the country. The time commitment is in the form of doing legal research to pinpoint the best arguments.
“I have 90 lawyers on my staff advising me on what we need to be doing,” Wilson said. “I do not make these decisions in a vacuum or by myself in a room. These are career attorneys with no political agenda.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The fatal shooting of a Minnesota man at the hands of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents could splinter one of President Donald Trump’s most loyal special interests groups – the gun lobby, and may have implications for 2026 federal and state elections, including in Nevada.  
Following the fatal shooting by ICE agents of Minneapolis resident Renee Good earlier this month, and the government’s refusal to investigate the actions of agents, some 61% of Americans polled said they oppose ICE’s tactics in seeking out undocumented criminals.  
Now, an insulated investigation and snap judgments from Trump administration officials, such as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, have Americans again questioning the veracity of government accounts of violent incidents involving ICE. 
Noem, without any evidence, deemed Good and Alex Pretti, the man killed Saturday, “domestic terrorists” and gave recounts of the incidents that are inconsistent with video images of both shootings, including the assertion that Pretti, who was holding his cell phone, was “brandishing” a weapon.
“Kristi Noem has been an abject failure leading the Department of Homeland Security for the last year – and the abuses of power we’re seeing from ICE are the latest proof that she has lost control over her own department and staff,” Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said in a news release Saturday. “She’s either too incompetent to rein in the agency under her purview, or she endorses the blatant constitutional violations being committed.” 
In a move that raises questions about the administration’s objectives, in a letter Saturday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi admonished Gov. Tim Walz to get on board the administration’s efforts by opening state data, including voter rolls, to the Department of Justice. 
Even Republican officials are pushing back on Trump’s initiative. 
Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday the Trump administration needs to “recalibrate” its mission.
“This is a real tragedy,” Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican and chair of the National Governors Association, said Sunday on CNN. “And I think the death of Americans, what we’re seeing on TV, it’s causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability. Americans don’t like what they’re seeing right now.” 
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has hitched his reelection wagon to Trump and his efforts to rid the U.S. of undocumented immigrants, did not respond to questions from the Current about the shootings. Lombardo has repeatedly pledged fealty to Trump’s efforts to rid the U.S. of undocumented immigrants. 
“Under the leadership of Governor Lombardo, the State of Nevada is committed to addressing our nation’s immigration crisis, and in continuing to take steps to ensure Nevada does not offer sanctuary to illegal aliens,” the administration said in an agreement between the state and the Department of Justice sanctuary jurisdictions in September.
“I am heartbroken today and also outraged” about the violence in Minnesota, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alexis Hill said in a statement Sunday, adding that officials “must come together to stand up against this unacceptable abuse of power.”
Hill noted that Nevada contracts with ICE at three detention centers in the state, and questioned the care and legal services available to detainees. 
“Gov. Lombardo owes Nevadans a clear accountability and transparency of all state resources that have been used supporting ICE,” Hill said.
Cooperation with ICE “requires transparency and accountability from the governor to follow state laws,” Hill said, citing cooperation between the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles and ICE. The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada filed a lawsuit against the state regarding communications with ICE, and is asking the state to conduct an independent investigation and seeks “full disclosure by the governor of any and all existences of cooperation between ICE and the DMV.”   
“The safety of American citizens is not a Democrat or Republican issue. When Americans are dying at the hands of federal agents, that’s not a successful mission. It’s a failure,” Ford said in a statement Monday afternoon. “ICE’s federal overreach has gone too far. And the President let an operation move forward that was poorly planned, poorly executed, and needlessly violent, resulting in masked federal agents taking the lives of Americans.”

Ford said it’s “shameful” that Lombardo “refuses to speak out or stand up to President Trump.  That’s not leadership. I assure the residents of Nevada that I will use every resource available to me to keep our communities protected.”
Adriana Guzman Fralick, a Republican who is running for Attorney General, said she condones ICE’s tactics. 
“They’re trying to do a job. They’ve got orders,” Fralick said when reached by phone Monday. “If you put yourself in their position, they have to go and try to get a criminal. We put into office the president to do a job. He was elected to do what we want him to do.” 
Fralick’s Republican primary opponent, Danny Tarkanian, says he supports ICE’s efforts to remove “violent illegal immigrants from our communities, and from our country, and I will continue to support the President in this mission.” 
Tarkanian called the videos of Pretti being shot “horrific” but added he doesn’t have all the evidence. He urged officials to complete an investigation, and if the evidence warrants, “a jury of our peers should in a public forum scrutinize what happened and make an informed decision.”
Tarkanian said Nevada has avoided violence “because we are not a sanctuary state with sanctuary local jurisdictions.  We avoid chaos and divisiveness when federal, state, and local law enforcement work together to rid our communities of violent criminals, and my hope is that Tim Walz and other leaders in Minnesota will act accordingly.”
State Treasurer Zach Conine, a Democrat who is running for Attorney General, said in a statement that ICE agents “are acting outside of the scope afforded to them through the Constitution, existing federal law, and Department of Homeland Security policy.”
“Americans have stood up to executive overreach for over 250 years,” Conine said. “We must protect Nevadans’ freedoms of speech and peaceful assembly along with freedom from unreasonable search and seizure. Defending states’ rights and individuals’ freedoms is essential for ensuring our nation’s future prosperity.”
Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, a Democrat who is running for Attorney General, said the immigration enforcement activities in Minneapolis “have created a public safety crisis, including numerous documented instances of violations of residents’ constitutional rights.” The White House and Department of Homeland Security, she said, “immediately worked to block any independent investigations, proving that they cannot be trusted to impartially uphold the law.”
Cannizzaro called on Congress this week to reject funding measures for DHS absent a requirement that authorities “scale down operations that are inflaming tensions and to conduct enforcement activities in line with the requirements of the First and Fourth Amendment.”
DHS funding narrowly passed the U.S. House of Representatives last week, but both of Nevada’s Democratic senators, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, issues statements Monday saying they would not support the bill in the Senate.
Meanwhile, Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that marked up the DHS funding bill in the House, told the Nevada Independent that “there needs to be a pivot” in the administration’s enforcement policies because “we are not in a good place right now.”
Lawfully carrying
The killing of Pretti is raising questions about the implications of legally carrying a weapon in the Trump era. 
Border Control Commander Gregory Bovino, who referred to Pretti during a news conference as an “assassin” who intended to “massacre law enforcement”  asserted during a CNN interview that Pretti had no Second Amendment right to carry. 
“We respect that Second Amendment right, but those rights don’t count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct, and impede law enforcement officers — and most especially when you mean to do that beforehand,” he said.  
“People should not fear interacting with police officers just because they are lawfully carrying,” the Second Amendment Foundation said via email, adding the claim that carrying a firearm near law enforcement “is enough to justify them using lethal force” amounts to “an affront to the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.”
Bill Essayli, the president’s appointee as First Assistant of California’s Central District, said on social media that “if you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you,” adding, “Don’t do it.” 
“Federal agents are not ‘highly likely’ to be ‘legally justified’ in ‘shooting’ concealed carry licensees who approach while lawfully carrying a firearm,” the National Rifle Association said. “The Second Amendment protects Americans’ right to bear arms while protesting ‒ a right the federal government must not infringe upon.”
The principal is not new to Lombardo who was sheriff of Clark County in 2020 when Metro officers fired 19 rounds at 25 year-old Jorge Gomez, as he walked toward his vehicle after a Black Lives Matter protest in downtown Las Vegas. Police acknowledged that during the protest they surveilled Gomez, who was openly carrying a rifle.  
Late last year, a jury awarded Gomez’ family $6.5 million in a civil case. Four officers who shot Gomez were never charged.  
During his campaign, Trump pledged his deportation efforts would target the “worst of the worst,” but has since revised his game plan in favor of sweeping, untargeted apprehension efforts that frequently ensnare so-called ‘low-hanging fruit’ – immigrants with no criminal background.
Trump, who maintained a hard line following the killing of Good, eventually acknowledged ICE agents “make mistakes sometimes.” Trump is sending Border Czar Tom Homan to Minnesota in an apparent attempt to calm the turbulence. 
On Monday, Trump posted that Walz called him seeking cooperation. “It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” the president said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alexpretti-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 08:57:26.129942

Meanwhile, however, he must spend at least some of his time governing California and dealing with a Legislature dominated by his fellow Democrats but increasingly less willing to cater to his whims.
Newsom’s relationship with legislators has always been more transactional than collaborative. He has even used the annual budget process to force them to adopt major policy changes with little or no scrutiny. Legislators often grumbled about being squeezed by Newsom, but felt compelled — not always but most of the time — to go along. 
However, their annoyance is becoming more public, as indicated during legislative hearings on his final budget last week. 
Newsom’s initial $349 billion budget for the 2026-27 fiscal year is, as administration officials acknowledge, merely a placeholder. It continues the current budget, with a few tweaks, but won’t be fleshed out until May, just a month before the June 15 constitutional deadline.
This year the squeeze is particularly bothersome because the Legislature’s budget advisor, Gabe Petek, and Department of Finance officials are both warning that the state faces large and growing budget deficits after Newsom departs.
The frustration was evident during last week’s introductory hearings for budget committees. Legislators heard Petek advise that they deal with the forecasted deficit sooner rather than later, and discussed remedies ranging from sharp cuts in spending to sharp increases in taxes. 
But in the absence of specifics from Newsom, they could only speculate.
Newsom has steadily opposed major tax increases, even though it was his administration’s immense error in revenue projections four years ago that helped create what officials call a “structural deficit,” meaning that the revenue system cannot generate enough money to pay for all the programs and services now offered.
The administration’s 2022 revenue projection error of $165 billion over four years led to Newsom declaring a $98 billion budget surplus and a sharp increase in spending, especially on social services. As an ideological tenet, Democratic legislators dislike cutting those enhancements to balance the budget, which is why increasing taxes was repeatedly mentioned during last week’s hearings.
The comments of state Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat, typified the squeeze that Democratic legislators are feeling. She called one of Newsom’s health care proposals, scaling back Med-Cal benefits to undocumented immigrants, “barbaric.” 
“I’m disappointed that there’s no proposal to change how our revenues come in,” Menjivar said. “We can’t just cut our way out of it. I think there should be a mixture of cuts, being strategic with how we use our dollars, but also looking to change our revenue streams.”
While the angst over the budget is palpable, reductions in federal support for expensive health and welfare programs, imposed by President Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress, raise the stakes even more. If they had their way, some Democrats would not only raise taxes to cover the state’s structural deficit but backstop the reductions in federal aid. 
Meanwhile, public employee unions and their allies are proposing two November ballot measures to bolster revenues: a one-time wealth tax on the state’s billionaires, and an extension of a temporary surtax on high-income taxpayers that was imposed in 2012 to close a budget deficit and later extended to 2030.
The situation leads to more questions than answers.
Will Newsom keep his promise to close this year’s deficit and the ones projected for the future?
With a presidential campaign likely in the offing, will he maintain his anti-tax increase posture?
Will Democratic legislators insist that taxes be raised to balance the budget without deep spending cuts?
In an eyeball-to-eyeball scenario, we will see who blinks first.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010625_Limon-Senate-Pro-Tem_MG_CM_19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-27 08:57:26.129942

The technology promises better access to health care, but it also raises questions.","In summary
A California company is using AI to help diagnose homeless Californians. The technology promises better access to health care, but it also raises questions.


As AI expands into every facet of society, a California company is testing whether the technology can help improve the health of people living on the streets.
Akido Labs, a Los Angeles-based health care technology company that runs clinics and street medicine teams in California, plans to start using its AI model on homeless and housing insecure patients in the Bay Area next month. The program generates questions for outreach workers to ask patients and then suggests diagnoses, medical tests and even medication, which a human doctor then signs off on remotely. The idea is to save doctors time and allow them to see more patients.
The new model, called Scope AI, is addressing a very real problem: There aren’t nearly enough doctors visiting encampments and shelters. At the same time, homeless Californians are in much poorer health and are dying earlier than the general population. 
“There are individuals who haven’t seen doctors for years. There are individuals who haven’t seen a dentist ever,” said Steve Good, president and CEO of Five Keys, which is partnering with Akido to launch the AI technology in its San Francisco homeless shelters. “There just aren’t enough resources to go in there and find out the needs these individuals have.”
Experts who research AI told CalMatters that if done right, the technology has the power to increase access to care for homeless and other marginalized communities. But while many health care providers already are using AI for administrative duties, such as transcribing patient visits, using it to help diagnose people is still a relatively new field. It brings up concerns around data privacy, biases and patient outcomes, which are particularly pressing when the technology is being used on homeless patients and other vulnerable groups. 
“We don’t have perfect solutions to a lot of these challenges yet,” said Angel Hsing-Chi Hwang, an assistant professor at USC who researches human-AI interaction. 
How Scope uses AI to diagnose homeless patients
Scope AI essentially allows non-medically trained outreach workers to start the intake and diagnosis process before a patient sees a doctor. 
An outreach worker goes out into the field with Scope on their tablet or laptop. As they start interviewing a patient, Scope suggests questions the outreach worker should ask. Scope listens to, records and transcribes the interview, and as the interaction progresses, it suggests new questions based on what the patient says. 
When it has enough information, Scope suggests diagnoses, prescriptions and follow-up tests. That information is then sent to a human doctor, who reviews it (usually the same day) and either signs off on the prescriptions, makes changes, or, if it’s a more complex case, arranges to see the patient to get additional information. The medical care is paid for by Medi-Cal through its CalAIM expansion into social services.

In demonstrating the technology to CalMatters, using an imaginary 56-year-old female patient who complained of trouble breathing, Scope asked several follow-up questions to drill down on her symptoms. Then, it made suggestions that included: a diagnosis of COPD or chronic bronchitis, a chest x-ray and spirometry breathing test, and a prescription of an albuterol inhaler.
The Scope AI technology is already being used in a few target areas. Akido’s street medicine teams began using it in homeless encampments in Los Angeles County in 2023, where it has since seen more than 5,000 patients. Akido also uses AI in encampments in Kern County, clinics in California and Rhode Island, and to treat ride-share workers in New York. 
“I would say, in general, that this would not work for this population.”Brett Feldman, director, USC Street Medicine
Scope lands on the correct diagnoses within its top three suggestions 99% of the time, according to Akido. 
Other studies have called into question the reliability of diagnoses made by artificial intelligence. A 2024 study, for example, found that AI was significantly more likely to misdiagnose breast cancer in Black women than in white women. 
The infiltration of AI into homeless services has sparked concern from some critics who argue homeless patients, because of their increased vulnerability, need a human health care provider.
“We should not experiment on patients who are unhoused or have low incomes for an AI rollout,” Leah Goodridge, a tenants rights attorney and housing policy expert, and Dr. Oni Blackstock, a physician and executive director of Health Justice, wrote in a recent opinion piece for the Guardian. 
Brett Feldman, director of USC Street Medicine, agrees.  When someone is homeless, much of their health status is dependent on their living environment, he told CalMatters. For example, he recently treated a patient with scabies. Typically, he would prescribe a shampoo or body wash, but this patient had no access to a shower — a key detail that AI might not know to ask. 
Instead, he prescribed an oral medication. The patient needed one dose right away, and another dose in a week. He had to decide whether to give the patient the second dose now and trust that it wouldn’t get lost or stolen, ask the patient to travel to a pharmacy to pick up the second dose, or try to find the patient again in a week to deliver the dose. AI couldn’t make that complex calculation, and neither could a doctor who hadn’t met the patient and seen their living situation, Feldman said. 
And any missteps the AI makes could have outsized consequences when a patient is homeless, Feldman said. If the patient has an issue with the medication prescribed, they likely don’t have an easy way to contact the doctor or have a follow-up appointment.
“I would say, in general, that this would not work for this population,” Feldman said.
Akido argues the benefit of AI is clear: better efficiency and improved access to health care. 
Before introducing AI, each of Akido’s street medicine doctors in LA and Kern counties could carry a case load of about 200 homeless patients at a time, said Karthik Murali, head of safety net programs for the company. Now, it’s closer to 350 patients per doctor, he said, because doctors spend less time asking routine questions and filling out paperwork. 
That means more patients get access to care and medication more quickly, Murali said. 
Nearly a quarter of homeless Californians surveyed by the UCSF Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative reported needing medical care that they couldn’t get in the six months prior to the study. Only 39% said they had a primary care provider. Nearly half of homeless Californians surveyed reported their health as poor or fair — a rate about four times higher than the general U.S. population. 
Good, of Five Keys, hopes the technology also will let clinicians build trust and deeper relationships with their clients. An outreach worker using Scope will have time to form a bond with the patient and better respond to their individual needs, as opposed to a doctor who is rushing through the visit to get to the next patient, he said. 
His organization hopes to roll out the technology in some of its San Francisco homeless shelters next month. 
Partnerships and access
Akido also plans to work with Reimagine Freedom and the Young Women’s Freedom Center to use the AI technology at four centers — in San Francisco, Oakland, Richmond and San Jose — that serve women and girls who are or have been incarcerated. The clients they serve often had poor access to health care while in jail or prison, or had their medical concerns ignored, said Reimagine Freedom President Jessica Nowlan. Many have no trust in the medical system.
Currently, the centers offer health education. This new AI technology will allow them to provide actual medical care, Nowlan said. 
“Our guess is we will see a huge increase in women being able to access health and care for themselves,” she said. 
Reimagine Freedom started testing Scope AI at its Los Angeles clinic in November. So far, “it’s going really well,” Nowlan said. 
Akido plans to partner with additional homeless service providers who can help it roll out its AI technology in more places throughout the Bay Area.
If providers who serve vulnerable patients are left out of the AI race, any benefits in the technology will go to wealthy communities instead — further widening the gap between the haves and have-nots, said Stella Tran, who researches AI companies for a California Health Care Foundation investment fund. That’s why social service providers need to be involved in testing this technology and developing the ground rules and safety checks, she said. 
But that doesn’t mean Tran doesn’t have concerns. For example, AI works differently on different communities. An algorithm that produced accurate diagnoses for patients in Los Angeles might not work as well in the Bay Area, she said. And while AI has the potential to be less racially biased than human doctors, it all depends on how the algorithm is constructed.
“I think there is a potential to increase access if we do it right,” Tran said, “with the right set of guardrails and being thoughtful about safety, transparency to patients, consent, all of that.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/053124-Bakersfield-Injectable-LV_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-27 08:57:26.129942

That would further damage California’s aging bridges and congested roads.","Guest Commentary written by

Jorgel Chavez
Jorgel Chavez is a Bell Gardens City Councilmember.


Truck weight is a top concern for southeast Los Angeles County, including Bell Gardens, as Congress considers proposals that would add 11,000 pounds to the current weight limit of 80,000 pounds for semi-trucks.
At least one proposal under consideration would remove truck weight limits entirely.
These bills are aimed at reducing shipping costs for huge corporations. But they also would put our communities at risk, generating serious safety concerns and higher infrastructure costs.
Trucks above the standard 80,000-pound limit cause more crashes and result in a higher rate of fatalities than lighter trucks, a federal study shows. There were more than 12,000 large-truck crashes, resulting in nearly 400 deaths and more than 5,300 injured victims, in California in 2023.
Many of the state’s roads and bridges weren’t designed to have the current level and weight of truck traffic of today. Bigger, heavier tractor trailers will put more strain and inflict more damage on our already heavily used infrastructure.
Clearly California drivers don’t need bigger trucks leaving worse ruts in the roads to swerve around. And anyone who’s traversed the 710 freeway knows trucks are a major contributor to daily gridlock.
Bigger tractor trailers also would add wear and tear to bridges. California’s bridges were never meant to handle 91,000-pound trucks. It doesn’t make sense to increase stress on bridges that are already in poor condition 
Of the 1,227 local bridges in Los Angeles County, for instance, 515 are already graded in “fair” or “poor” condition. At least 121 of those bridges would need to be replaced by ones that can support 91,000-pound trucks. The replacement cost: more than $683 million dollars, according to federal bridge data and the Coalition Against Bigger Trucks.
California has 12,426 locally maintained bridges. Of those 7,433 are rated fair or poor by the Federal Highway Administration. A review of federal bridges concludes 2,841  would need replacement to safely accommodate 91,000-pound trucks. The cost would exceed $8.1 billion, much of it coming from county and municipal government coffers.
Opposition to bigger trucks comes from every state and transcends political parties.  Recently more than 2,200 local government leaders from all 50 states sent a letter to Congress, saying bigger trucks would make a bad situation worse.
“Much of our transportation infrastructure that connects people to jobs, schools and leisure is in disrepair, in part because local and rural roads and bridges are older and not built to the same standards as interstates,” they wrote.
“Many of us are unable to keep up with our current maintenance schedules and replacement costs because of underfunded budgets. The impacts of heavier or longer tractor-trailers would only worsen these problems.”
As the most populated state, with more than 39 million people, California should be honest about what is safe and efficient for our roads. No time is the right time to add extra weight or length to commercial vehicles using our roadways.
Elected officials and citizens must stand together to support new and innovative ideas in transportation but oppose those that prioritize corporate profit over motorist safety and community infrastructure.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2040418-Semi-Trucks-Port-of-Long-Beach-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C674&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-27 08:57:26.129942

They’re still waiting,Alejandra Reyes-Velarde,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2026/01/dtsc-cumulative-hazardous-waste-permit/,A 2015 law required the state Department of Toxic Substances Control to overhaul its permitting process to consider how multiple sources of pollution impacts health.

A 2015 law required the state Department of Toxic Substances Control to overhaul its permitting process to consider how multiple sources of pollution impacts health. Advocates now say the overdue rules aren’t protective enough. 


Residents of Kettleman City live surrounded by pollution.  
Farms spray pesticides on almond and pistachio trees in this farmtown. A composting facility handles human sewage waste nearby. Particulate matter and diesel fumes from heavy freeway traffic fill the air. And the West Coast’s largest hazardous waste landfill is just a few miles away from town.  
“There is a lot of cumulative burden from living next to, not just a landfill, but so many other polluting sources,” said community advocate Miguel Alatorre. When it comes to identifying why residents get sick, it’s impossible to point to any one cause. 
A decade ago, California enacted a law that aimed to better protect people from the cumulative impacts of multiple pollution sources in places like Kettleman City. The law required regulators to include these cumulative impacts when weighing whether to grant a hazardous waste permit. People living near the Kettleman Hills landfill, and others living near hazardous waste facilities, hoped new rules would strengthen their ability to object to major pollution sources. 
But the Department of Toxic Substances Control has released draft regulations seven years late. Asked why it missed the deadline, a spokeswoman for the department said only that regulators needed extra time to incorporate feedback after an earlier attempt to write rules five years ago. 
Critics say the new draft still wouldn’t do enough to protect vulnerable communities. “It’s not enough to ‘consider’ cumulative impacts,” said Angela Johnson Meszaros, an attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice. “Communities want strong guidelines for when a permit should be denied. The draft doesn’t deliver that.” 
Cumulative impact considerations in permitting 
Under the draft regulation, hazardous waste facilities seeking new permits would have to profile the demographics and environmental risks of communities within one mile. 
That includes documenting where people who are vulnerable to pollution live, including the elderly and children; identifying other hazardous waste handlers and businesses holding toxic chemicals; and taking note of transportation corridors, where air pollution is often elevated. 
If the surrounding community ranks in the top 25% in CalEnviroScreen – a state tool that screens communities for environmental harm – then the facility seeking a permit would have to write a more detailed assessment. A state report has found that more than half of hazardous waste facilities are in vulnerable communities like Kettleman City, which ranks in the top 10% of CalEnviroScreen. 
Regulators would review the assessment to decide if a permit should include special conditions, such as limiting facility hours during high wind events or requiring translations when a facility communicates with the public.

But the only basis for denying a permit would be the pollution from the hazardous waste facility itself, not the cumulative pollution impacts in the area. 
In the department’s statement of reasons for pursuing the regulation, officials said the change will benefit communities. 
“The enhanced transparency and consistency will foster greater public confidence in and understanding of DTSC’s permitting program,” the department wrote. “The proposed regulations will also lead to greater protection of public health and safety, and the environment.” 
Advocates and businesses say the rules fall short
A central fight over the new regulation is whether it will actually force the state to deny permits in heavily polluted areas—or just add more paperwork. 
Some advocates believe the original law requires regulators to come up with a clear threshold for when to deny a hazardous waste permit. 
“We need DTSC, in accordance with the law, to tell us what’s the analytical process for identifying how much is too much?” Johnson Meszaros said.  
DTSC spokesperson Alysa Pakkidis said that the law “directs DTSC to consider additional permit criteria, not to create a single threshold for denial.” The department “reviews the entire application when making decisions,” she added. 
In Kettleman City, near where the Kettleman Hills hazardous waste landfill is operating on a continuation of a permit that expired in 2013, neighbors say the regulations wouldn’t improve scrutiny of the landfill. That’s because the town is three miles away, outside the one-mile radius applicants have to study.
“The geographic scope of studies really needs to be expanded in order to make sure that this regulation stays true to the intent” of the law, said Chelsea Tu, an attorney with California Rural Legal Assistance. 
The draft regulation also comes too late for Kettleman City – and other communities where regulators have considered permits in recent years. 
According to DTSC’s website, a final permit for the Kettleman Hills landfill is expected later this year. A spokeswoman for the department says that, because the regulation is not final, it cannot apply to that project.

The draft regulation also comes too late for permitting decisions at other major hazardous waste facilities located near homes, including two in Los Angeles County: Phibro-Tech, a toxic waste recycler next to Los Nietos, and Ecobat, a lead-battery recycling facility east of Los Angeles. 
Phibro-Tech’s permit was renewed in February, despite dozens of violations. Ecobat operated on a continuation of a permit that expired in 2015 for 10 more years before DTSC renewed it in November, the same day the department published its draft regulations.
Environmental and community groups are appealing both permits. 
Critics also raise questions about the regulation’s reliance on air quality status and CalEnviroScreen to determine community vulnerability. Some researchers have concluded that the tool is flawed because it is highly subjective and underrepresents some disadvantaged communities, like foreign-born populations.  
“It’s a very blunt instrument for really understanding all the sources of contamination that we experience on a daily basis,” said Rebecca Overmyer-Velázquez, a coordinator for the Clean Air Coalition of North Whittier and Avocado Heights. 
Much of the CalEnviroScreen data comes from polluters themselves, she said. That self-reported data can be out of date, especially for smaller businesses with less rigorous permits.
“There’s so many smaller sources of pollution – but many more of them, in our communities – that don’t get counted, like plating shops and auto body shops,” Overmyer-Velázquez said. 
Officials with the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, the state agency that maintains CalEnviroScreen, said the CalEnviroScreen tool is under review for an update.  
The draft permitting rules would trigger a review process—and possible permit denial—when a facility increases a region’s cancer risk beyond a certain threshold. But Johnson Meszaros of Earthjustice is skeptical about how often that would result in action. 
“All the regulation says is that they shall initiate the process,” Johnson Meszaros said. 
Trade groups representing the waste industry say they’re concerned that the state will deny a facility’s permit because of pollution caused somewhere else.
Local zoning laws allow people like children and seniors to live in areas next to waste facilities, says Dawn Koepke, a lobbyist who represents the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance. 
The draft regulation, she said, “doesn’t do anything to resolve those decisions being made.” 
California’s hazardous waste facilities have declined from more than 400 with permits to fewer than 100 still operating. Koepke says companies are concerned that the new regulation could strain the state’s hazardous waste system. “We’ve had a decline in facilities to help manage the waste we generate in the state…All of that has added costs.” 
A cornerstone of environmental justice advocacy 
The present regulatory fight over how to strengthen scrutiny for permits in places like Kettleman City was shaped in part a decade ago, by an environmental crisis that unfolded 150 miles south near Los Angeles.
Regulators determined that Exide Technologies was contaminating soil with lead and arsenic near thousands of homes over decades. The lead battery recycling plant  operated with only a temporary permit for more than 30 years. 
State officials documented more than 100 violations at the plant and allowed it to continue to operate. When federal authorities threatened criminal charges, the company signed a settlement and agreed to shut its doors. Exide declared bankruptcy in 2020, and the company abandoned the property for good.

The crisis exposed flaws in DTSC’s permitting process and prompted state leaders to promise reform. 
Then-Assemblymember Ricardo Lara introduced legislation, Senate Bill 673, as an explicit response to the problems revealed Exide. 
“SB 673 will create a conduit between DTSC and vulnerable communities across California that are impacted by hazardous waste facilities,” Lara said at the time, according to the legislative analysis documents. “This bill provides important accountability, transparency, and oversight measures that will improve the relationship between DTSC and the communities it is mandated to protect.” 
In 2018, DTSC began carrying out the law by using new rules to score violations from hazardous waste facilities. The department has one last task under the law: finalizing the permitting updates. 
Scientific research backs up community concerns that pollutants add up in the body and worsen health impacts, said Lara Cushing, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at UCLA. 
“We can’t consider each pollution source in isolation, because we know communities are disproportionately exposed to multiple different types of contaminants at the same time, and they can accumulate,” Cushing said. “Chemicals can interact with each other in the body, and none of that’s considered in the current rulemaking.” 
Advocates, like Alatorre in Kettleman City, have long sought regulations to acknowledge that.Between 2007 and 2009, 11 babies were born with birth defects in Kettleman City, a town of just about 1,000 residents. Alatorre, a lifelong environmental justice advocate, says the town still has no explanation for the anomaly.

But the residents suspected the reason came from the combination of pollutants swirling in their air, water and soil. 
“We have no idea what caused those birth defect clusters,” Alatorre said. “It could have been the dump. It could have been the pesticides, something in the soil, or something totally different.” 
A history of broken trust 
After waiting for almost a decade, environmental justice advocates were disappointed when regulations finally came. DTSC published its draft proposal just days before Thanksgiving, then gave the public just 45 days to comment – most of it over the Christmas and New Year’s holiday. 
“It’s kind of a shame that after 10 years DTSC is trying to rush to finish the regulation while making it very convoluted, unnecessarily complicated and not protective enough,” said attorney Chelsea Tu. 
After an outcry from advocates and a letter from state Sens. María Elena Durazo, Lena Gonzalez and Caroline Menjivar, DTSC extended the public comment deadline to Feb. 3 The department will host another public hearing the same day. 
“We truly value the communities we serve and strive to strengthen our partnerships with community members to ensure all Californians are protected,” said department director Katherine M. Butler in a letter to Earthjustice. “DTSC remains committed to strong public engagement.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/011326-Waste-Management-LV-CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-27 08:57:26.129942

(Will Ruzanski/Utah News Dispatch)Hundreds of Utahns gathered at the Capitol steps Monday afternoon — many holding signs, maneuvering wheelchairs, or pushing strollers — to celebrate Disability Advocacy Day, an annual event organized by the Utah Parent Center. After marching through the Capitol plaza, Utahns with disabilities and advocates alike rallied, urging lawmakers to reconsider potential cuts to vital disability support programs. 
The demonstration comes as Utah’s Legislature looks to make budget cuts amid federal funding uncertainty and Medicaid reductions from President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Advocates warn that Utah’s proposed 5-10% funding reductions would disrupt important disability services, negatively affecting thousands of people across the state.
‘Lives are at stake,’ health, food aid advocates say of Medicaid, SNAP cuts in ‘big, beautiful bill’

“Some of the cuts on the table include a proposed 10% cut to DSPD waivers, which are Medicaid programs that essentially allow people to live in the community, in their homes,” said Nate Crippes, the public affairs supervising attorney with the Disability Law Center. 
“A 10% cut would really be a devastating thing to the system, where you’d see providers struggle to make it, you’d see people lose access to services that help them stay in their homes, live with their families, in the community, in their own apartment, things of that nature,” he said. “That would be pretty devastating to people with intellectual developmental disabilities and people who are aging.”
Joey Hanna, executive director of the Utah Parent Center, said the disability “service system is already really stretched,” emphasizing that funding cuts could increase backlogs and lead to closures.
“This is a system where it’s already really hard to get and keep quality employees for our most vulnerable population,” she said. “A 10% cut on top of that would see some really reliable, excellent providers close their doors and go out of business.”
The rally
Discussing the event’s turnout, Hanna pressed the importance for advocates, especially younger Utahns, to “have their voices heard and exercise their civil duties.”
“This is a community that already deals with having to jump through so many hoops, having to be bottom-of-the-barrel feeders when it comes to a lot of different services and different things,” she said. “I think when you threaten to take away even more or make additional barriers, it really gets people riled up.”

Rep. John Arthur, D-Holladay, was among the legislators who attended the rally. While speaking with Utah News Dispatch, he said “if anything, this is a program that needs more funding, not less.”
Outside of the Legislature, Arthur is a sixth grade teacher. He cited his experience with disabled students in the Salt Lake City School District. 
“These are the kids who need the most help and funding for their education,” Arthur said. “It’s more expensive, and unfortunately, it’s also more necessary. Without it, they can’t have access to an education, and I’ve watched kids try to make do with less over the years. … These folks are making it clear that if you do (reduce funding), their lives are going to be horribly affected.”
Response from legislators

Several legislators spoke with Utah News Dispatch about the proposed budget reductions, emphasizing uncertainty for what the final cuts will look like. 
“Every budget committee in the legislature was asked to look at at least 5% cuts,” said Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross. He emphasized that “no decisions have been made” and budget requirements are still in the air. 
“We may get to a point where they say, ‘we asked you for 5% (reduction but) we actually only need to do 2 or 3%,’” he said. “They might say, ‘we asked you for 5%, we need 10%.’ So, I mean, I’ll know a lot more in a month than I know now.”
Rep. Jen Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, echoed Weiler’s uncertainty. 
“I don’t want people to think that coming up with this list of a 5% cut necessarily means that we’re going to cut all these things,” she said. “I’m hoping when the time comes, we’ll find that our financial situation is better than we hoped, and that the cuts that may or may not be recommended would be less necessary.”

Utah’s Legislature is making widespread budget cuts after congressional Republicans’ “Big Beautiful Bill” reduced federal funding for programs like Medicaid, placing financial burden on the states. 
“In the Big Beautiful Bill, they decided in order to fund some of their tax cuts, they were going to put money that they normally spent and funded, that we didn’t, onto the states,” said Rep. Christine Watkins, R-Price. 
“It’s going to take us time to make those adjustments, because it’s not going to change,” she added. “It’s going to happen next year too, we will not get that federal funding so we have to make those adjustments.”
Weiler agreed that the federal legislation forces Utah to reduce its budget, saying the state will collect “$300 million less in income tax this year than we would have.”
“I do think it’s a wise principle for a state government to constantly be asking if there is some fat that we could cut,” he said. “I don’t agree that the fat that should be cut relates to people with disabilities, because they need services.”

Both Republican legislators emphasized the importance of a careful review process before making cuts. 
“We’re just getting started in that process, and we’re going to be asking a lot of questions and looking out for people who need that extra help,” Watkins said. 
Weiler echoed Watkins’ sentiment, encouraging constituents to “make your voices heard.”
“Don’t give up, not all is lost,” Weiler said. “We’ll probably land in a good place, but stay tuned because there’s a lot of moving parts.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah lawmakers advanced a proposal Monday that would require voters to prove they are U.S. citizens if election officers lack confirmation and get in touch seeking documentation. 
Utah’s chief elections officer, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, said last week that an ongoing inquiry by her office has not confirmed any cases of noncitizens voting in a Utah election. One noncitizen voter registration was found in the review.
‘Not a widespread problem’: Lt. gov. releases early findings from voter citizenship review 

A prior review found four people without citizenship managed to register to vote in 2018 or 2019 due to a glitch on a state website. Her office said it’s not clear whether they voted and local prosecutors are investigating. 
Bill sponsor Rep. Cory Maloy, R-Lehi, told colleagues on the House floor Monday that if even a few noncitizens make their way onto Utah’s voter rolls, “that’s a few too many.” 
“This bill helps protect the meaning of citizenship,” Maloy said. 
The House approved HB209 in a 62-13 vote, sending it to the Senate for approval. 
Critics say the move isn’t needed and could pile greater administrative and financial burdens onto county election offices. They note voters already must attest they are U.S. citizens. 
Rep. Sahara Hayes, D-Millcreek, said during the House debate that she’s not opposed to the concept behind the measure.

“But as the recent audit pointed out, this isn’t really an issue that needs solving here in Utah,” Hayes said. “We only had one noncitizen on our voting rolls and they did not vote.” 
The bill sets a process for election officers to investigate a voter’s citizenship status if existing state and federal databases don’t answer the question. For the November general election, the proposal requires elections officers to send notice to voters by July 1 if they need to provide proof of citizenship, then give them 30 days to respond. 
Maloy said Utah doesn’t have authority over federal elections, so voters could cast their ballots in federal races even if his proposal becomes law and they don’t comply with verifying their citizenship. 
Rep. Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City, questioned whether the bill would allow any elected official in Utah, not just those overseeing elections, to determine who can and can’t vote. Maloy said only those in charge of running elections could do so.

A message seeking comment from Tuberville’s campaign was left Monday afternoon.
Tuberville has long faced questions about his residency in the state. Tuberville moved to Alabama in 1999 when he started coaching football for Auburn University. He told Alabama Daily News last summer that time contributed to his residency qualification, and has said a homestead exemption claimed on property in Auburn by his wife and son in 2018 is proof of residence.  al.com reported in May of last year that Tuberville and his wife voted in Florida in 2018, after the homestead exemption was claimed.
The Alabama Constitution requires candidates for governor and lieutenant governor to be residents of the state for at least seven years.
“The governor and lieutenant governor shall each be at least thirty years of age when elected, and shall have been citizens of the United States ten years and resident citizens of this state at least seven years next before the date of their election,” the Constitution reads.

McFeeters said Monday he has reimbursement records from Tuberville’s trips from D.C. to “home,” which were often to the Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport, not Auburn or the surrounding area.
“If you look at the reimbursements that Tuberville has filed to the federal government when he gets reimbursed for travel expenses, none of them are to Auburn. Only a couple of flights go to Alabama, but none of them are to Auburn,” McFeeters said. “He’s got a lot of expenses heading down to the Destin airport and taxi expenses to take him to his home in Santa Rosa.”
Jeannie Burniston, communications director for the Alabama GOP, said in an interview Monday afternoon that a candidate’s qualification would only be removed if compelling legal evidence was provided.
“It would have to be something that would meet a legal threshold, proving that that he’s not a resident and that does not meet the requirements as outlined in the in the state constitution,” Burniston said.
Susan Hamill, a law professor at the University of Alabama, said in a statement Monday afternoon that while the language of the state constitution is vague, Alabama’s history and culture supports a consecutive seven-year residency minimum.
“In my opinion, the spirit of the constitution, especially given Alabama’s history and culture, supports an argument that the seven years residency requirement should be consecutive,” she wrote. “Alabama’s culture is suspicious of outsiders and historically most of Alabama’s governors were born and raised in the state, often having descended from generations of Alabamians.”
Hamill also suggested that the McFeeters campaign investigate all other gubernatorial candidates and challenge Tuberville’s residency in court.
“For political reasons (Tuberville has Trump’s support), I would be surprised if the Republican party responded in McFeeters’ favor by declaring Tuberville ineligible,” she wrote.
McFeeters, however, understands the state constitution to mean the candidate must live in the state for seven consecutive years.
“There’s big questions on his residency, and there’s two ways of looking at it,” he said. “If you look at the courts, they’re saying it’s got to be seven years continuous right up to election. I’ve been told by the Alabama Republican Party, though, that they may look at total time.”
Burniston said that any candidate challenged by Friday at 5 p.m. will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the party’s candidate committee. There will be a hearing for the accused candidate and the accuser to make their cases before the party has to submit its finalized list of candidates to the Alabama Secretary of State on Feb. 26, Burniston said.
“It’s like a watchdog where we’re making sure that we’re dotting our I’s and crossing our T’s, and that everybody meets the threshold of what it takes to be any elected official,” Burniston said. “Whether it’s U.S. Senate and Governor, down to coroner. We want to make sure that everybody is indeed supposed to be a candidate that has filed to be a candidate.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Tommy-Tuberville-02-Aug-4-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 08:57:26.129942

(Photo: Nevada Division of Minerals/Jon Price, 1990)The Trump administration is aggressively moving to expand oil and gas production on public lands across the U.S., an effort that tripled the amount of acres leased last year and resulted in nearly $15 billion in payments to the federal government and states – the fifth-largest disbursement of funds since 1982.
However, higher volumes of oil and gas leasing on public lands last year may not result in better returns for taxpayers in the long-term, according to an analysis by Taxpayers for Common Sense. 
In July 2025, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act which lowered royalty rates for oil and gas leases and reinstated noncompetitive leasing, allowing companies to bypass competitive auctions and acquire acres at lower prices.
By the end of last year, the Bureau of Land Management leased 327,000 acres to oil and gas companies — four times as many as in 2024 — but revenue per acre fell by roughly 50%.
The analysis found that lease sales under the Biden administration had higher average bids than those under the Trump administration, said Tyler Work, a policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense.
“Sales initiated under the Biden administration had a slightly higher average bid of about $1,800 per acre, and the sales initiated under the current administration had an average per acre bid of about $900,” Work said.
Nearly three-fourths of the acres leased for oil and gas production nationally were also sold at a reduced royalty rate of 12.5% on the value of minerals produced on the land, compared to the 16.67% rate established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
According to an analysis by Taxpayers for Common Sense, the leases sold at the new reduced royalty rate are expected to cut federal and state revenue from oil and gas leasing by an estimated $489 million based on projected production.
“We estimate that the 244,000 acres leased for oil and gas development this year at the lower royalty rate of 12.5% could produce $12 billion worth of oil and gas over their lifetime, which will cost taxpayers $489 million in forgone royalties compared to what would have been generated under the previous 16.67% royalty rate,” Work said.
It remains to be seen whether lower royalty rates will impact leasing in Nevada, which has drawn little interest from the industry historically. Only about 6% of leased federal land in Nevada is currently producing oil or gas. 
It’s not uncommon for large swaths of nominated land to never get a bid. For example, in June 2025 the Bureau of Land Management offered five oil and gas parcels in Nevada totaling 6,800 acres, but  none of the parcels received a single bid. Those same parcels also failed to attract any industry interest in 2023 and 2024.
However, Nevada did receive bids on nearly 20,000 acres of oil and gas parcels in March 2025 at about $10 an acre – the legal minimum – generating nearly $300,000 in bid revenue. Those parcels were sold under the higher royalty rate of 16.67% before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed.
The first competitive sale of oil and gas parcels in Nevada under policy changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will be in March 2026, when about 20,000 acres will be put up for auction.
Although oil and gas production in Nevada is minimal, in 2025, Nevada received nearly $12 million in onshore oil and natural gas leasing revenues, the largest disbursement since 2010, according to data from the Office of Natural Resources Revenue.
Melissa Simpson, president of the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas industry organization, pointed to Nevada’s robust revenue last year as an example of oil and gas leasing sales supporting local economies. Simpson emphasized that the Department of the Intrior dispursed nearly $15 billion in oil and natural gas revenues to states and tribes in 2025 from lease sales.
“This is good news for Nevada residents and specifically for local schools. Federal law requires that half of the leasing sales revenues be returned to the state, and Nevada in turn mandates that a significant portion is directed to local schools,” Simpson said. 
Work with the Taxpayers for Common Sense said a major point in their analysis was that royalty rates did not significantly impact industry interest in parcels. 
States with high oil and gas production, like New Mexico, remained competitive, while states with low production, like Nevada, continued to attract minimal bids regardless of royalty rates. Lower rates did not create new demand, said Work, but they did reduce what taxpayers receive when demand already exists.
New Mexico, the top federal oil producer and second-largest gas producer over the last decade, was highly competitive in 2025 before and after the royalty rate was lowered, with 97% of acres receiving a bid at about $8,580 per acre – the highest in the country.
The average bid per acre last year was however less than half the state’s average bid in 2024 and one third its average in 2023—the two years when the higher rate of 16.67% was charged.
“We see that bidding patterns and industry interest did not deviate significantly between, you know, before and after the two royalty rate changes,” Work said. “A higher royalty rate doesn’t make high potential parcels less competitive, and lower royalty rate doesn’t make low potential parcels more competitive.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PumpJackInPineValley-1024x671.jpg,,,2026-01-27 08:57:26.129942

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)When a Danish pension fund recently announced it would sell its $100 million holding of U.S. government bonds, the move was tiny in financial terms – just a drop in a $30 trillion ocean. But it touched on a much bigger issue. Foreign investors now hold around one-third of all U.S. government debt, amounting to roughly $9.5 trillion.
Of these foreign holdings, Europe has $3.6 trillion, making it collectively the largest holder of U.S. debt, larger than Japan (which holds $1.2 trillion) or China (which owns around $700 billion).
Could this financial exposure be turned into political leverage – a way for Europe to push back against Donald Trump’s recent threats over Greenland and European sovereignty? Or, as the U.S. president has claimed, does the U.S. still “hold all the cards” in debt markets?
At the World Economic Forum in Davos recently, Trump threatened a “big retaliation” if European countries sold U.S. assets as a response to tariff threats. When politicians talk about Europe “dumping” U.S. government debt, it sounds like a simple, almost mechanical, act whereby political leaders make a decision and trillions of dollars’ worth of bonds are sold. But that’s not how financial markets actually work.
In Europe, U.S. government bonds aren’t owned by governments. They’re held by pension funds, insurance companies, banks and investment funds. These are independent financial institutions that manage the savings of millions of ordinary people. There is no single switch a government can flip to make all of these investors sell at once, even if it wanted to.
Even if governments are able to cajole European investors into selling their U.S. Treasuries, there is the tricky question of where the money would go. The U.S. Treasury market is the largest bond market in the world. There is no easy alternative home for the $3 trillion of U.S. government bonds held by Europeans.
The euro area does have a large amount of government bonds and in principle they could absorb some reallocation. But shifting even a few trillion dollars at speed would drive prices sharply higher and yields sharply lower, creating enormous distortions.
Then there’s the problem of self-harm. European banks, insurers and pension funds are packed with U.S. Treasuries. A forced or panicked sell-off would punch a hole in their own balance sheets as price fell sharply.
At the same time, if European institutions collectively opt to move all their investments out of dollars into euros the financial market shockwaves would be massive. The surge in demand would likely drive the euro sharply higher, making European exports more expensive and quite possibly tipping the economy into recession.
This is one reason China, despite years of tough talk, never actually followed through on threats to weaponise its Treasury holdings. In modern finance, trying to use these assets as a blunt political weapon tends to look a lot like mutually assured economic damage.
 Why the bond market still has a vote

So does this mean Trump really does hold all the cards? Not quite. While European governments are highly unlikely to try to weaponize their holdings of U.S. government debt, that does not mean the United States is free to ignore international investors.
America is now heavily reliant on global capital markets to fund its large, and growing, budget deficits. Every year, the U.S. government needs to persuade investors, at home and abroad, to buy vast quantities of new Treasury bonds. That normally happens quietly and routinely, on the assumption that the U.S. remains a predictable and reliable steward of the world’s financial system.
But that assumption is precisely what Trump’s broader political project puts at risk. Efforts to rewrite the rules of international trade, to pressure allies or to treat economic relationships as instruments of coercion all increase uncertainty about how the U.S. will behave in the future. Financial markets are often patient, but they are not indifferent to this kind of uncertainty.
If international investors became less willing to hold U.S. government debt then bond prices would fall, yields would rise and the cost of financing America’s government debt would increase. That would feed through into higher borrowing costs across the entire U.S. economy, from mortgages to business loans to government spending itself.
This kind of adjustment would not happen overnight but it is exactly the sort of slow, grinding financial pressure that even the U.S. cannot avoid. Trump may believe he holds all the cards but, in a debt-dependent world, the bond market still gets a vote.

As demand for hospice grows, workers say staffing and pay must keep pace.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Briana Kohlbrenner: End-of-life care is under threat.","This commentary is by Briana Kohlbrenner, a volunteer coordinator with University of Vermont Home Health and Hospice and a member of the Hospice United union bargaining team. 



University of Vermont Home Health and Hospice (UVMHHH) is at a crossroads. As Vermont’s population ages, the demand for hospice care is growing. 
We encourage community members to access hospice services early, as it allows patients and their families more time to focus on individualized goals and be supported by an interdisciplinary team. It also reduces hospitalizations and enables better pain management.

However, we need to have an honest conversation about growth. Expanded hospice services benefit both our health care system and the community we serve, but as a volunteer coordinator with UVMHHH, I see the strain it puts on our organization. 
This is why my colleagues and I voted this past June to form our union, Hospice United, which reflects the unique interdisciplinary nature of hospice. 
We are nurses, social workers, chaplains, volunteer coordinators, bereavement coordinators, kitchen staff and administrative staff. This holistic, wrap-around approach is one of the things that makes hospice care so special. 
Our organization has a deeply committed staff who value providing excellent, around-the-clock care. UVM Health can ensure that quality end-of-life care continues to be core to our mission — or it can allow our program to succumb to the pressures of the health care industry and permit unmitigated growth to drive policy. 
Hospice care is often an afterthought in the broader discussion of health care. It’s time for UVM Health to recognize the crucial role of hospice, and agree to a first contract that will lay the foundation for equitable and sustainable growth for our staff members and community. 
We are asking for fair and transparent pay scales, safe staffing and equity within the UVM Health system. Though we wear the same logo on our badges, we are paid less than our counterparts in other parts of the UVM Health system. A new nurse starting at UVM Home Health and Hospice earns $6.72 less per hour than a new nurse at the UVM Medical Center. 
Furthermore, UVM Home Health and Hospice isn’t competitive with other hospice care in the state. The posted starting rate for a volunteer coordinator with UVMHHH is $20.84 an hour. At Bayada Hospice, also in our county, the volunteer coordinator is posted at $33 an hour — 65% higher. 
I have been with this team for a year and a half now, and during that time, I have watched the complexity and volume of our work grow exponentially. 
We are seeing a higher volume of patients, with more complex care needs, both at the McClure Miller Respite House and among those receiving hospice services wherever they call home. In the past year, our team has also begun supporting patients in the hospital. 
It is essential that our community can access this form of care, but the growth of hospice services is only sustainable when staff are supported. Our union members are on the front lines, and we know the conditions that are necessary to provide safe and dignified care. 
We have created thoughtful proposals to ensure adequate staffing, including staffing ratios and caseloads for nursing staff, and protections for our family services staff who very often work above and beyond their mandated hours. Management has rejected these improvements. 
Our ability to provide quality care is proportional to the amount of time we can spend with each patient. Without staffing guidelines, we will continue to lose valuable team members and our quality of care will diminish. Our team, our patients and our community deserve better. 
The wage disparity for hospice workers and the issue of safe staffing ratios are the core of our staffing issues. We talk often about recruiting and retaining talented staff in this field, but this challenge is not because people don’t want to do hospice work — they simply cannot afford to. 
When the cost of dedicating yourself to a professional mission is personal or financial instability, the organization suffers. 
Our experiences are a window into the systemic undervaluing of all hospice workers. Dying is a part of life, and end-of-life services are an essential part of health care services — so why should we be viewed differently by the system that serves patients throughout the continuum of care? 
These issues are not going to go away, especially as the need for our services grows. 
We hope our community will support us in our fight for equity, safety and respect, so that we can continue to do the unique and specialized work we love.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)For years, crime victim advocates in Washington have fought for state funding to make up for dwindling federal dollars. 
This year will be no different. 
These advocates are asking for a minimum of $21.4 million to keep their organizations afloat. But Gov. Bob Ferguson’s budget proposal, released last month, included just $12 million as state leaders grapple with another financial shortfall.  
The budget the Legislature passed last year included $20 million for crime victim programs in the first year of Washington’s current two-year budget cycle.
This money helps to fund services like 24-hour hotlines, child forensic interviews, legal advocacy, emergency shelter and additional supports for sexual assault and domestic violence survivors and victims of other crimes.
“We’re not asking for new; we’re not asking for more,” said Kate Garvey, CEO of the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center. “We’re just asking for continuation, like keep us level.”
“This is half of what we need, and we can’t help half the state,” Garvey added.
Washington’s primary funding source for victim services is through the federal Victims of Crime Act State Plan, or VOCA. That money, coming from financial penalties in federal court cases, fluctuates year to year.
But it has plummeted from nearly $75 million in fiscal year 2018 to less than $18 million six years later. It ticked back up slightly in fiscal year 2025 to $29 million, but advocates say this respite isn’t enough and underlines the year-to-year funding uncertainty. 
Organizations rely on state funding to make up the difference to maintain services. But while the state’s backfilling has remained steady for several years, it hasn’t kept up with cost increases, said Sherrie Tinoco, public policy director at the Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence. 
In Washington, the money funds 140 organizations, including nonprofits, local governments and tribes, and allows over 50,000 victims to receive services each year. 
“These funding gaps are real services that survivors are no longer going to receive,” Garvey said. “We’re worried.”
For the sexual assault resource center in King County, that could mean longer waits for help, fewer services and less work on preventing these crimes in the first place. 
At the state’s children’s advocacy centers, which mostly get their funding through these federal and state dollars, it has already meant layoffs, said Paula Reed, executive director of Children’s Advocacy Centers of Washington.
The advocacy center in Spokane, for example, had to cut its medical services by 40%, leaving children to potentially need to go to the emergency room instead, Reed said.
“Which is a horrible place for a child to have to go and wait, let alone a parent who is trying to get help for the child who’s experienced something really traumatic,” she added. “We are sort of at this crisis point where children who are abused are going to have less access to the care that they need.”
Similar cuts have been seen at some domestic violence programs, Tinoco said.
“For each advocate that an organization lays off or doesn’t fill a vacant position, that’s a whole caseload of individuals,” she said. “That’s people that, when they call, there is no longer the ability to serve them.”
State lawmakers have floated ideas to stabilize crime victim funding. One proposal from Sen. Manka Dhingra, D-Redmond, would ensure the fund has $50 million annually through 2029 and then rise from there, but the state’s budget woes have doomed that idea.
“They are in one of the worst situations that they have been in a very, very long time,” Dhingra said, noting she was disappointed not to see the requested $21 million in the governor’s budget.
She believes not providing more funding perpetuates the sense “that no one believes survivors, no one is interested in helping them.”
Rep. Lauren Davis, D-Shoreline, is proposing increasing state court financial penalties to help pay for victim services. The legislation, House Bill 2457, had a hearing Monday in a state House committee.
Democrats in the House and Senate will release their own budget proposals in February before agreeing on a spending plan to send to Ferguson’s desk in March. The 60-day legislative session ends March 12.
Crime victim advocates will be in Olympia on Tuesday to advocate for full funding.
The Trump administration has thrown another obstacle in their way. The federal government last year looked to tie crime victim funding for states to their compliance with immigration directives. But Washington and other states have clashed with the administration over those policies.
Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, along with 19 other states, sued to stop the Trump administration from withholding the funding. That case is ongoing.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1597-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 07:57:51.283463

Malinowski leads fundraising in special House race,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2026/01/27/malinowski-special-house-race/,"Eleven Democrats are running in a special election to succeed Gov. Mikie Sherrill in the House. The primary is Thursday, Feb. 5.","Ex-Rep. Tom Malinowski is leading the fundraising race in the 11-person Democratic race to succeed Gov. Mikie Sherrill in the House. The primary is Thursday, Feb. 5. (Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Former Rep. Tom Malinowski edged out Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill to lead fundraising in the 11-way race for the Democratic nod to fill Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s House seat, according to new campaign finance disclosures.
Malinowski, who left office after losing a reelection bid in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District in 2022, brought in nearly $1.2 million through Jan. 23 for his bid to win the 11th District, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.
“I’m not surprised that Malinowski has done well, given the fact that he was an incumbent member of Congress and has done this before and knows how to do this. It’s like muscle memory for him,” said Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics.

The fundraising figures put Malinowski far ahead of most other challengers seeking the Democratic nomination in the special primary, though his cash lead over Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill was narrower.
Gill, who managed former Gov. Phil Murphy’s 2017 campaign, raised $969,103 through Jan. 23, though that figure includes $300,000 in loans from the candidate’s own pocket.
Malinowski had $404,197 banked at the end of the preelection reporting period on Jan. 15, to Gill’s $346,995.
Early in-person voting for the special primary begins Thursday and runs through Feb. 3. The primary is on Thursday, Feb. 5.
The 11th District includes towns in Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties. Before becoming governor last week, Sherrill represented the district since 2019.

A total of 12 candidates are seeking their party’s nod to run in the special election on Thursday, April 16. Eleven Democrats are running and just one Republican, Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway. The winner of the April 16 election will fill the vacancy left when Sherrill resigned from the House to become governor.
Candidates in the special election must file a preelection disclosure with the Federal Election Commission that details fundraising and spending through Jan. 16.
Between then and primary day, they must file notices detailing some contributions within 48 hours of their receipt. They are not obligated to report additional spending until after the primary.
Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett reported raising $472,023 over the reporting period. He also had $166,271 left over in his account from an abandoned 2018 congressional bid. He ended the reporting period with $260,855 banked.
Former Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way, who was a Passaic County Commissioner before becoming Murphy’s secretary of state, reported raising $515,341 through Jan. 23.
She reported having $85,363 banked on Jan. 16, but that number may have swelled since. She reported receiving $110,800 in donations on Jan. 22 and 23, according to 48-hour notices filed with the commission.
Way has other money boosting her bid. The Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association has said it spent $1.4 million on television ads and mailers boosting Way. Separately, Article One Inc. PAC has put $350,000 behind digital ads touting the former lieutenant governor, according to FEC filings.
“I think it propels her out of that pack of $400,000 because she’s the only one at that level who has anywhere close to a million-and-a-half dollars being spent on her behalf,” Rasmussen said.
The 218 Project, a PAC formed to boost Malinowski, has spent at least $407,000 boosting the former congressman’s bid, according to Federal Election Commission filings. But the United Democracy Project, a pro-Israel super PAC, has reported spending $818,449 against his bid.
Analilia Mejia, who has won endorsements from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and other progressive leaders like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, reported raising $421,218. She spent little and had $358,121 banked at the end of the reporting period.
Because Sanders’ appearance at a Jan. 19 rally in support of Mejia came days after the end of the reporting period, donations it caused would not be reflected in Mejia’s filings. But the rally does not appear to have spurred many large donations to her. She reported a single $1,000 donation through 48-hour notices, which only capture contributions that are worth at least $1,000.
“For all the strong progressive endorsements she’s got, that has not translated into a more solid war chest, and it really, I think, is constraining her ability to communicate those endorsements,” Rasmussen said.
Morris Township Deputy Mayor Jeff Grayzel brought in $459,674, and former Obama White House staffer Cammie Croft raised $372,318. Attorney J-L Cauvin and Trump impersonator reported raising exactly $100,000, and Anna Lee Williams, a community advocate who was the first Democrat to enter the race, said she raised $26,422.
Chatham Councilman Justin Strickland had no financial disclosures listed.
Hathaway, the sole Republican in the race, brought in $260,813 through Jan. 15.

Kenneth Paschal, R-Pelham, speaks to a staffer on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives on Feb. 13, 2024 in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives Thursday passed a bill that would allow retirees to work full-time as bus drivers if certain stipulations are met.
HB 138, sponsored by Kenneth Paschal, R-Pelham, would allow state retirees to return to work as full time bus drivers while continuing to receive retirement benefits.
“It’s a bill to address the bus drivers’ shortage that we have throughout the state of Alabama,” Paschal said on the House Floor. “It has a sunset of 2030. That’ll give us an opportunity to come back to assessment and reevaluation.”

Under the bill, anyone who is retired under the Employees’ Retirement System or the Teachers’ Retirement System will be allowed to return to work with employers who participate in either system while still maintaining their retirement benefits if they have drawn retirement benefits for 12 consecutive months and if compensation doesn’t exceed $30,000.
Ryan Hollingsworth, executive director of School Superintendents of Alabama (SSA), said in an interview Monday that the bus driver shortage has been an issue for several years.
“I’ve been in Montgomery now eight years in this role, and the bus driver shortage has been there for almost the entire time,” he said. “So if they are yelling a little louder, ‘Hey, we really need bus drivers.’ I just hear ‘bus driver shortage,’ and that’s been consistent.”
The bill passed the House 103-0.
“Bus driver shortage is a critical issue all across the state, transportation is a big issue, and this is a great solution for that,” House Ways and Means Education Chairman Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, said to Paschal during debate on Thursday
Paschal said the bill originated from one of his constituents who is a retiree and part time bus driver who wanted to do the job full-time but was unable to because of the law.
Hollingsworth said there is a substitute bus driver shortage as well.
“I was in Marion County, and we would have, maybe, in a community where you had elementary and high school and you ran the buses for those two schools. So that in that community, we may only have one substitute bus driver, and so if you had a couple of drivers, especially during the flu season or whatnot, if you had a couple of drivers that had to miss then, then we don’t even have enough bus drivers to cover all the routes,” he said.
Some school systems will hire what they call a “permanent substitute driver,” or a bus driver who is hired on by the school system full-time to drive for multiple school routes.
Nationally, the bus driver shortage has gotten better, but only marginally. According to a recent study from the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank, the number of bus drivers increased by roughly 2,300 (1.1%) from 2024 to 2025, it’s still down 9.5% from 2019.
Hollingsworth said this bill could help with both shortages.
“I think Rep. Paschal heard his communities that he represents, that’s been an issue that we’ve been talking about, he always comes to our district legislative meetings. We have one a year in district five that he’s located, and he responded to that,” Hollingsworth said.
The bill moves to the Senate. If passed, the bill would go into effect Oct. 1.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Kenneth-Paschal-Feb-13-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 07:57:51.283463

But farm representatives worry that the change would burden an already struggling industry.
Senate Bill 6045 had its first hearing on Jan. 20 in the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee, which is chaired by the bill’s prime sponsor, Sen. Rebecca Saldana, D-Seattle.
The federal National Labor Relations Act, which grants collective bargaining rights to private-sector workers, does not cover agricultural workers. In Washington, agricultural workers can unionize, but the bill’s advocates point out that the law does not have a mechanism to enforce that ability.
SB 6045 would put agricultural workers’ collective bargaining under the purview of the state Public Employment Relations Commission, which already covers agricultural cannabis workers. The state commission, along with the courts, would enforce workers’ rights associated with forming a union, including certifying the union and establishing a contract, according to the bill summary.
 Impassioned support

April Sims, president of the Washington State Labor Council, AFL-CIO, who testified in support of the bill, said the federal act left out agricultural work — “work historically performed by Black, Mexican or Filipino workers, and a century later that injustice still stands.”
“You have a chance to both empower the farm families who supply our food and to correct this historic injustice,” Sims said.
Andrea Schmitt, an attorney at Columbia Legal Services who supports the bill, said the fact that farmworkers don’t have an enforceable right to union elections, or to ensure their employers recognize those unions, remains a “gaping hole in the law.”
Several people who supported the bill are associated with Familias Unidas por la Justicia, a Washington farmworkers union that was born of strikes, boycotts and years of litigation, according to its political director, Edgar Franks.
He told the committee that such a contentious process “caused economic harm to both the employer and the employee. That’s something that we don’t want.”
SB 6045 “offers a remedy,” he said.
“Predictability, I know, is a big thing for employers and also for workers, so we feel that this bill does that,” he said. “It also offers fairness for workers.”
Tomas Ramon, vice president of FUJ, said through a translator, “Winning a union contract has changed my family’s life for the better in every way.
“We’re tired of hearing the excuse from the agricultural industry that giving farmworkers the same rights as everyone else will run farms out of business. It’s an insult to our humanity.”
 Significant opposition

Of the people who signed into the meeting but did not testify, almost 500 favored the bill, and more than 600 opposed it.
Blaine Smith, an orchardist who opposes the bill, said he spoke for hundreds of small growers in the Wenatchee Valley when he said the agricultural industry faces financial difficulties right now.
“Nobody’s making an income,” he said, “and as much as we would like to pay higher wages, we just simply are broke.”
Enrique Gastelum testified on behalf of the Worker and Farm Labor Association, which opposes SB 6045. He said the bill “adds significant risk at a time when agriculture cannot absorb more.”
“Washington agriculture has been financially strained for years,” he said. “Farm numbers are falling, labor costs have surged, and many operations are hanging on by a thread. When farms close, workers are the first to lose income and the economic impact ripples across the entire community. Any new labor policy must be crafted with this fragile reality in mind.”
Gastelum and other critics share the concern that, by allowing workers to strike, the bill risks the crops that during harvest season must be picked within a narrow timeframe.
Others questioned whether a new law is needed given Washington’s worker protections, including the highest minimum wage among the states, overtime pay, employee safety and statutes against discrimination and retaliation.
Cory Anderson, director of agriculture operations and strategy at L&L Ag Production, asked what problem the bill seeks to solve.
“This bill doesn’t just claim to protect workers,” he said. “It builds a new labor system — a system of mandatory bargaining, lawyers and rigid rules. You don’t improve relationships by turning them into legal processes. … Collective bargaining agreements replace those relationships with paperwork and procedures. You cannot legislate trust, but you can absolutely destroy it.”
Saldana said the way agriculture operates is not working, in part, “because the fundamental way that we’ve structured this industry is based on a history of exploitation, and until we face that, it is causing harm to the farmer and to the farmworker.
“It is why we see a high rate of suicide and mental health challenges for both the producers and also the farmworkers.”
Calling her bill a “starting point” to correct the power imbalance, she said that although it is a short legislative session, “I am optimistic that the people that we have before us right now — the farmers we heard from, the association leaders that we heard from, the union representation we heard from — that we are the right people at the right time to take on a big challenge.”
A companion bill also had a hearing in the state House of Representatives.

In a press release, Ann Arbor Public Power said it would kick off its petition drive on Jan. 31 for an initiative that would require the city to establish a governance structure for a municipal utility – if approved by voters. 
The group aims to collect 6,500 signatures to place the matter on the November ballot. Under the proposed charter amendment, elections for the public utility governing board would be held in 2028.
Ann Arbor currently receives electrical service from DTE Energy, one of the state’s largest energy companies.
“We believe that Ann Arbor is ready to begin the process of replacing DTE,” Ann Arbor Public Power President Sean Higgins said in a statement. “A not-for-profit, democratically governed city utility can reinvest profits into upgrading the local grid instead of enriching shareholders, while keeping rates affordable and developing local renewable energy.”
Higgins criticized DTE for its plans to continue the buildout of fossil fuel plants despite the state’s laws requiring companies to provide energy from 100% clean sources by 2040.
The company has also been subject to frequent criticism due to high energy rates and poor reliability.

In an email, DTE Spokesperson Ryan Lowry argued that the proposal would carry a risk of high-costs, pointing to an analysis it commissioned from Charles River Associates which determined that Ann Arbor residents could see a 30-40% increase in retail energy rates if the city proceeds with the plan, while a takeover of DTE’s assets could cost $1 billion upfront and an additional $1 billion over the next 20 years.
A previous study commissioned by the city found a takeover of DTE’s electrical distribution infrastructure could cost anywhere from $281 million to $1.15 billion, MLive reported.
However, Ann Arbor for Public Power emphasized that the approval of this charter amendment would not authorize the city to take ownership of DTE’s assets in the area, which would require a separate vote. The proposal at hand would only create a governing structure, the group said in a press release, arguing it would cost taxpayers “almost nothing.”
Lowry said “DTE remains focused on continuing to improve reliability, supporting Ann Arbor’s clean energy goals, and keeping bills as low as possible,” telling Michigan Advance that DTE customers in Ann Arbor experienced a nearly 90% improvement in time spent without power between 2023 and 2024, and continued to see significant improvements based on preliminary data from 2025.

Senate Bill 76 passed 37–7, with all “no” votes coming from Democrats. Five senators were excused and did not vote. The bill now heads to the House.
The vote comes as immigration enforcement — particularly actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE — has sparked protests, clashes with law enforcement and heightened political tensions in several states, especially in Minnesota.
The legislation, authored by Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, expands requirements for state and local governments to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, particularly with respect to immigration detainer requests — and it gives Indiana new tools to penalize local entities that fail to comply.
“Senate Bill 76 addresses a serious problem,” Brown said Monday, addressing the chamber. “The Biden administration deliberately created a humanitarian crisis in this country. Because of this, the Trump administration in the course of enforcing our laws has at times asked for state and local cooperation across many sectors. This state has always been on the side of law enforcement, and we’ve had our own policies — such as banning sanctuary city policies — to ensure that law enforcement can do their job.”
What Senate Bill 76 would do
The latest draft of Brown’s bill requires governmental bodies that have custody of an individual subject to an immigration detainer request — such as county jails or local law enforcement agencies holding someone after an arrest — to notify the judge overseeing bail decisions that the individual is subject to an ICE detainer request.

It also requires those agencies to record the detainer in the individual’s case file, comply with the detainer and inform the individual that they are being held pursuant to the request.
Judges who receive notice of a detainer would be required to ensure that notice is recorded in the court’s record.
The bill also directs the Indiana Department of Correction to adopt statewide rules for how county jails must cooperate with ICE. In practice, that would require jails to follow uniform procedures when ICE asks that someone be held for pickup.
Officers who complete department-approved training would be granted an affirmative defense in certain civil actions. The provision is intended to shield law enforcement from legal liability when they follow the state’s required standards for cooperating with ICE.
Senate Bill 76 further allows the governor to withhold grants or state funding from a governmental body for up to a year if it’s found to have violated detainer-related requirements laid out in the legislation. 
It also strengthens prohibitions on state or local entities — including public colleges and universities — limiting or restricting the enforcement of federal immigration law, regardless of whether that enforcement is carried out by federal, state or local agencies, Brown noted.
Other provisions in the bill would tighten enforcement against employers who knowingly hire unauthorized workers; require state agencies to submit immigration-related reports to lawmakers; and expand the state’s ability to pursue “indecent nuisance” actions in cases tied to human trafficking, allowing government entities to recover investigative and court costs.
A similar immigration enforcement bill debated during the 2025 session advanced from the House but ultimately died in the Senate after Brown refused to give it a hearing.
National tensions fuel Statehouse debate
Debate on the Senate floor unfolded against a backdrop of heightened national tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and ICE operations.
Democrats pointed to two recent deaths involving federal agents in Minnesota and urged lawmakers to slow down.
“Two people have died at the hands of ICE agents,” said Sen. Greg Taylor, D-Indianapolis, explaining his no vote. “We have a responsibility as legislators to put forward public policy that protects against those things.”

Legislation criminalizing doxing also advanced from the Senate on Monday, in a unanimous 44-0 vote. Senate Bill 140 defines doxing as posting someone’s personal information on social media with the intent to make them fear bodily injury or property damage — or to spur other people to harm the targeted person or their property. Lawmakers on both sides of President Donald Trump’s failed redistricting push last year found themselves the victim of such threats.

But at least one Republican pushed back. 
“I want you to stop and think for just a minute of how different things would be in Minnesota if that state would simply let the ICE officials into their jails to get the people that have broken our immigration law and that are already in custody,” said Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton. “Think how much easier things would be in Minnesota if political leaders of that state were not inciting an army of citizens who think it’s okay to attack law enforcement.”
Gaskill described incidents in which ICE agents have been targeted and criticized Democratic lawmakers for what he called a “mischaracterization” of immigration enforcement.
“Our immigration laws were passed in Congress by Democrats and Republicans years ago,” he said. “It’s just a matter of, are we going to enforce them, or are we not?”
Democratic senators warned the bill would strain already overcrowded county jails, divert local law enforcement resources and further undermine trust between police and immigrant communities.
“County jails across the state are already full,” said Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington. “Yet, this bill demands more holds, more time in custody and more administrative burden and not taking into account even constitutional rights.”
She described the legislation as “virtue signaling with real and devastating consequences” and argued that local governments would be left to absorb costs and fallout.
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, additionally referenced opposition from Indianapolis law enforcement during similar debates last year.
“The Fraternal Order of Police in Indianapolis had a press conference and they opposed that type of legislation,” Qaddoura noted. “It diverts local resources of law enforcement to enforce federal law, and that will break the trust between law enforcement and our communities.”
Indiana attorney general still opposed
But Brown rejected claims that the bill targets immigrants broadly.
“If you are here legally, this bill doesn’t pertain to you,” Brown maintained. “If you are here legally and you continue to abide by our laws, this bill doesn’t pertain to you.”

She said the bill’s intent is to prevent “rogue units of government or higher ed” from impeding enforcement and to ensure law enforcement has the training it has requested.
“Allow law enforcement to do their jobs, enforce the laws that we have in our books, federal, state or local,” Brown said. “And if you do not, there will be consequences.”
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita — who has previously criticized Brown’s bill — remained sharply skeptical on Monday.
In a statement to the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Rokita called the bill “window dressing,” saying Brown is “desperately trying to dig herself out of a hole with conservatives.”
Although he acknowledged that recent amendments made the bill “marginally better,” Rokita said it remains “toothless” and argued stronger enforcement language is still available.
He said the “FAIRNESS Act” — a controversial, previously unsuccessful federal immigration bill — “is still available and can be put into” the Indiana bill.
“If you want to talk about virtue signaling, using words to describe this bill as aligning with hate and fear,” Brown said in closing, “the underlying pinnings of this bill are to allow law enforcement to do their jobs and enforce the laws that we have on our books.”

It’s a rare opportunity to welcome the world.
But if history is any guide, hosting mega-events brings real challenges alongside the spectacle — not all of them welcome.
One of the more immediate concerns is how cities like ours handle public presentation. In many places, that’s meant aggressive crackdowns on visible homelessness in advance of big events. New Orleans did so for the 2025 Super Bowland a 2024 Taylor Swift concert. Chicago moved homeless encampments for the 2024 Democratic National Conventionand San Francisco did so for a state visit. Internationally, Paris and New Delhi relocated homeless camps for the Olympics and G20, respectively.
Kansas City officials insist the World Cup has not required them to change their approach. Josh Henges, who leads homelessness prevention efforts in the city Housing Department, points to past events like the NFL Draft and Chiefs parades as proof that the city has stuck with their, “strong balanced process that prioritizes public safety while connecting people to services.”
He may be right, but that would make Kansas City an outlier.
What makes this different is scale. The NFL Draft drew large crowds—but not 650,000 people that World Cup promoters claim will descend on the region (There is reason to be skeptical of that number and the supposed economic impact). Public safety preparation is not just about crowd size. It’s also about unpredictability, especially when alcohol is involved.
Earlier this year, Missouri lawmakers approved 23-hour liquor sales statewide for the duration of the tournament. That decision may boost business, but it also raises risk — particularly in the communities that will absorb the largest crowds.
Hooliganism may feel like a foreign problem, but don’t be so sure. The Times of London reported in June that fan violence still plagues international matches. This risk was brought to my attention by an English friend living in Kansas City who will steer clear of wherever English visitors are whooping it up.
Some cities are working to prepare. Dimitrios Mastoras of the Connecticut-based Safe Night LLC told me his firm is helping World Cup hosts like Dallas and New York train bar staff and coordinate safety plans. The idea is to prevent problems before they start. But in Kansas City, officials have often seemed quicker to blame bar owners or liquor stores (and parking lot operators!) for crime than to work with them.
This reactive posture shows up elsewhere, including housing. According to the Kansas City Business Journal, the metro area has just 65,000 hotel rooms. That’s not nearly enough for the expected influx. Short-term rentals will need to fill the gap, but the region’s policies are inconsistent and in some cases contradictory.
In Parkville, city leaders wisely suspended their limits on rentals during the tournament window. But other jurisdictions around Kansas City — Prairie Village, Leawood, Gladstone — still ban short-term rentals altogether. Some require registration. Others have caps. Homeowner associations in many areas prohibit them regardless of city policy.
This patchwork approach — common across Missouri, where housing and tax policy are largely left to local governments — makes planning difficult. The local short-term rental alliance is trying to educate residents, but confusion remains. Jackson County’s recent decision to treat some rentals as commercial property nearly tripled tax bills for hosts. That policy was paused until after the tournament, but the uncertainty hasn’t gone away.
Meanwhile, Kansas City continues to lag on infrastructure and public coordination. Construction delays on temporary jail facilities suggest city and county leaders are racing the clock. And the city’s push to subsidize empty storefronts, rather than addressing longer-term development hurdles, suggests short-term optics still matter more than long-term solutions.
This is a familiar pattern. Local leaders defer key decisions — on safety, housing, infrastructure — until a deadline looms. Then they scramble, spending heavily and blaming others when problems emerge.
The World Cup could still be a moment of civic pride for Missouri. But that will depend less on the crowds we host than on the choices made beforehand. Coordination, clarity, and consistency — not just marketing — will determine whether the state’s largest city, and the state itself, are ready.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kansas-city-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-27 06:57:35.399000

He refused, telling the corrections officer directing him to go outside that he has been enrolled in education programs and is exempt from labor assignments. That is not what the prison records showed, was the response, and he had two options — go to work or go to administrative segregation.
“So they locked me up, cuffed me up, took me down to the hole, stripped me naked and left me there exposed to the elements in a building that is not heated,” Bady said Monday afternoon in an interview with The Independent.
The storm that covered most of Missouri in snow between Saturday morning and Sunday afternoon left approximately 6 inches on the ground at Algoa in Jefferson City. 
While the storm was still underway, prisoner activist Dena Notz, founder of the organization Collectively Changing Corrections, began fielding reports about prisoners being sent out to shovel snow at all hours of the day while small utility vehicles with snow plows and brushes remained idle.
Along with the report about Bady being punished for refusing, Notz fielded reports of people being rousted from their beds at Moberly Correctional Center for three-hour shifts ending at midnight, then being called out again before dawn to do the same job.
“I don’t think they should be able to force me to go out there and shovel snow at midnight, at negative 12 degrees, for hours,” Wesley Hays, who is in custody at the Moberly prison, said in an interview with The Independent. “I can’t argue with them, because I get in trouble, then I get disciplined for something that I don’t think we should be doing anyway.”
The air temperature was below 10 degrees and the wind-chill in central Missouri was minus 10 degrees or lower continuously from Friday morning until Sunday afternoon. 
“The officers have warm clothes to wear, and they have maintenance crews, and it’s like, ‘why are they having these guys go out and do this?’” Notz said in an interview. “I got reports this morning that they finally took the snow equipment out and started using it.”
Prison crews are put to work clearing snow while a storm is underway to keep walkways clear for medical crews and allow people in custody to reach dining halls and work assignments, Missouri Department of Corrections spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said in an email response to inquiries from The Independent.
“We do have UTVs equipped with snow removal gear, and they are used for snow removal, but they might not be appropriate for all walkways — and we don’t have enough of them for everyone involved in snow removal to use them,” Pojmann said.
Every inmate assigned to work on snow removal is provided coveralls, coats, gloves, boots and stocking caps, Pojmann wrote.
Indoor climate conditions at Algoa, a 93-year-old prison, are the subject of a class-action lawsuit filed last summer as temperatures were 100 degrees or higher inside because the prison lacks air conditioning.
The department monitors conditions regularly, Pojmann said,  
“Inside the buildings, temperature checks are conducted in all wings of all housing units twice a day to ensure that indoor temperatures remain at appropriate levels,” she said.
Every person in state custody capable of working must either have a job inside the prison system or attend education programs, Pojmann said. Bady’s records show he is part of the Captain’s Team at Algoa, a work assignment for outdoor maintenance and groundskeeping, Pojmann said. 
“His work assignment is not full-time student; it’s general laborer,” she said.
Each of the state’s 19 adult prisons has a Captain’s Team for those jobs, Pojmann said.
“Each facility has a resident snow crew,” she said. “It’s a paid job.”
Bady, however, said he signed up for the team last summer, then resigned to concentrate on his schooling. 
Bady has been in custody since 2009 and believed he was likely to be released Jan. 10 after serving 85% of a 20-year sentence for robbery. He was told in September he would not be released this month and will be eligible for release in mid-2027.
He said he has not worked on the Captain’s Team since summer and the records of the department are not up-to-date.
“I tried to explain to the officer that I’m a full time student, that is my designated job, and I’m not required to go out and shovel no snow,” Bady said.”And so they were adamant that I was a part of the snow crew on the captain’s crew, and I needed to get out there and work because my name was in the system that’s registered to do this job.”
Kimberly Bady, his wife, said she was on the phone with her husband when he was ordered outside. She overheard him object and began trying to get him returned to his cell. He was in administrative segregation for about five hours.
“When he got out of the hole, they had men out there shoveling,” Kimberly Bady said. “He said, ‘as soon as the guy shoveled it, it would be covered over.’”
Kimberly Bady is a former corrections officer.
“Why are you having inmates who don’t have proper protection get out in a state of emergency, at risk for frostbite,” she said.
The department can’t wait for snow to end to clear walkways, Pojmann said. 
“Sidewalks are cleared and salted regularly to keep them safe for all residents and staff passing through the facility, particularly ahead of the breakfast rush,” she said.

At Moberly, Hays is part of a “work on demand” detail and he knew he could not refuse, he said. The gloves available to prisoners are jersey gloves like those used by gardeners and the boots are not insulated, he said. If an incarcerated person wants warmer clothes than prison-issued garments, they must buy it through the canteen, he said.
The snow was very dry and easy to move with a broom. The broom given to him, Hays said, was broken and the sweeper head would not stay attached to the handle. 
“Every time I had to bend down, pick up the broom, bring it back, and then sweep again,” he said.
The bitter cold was hard on anyone who didn’t have the money for warmer gear and the three-hour shifts were hard to endure, he said.
“They have a four wheel drive out there that could have done one sweep, one swipe could have been done,” he said. “And they have us guys on there with shovels and push brooms for hours doing something that takes that UTV could have done within one hour.”
Missouri has 19 adult prisons and there are facilities that had double the snow that fell at Algoa or Moberly. Madison Englert, Hays’ fiance, said she is a paramedic who has responded in winter on calls to the Crossroads Correctional Center in Cameron.
“Going out there, we have to just push our stretcher through the snow,” she said. “They don’t clear them in the middle of the night.”
The danger of hypothermia or frostbite in the bitter temperatures should have been mitigated by shorter work periods outdoors, Englert said.
The danger of refusing a work assignment is being punished, Pojmann said.
“At any facility,” she wrote, “anyone who fails to report for their regular designated paid work assignment may be found to be in violation of a rule (not being in the area where assigned or directed, for example) and therefore may be issued a conduct violation.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Algoa-Correctional-Center-04022025-1024x614.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 06:57:35.399000

Mike Kehoe speaks briefly at a Sept. 9 meeting of the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force in the Missouri Special Olympics office building in Jefferson City. The task force met via video conference Monday for its first meeting since breaking into working groups (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s method for determining state aid for public schools is poised for substantial change, as a task force drafting the new funding formula began on Monday to synthesize four months of meetings into recommendations.
The group, dubbed the Missouri School Modernization Task Force, met Monday morning for the first time since breaking into smaller cohorts and looked at proposed changes to three parts of the formula.
Without the final components identified, it remains unclear how much the changes may cost.
Gov. Mike Kehoe’s budget proposal for the next fiscal year keeps the formula’s funding flat, declining to include a $190.6 million increase triggered by recent changes to state law.
With current budget discussions centering cuts, and Kehoe’s executive order telling the task force to reduce the formula’s bottom line, its members are keeping close watch on the numbers.
“We really have to be cognizant of the budget times we are in,” said task force member Don Thalhuber, the policy director for Missouri Senate Democrats who helped draft the current formula in 2005. “If the General Assembly can’t fund a $190 million increase… that is a problem that we are going to have to really think about as we craft this.”
The group’s plan follows the current formula’s broad structure, containing three multipliers and a reduction to account for funding districts receive from local property taxes.
One of these factors, called the state adequacy target, would increase from $7,145 to $11,504 under changes the task force is considering.
Rudi ’splains it: The State Adequacy Target

The number itself is just a starting point, with other factors and adjustments impacting the bottom line. The task force’s members did not dwell on the price tag, instead questioning the target’s stability.
The state adequacy target is intended to represent the per-pupil cost of an adequate education and is calculated by looking at how much high-performing school districts are spending per student. These districts are those who score 90% or higher on their annual performance reports.
Prior to 2022, a majority of school districts hit the high-performing mark. But since the state switched to a scoring system education officials deemed “more rigorous,” just 22 districts and one charter school have a three-year composite score above 90%.
The average expenditures of these districts were much higher, driving the formula up $300 million this fiscal year after years of stagnation. Between 2009 and 2024, the state adequacy target grew just 4% while inflation topped 33%.
Seeking to protect the target from large jumps in the future, the task force is proposing to look at the expenditures of the 100 top-scoring school districts.
Kari Monsees, who recently retired as the state education department’s finance chief, told the task force the switch would remove “variability,” though his calculations showed the number was not immune to outside forces.
Applying the group’s recommendations to previous years, there was a 10% jump in the state adequacy target between 2024 and 2025.
Monsees said this is because of “a lot of contributing factors.” He pointed to a push to raise teacher salaries as part of a workforce shortage.
“There are a lot of challenges there,” he said. “But seeing the increase from one calculation to the next has got me thinking that we may have to consider caps or something else within that calculation methodology.”
The group’s proposal more intentionally captures the cost of educating students from low-income families, those requiring accommodations for disabilities and English-language learners by factoring them into this part of the equation.
“It gets more down to the student level in terms of the demographics of a district and the students that they are serving,” Monsees said.
Factoring in the number of students in high-needs groups as part of the state adequacy target allows a shift in the way the formula gives extra funding for these students.
The current formula has thresholds, so only districts with a higher proportion of students in these categories get extra funding. The group wants to eliminate these cutoffs.
In total, this move would count an additional 8,000 low-income students, 35,000 students with disabilities and 2,400 English learners whose districts don’t receive extra funding under the threshold model.
Other changes discussed Monday include a switch to counting students based on enrollment rather than attendance, which was an early goal of the task force despite some members worrying it might have a negative effect on attendance.
The group is scheduled to meet next on Feb. 23 in Jefferson City. The group has until Dec. 1 to craft its recommendations and present them to the governor.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090925_kehoe1-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-27 06:57:35.399000

Outside the small, industrial-looking building off Commerce Road in Franklin, Indiana, a long line of cars waited in the rain to receive their groceries for the week.
Volunteers weaved between vehicles and raindrops, dodging exhaust fumes, to provide drivers with a menu to fill out. The list included protein options, canned, bagged and boxed foods, frozen fruit and soup, milk, eggs, deli meat, snacks, bread and coffee. 
Behind the wheel of her old pickup truck, Angela Nelson circled the choices for her family of nine, stopping at the very last option, a line where she could write her “one wish list item.”
On Nov. 7, she asked for a birthday cake for her son.
At Interchurch Food Pantry of Johnson County, birthday cake is possible because of an intricate system the pantry calls “food rescue.” Rescuing food allows Executive Director Carol Phipps and her team not only to keep Central Indiana residents nourished and fed but also supplied with a little joy in the form of a sweet treat.
This is food pantry resilience, honed over decades of government shutdowns, swings in the economy, fluctuations in donors and funding and volunteers, and changes in federal food support—and in this way, the Interchurch Food Pantry is not unique. 
Food pantries in Indiana and across the country look to local grocers, college students, churches, K-12 schools, restaurants and bakeries for donations of food, or grow their own on rooftop gardens, or spend hours writing grant requests to stay afloat.
Experts say this is how it has to be.
“Any sector you’re in, we are trying to figure out how to piece multiple streams of resources together to meet ever-growing needs,” said Chris Bernard, president and CEO of Hunger Free Oklahoma. “You need an array of resources to rely on because no single one can really meet that total demand. … It helps create stability, rather than up and down chaos, which is much harder to manage when you’re trying to meet basic needs.”
He added that benevolent support can vary depending on the political climate.
“When it’s a hot-button issue, you might have as many volunteers as you can handle and more. But when the public’s attention gets focused somewhere else, you might be struggling,” Bernard said. “The folks who do this, do it well. They understand logistics and they understand how to leverage resources.”
Increasing needs in Indiana
In Indiana, Feeding America reported that one in seven people face hunger. The state as a whole, according to Gleaners, has a 12.6% food insecurity rate, with 299,260 Hoosiers regularly going hungry, according to Gleaners Food Bank. 
In Marion County, the least rural part of the state, SNAP provides half of the meals for people who utilize food benefits according to Indy Hunger Network. On top of that, half of the county’s residents also told Indy Hunger Network they were facing food insecurity in a 2025 survey.
Interchurch Food Pantry of Johnson County, which is located just outside of Marion County, was serving about 1,000 households per week as of September, a 21% increase over last year.

The pantry helps families like Nelson, who visit for groceries and even sweet treats like a birthday cake. 
As demand rises, the pantry has observed a noticeable lull in supply from Gleaners Food Bank, the food bank where Interchurch receives some commodities through The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). 
In 2024, the pantry received 10,000 to 41,000 pounds of food each month from Gleaners. So far this year, it has maxed out at about 20,000 pounds. This is largely because TEFAP and other federal food assistance programs had their funding slashed by President Donald Trump’s administration this year.
Phipps said if government commodities completely went away, the pantry would lose about $500,000 worth of food per year. But she has remained optimistic. She is able to call on her decades-long experiences with food rescue initiatives, which help Interchurch keep up with demand, despite fewer goods from government-backed sources. 
This is exactly how her pantry does it:
Early in the morning, three days each week, two Interchurch volunteers will hop in a van and travel to schools in two central Indiana districts. Some mornings, they will make nearly 20 stops. 
These volunteers, according to Phipps, are strategic. They work with food service coordinators to organize precise pickup times similar to the way buses pick children up for school. 
The van drivers also have memorized routes they take to avoid morning traffic, which helps them stay on time. Phipps said drivers have to be on time because there is often cold or frozen food, like milk and or chicken nuggets, that schools don’t have room to store and need to be transported to the pantry in a timely manner.
While these routes are strategic and precise, pick-ups aren’t executed perfectly every day. Sometimes, a food service coordinator from a school will call Phipps if a driver is later than usual or seems to have missed their stop. Phipps then has to call the driver. In other cases, a school might not have anything for Interchurch to pick up, so the coordinator will contact Phipps, and she will relay to the driver not to stop there that day.
“There’s communication and things that have to happen to make this all work, but believe me, it is well worth it,” Phipps said.

When the vans return to the pantry from their trip, they unload and another team of volunteers does the more tedious work of sorting and repackaging food to make sure it is up to health department standards so it is ready to be distributed. 
By the end of the day, Phipps said over 80% of food rescued from schools is sent to the homes of families who need it. 
Interchurch also rescues food from local grocery stores, which is where birthday cakes, cheesecakes, cupcakes and other sought-after sweets come from. 
Phipps said this type of food rescue takes a little more training for her volunteers.
Instead of driving a van, volunteers take box trucks so that they can transport larger quantities of food. Before a volunteer is able to do the grocery store route, they have to complete box truck training, which ensures they are able to back the truck into a loading dock and handle a larger vehicle.
Phipps only has six box truck drivers.
“Box truck drivers, we value them so much,” Phipps said. “I mean, these are all volunteers. These are not paid guys.”
The grocery pick-up route is similar to the school one. Each day of the week, there is a different driver who knows their specific route. They arrive at the pantry early in the morning and have to leave for their first run by 7 a.m. 
They rescue food until the truck is full. It holds 12 pallets, which is usually over 1,000 pounds of food per pallet. 
The driver takes the food back to the pantry, and a volunteer who is trained to use a forklift unloads the food from the truck. Then, usually, they have to go on another trip to stop by more stores.
Stopping at stores and schools helps Interchurch have more variety for Johnson County residents, but it also highlights the importance of the pantry having a variety of food sources.
The work of Interchurch benefits members of the community who do not even make the weekly trip to the food drive-thru. 
“I share with a lot of people. (The pantry) can’t reach everybody, you know, so I got a place in my garage where my neighbors and people that I know are in need, they can come over and get it,” Chris Catt said. 
Whether it is birthday cake, fresh produce, an Einstein’s bagel or Costco cheesecake, the creativity and resourcefulness of food pantries are touching more and more lives.
The Nov. 7 Interchurch drive-thru hosted Hoosiers who may have been furloughed or lost their SNAP benefits as a result of the government shutdown. One woman shed tears as a volunteer approached her with a menu.
She told him this was her first time using a pantry.
Rural and urban needs in Washington 
In Washington state, food scarcity is rural and urban, and food pantries all over have been straining to meet spiking needs, exacerbated by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, new enrollment requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the recent government shutdown. In Seattle, local efforts are creative. They thread through city neighborhoods and often join forces.
At the base of a dorm on the University of Washington Seattle campus, the Husky Food Pantry distributes food to over 700 students and faculty each week.
Most might assume that if a student can afford to go to college, they can also afford groceries. The Husky Food Pantry proves that isn’t true.

In fall 2022, the pantry saw about 300 unique visitors per week. In the 2024-25 school year, that number jumped to 600 visitors on average, and as of late October, the pantry had more than 730 visitors every week, according to River Elewski, the pantry’s student director.
The pantry buys the majority of its food in bulk from Costco with money gathered through its No Hungry Husky donation fund. Seven weeks into the fall quarter, the pantry had redistributed 16,156 pounds of food—rice, beans, milk, grab-and-go bars and more—according to internal data.
“We really do have limited capacity,” Elewski said. “We try to think about, ‘what are staples for folks that are going to stretch further?’”
An occasional pantry treat of fresh bread or cookies comes from Community Loaves, a nonprofit that connects folks baking at home with local pantries. 
A contract with the UW Farm brings in fresh, local-grown produce each week.
Another 2,429 pounds of food has come from university sources, such as unsold food from on-campus cafes, markets and dining halls and food-drive donations. Last June, when the majority of UW’s students moved out for the summer, the pantry ran a drive that brought in 1,230 pounds of food in a week.
South of downtown Seattle, the IDIC Filipino Senior and Family Services Center offers hot lunch and food bank services every Wednesday and Friday. Seniors eat, receive food supplies and participate in Zumba and bingo. 
But these services would not be possible without a series of fundraisers by program director Lanvin Andres. For example, he hosted a 54th anniversary gala last month to appeal to community members. 
“We show them what happens in our program,” Andres said. “We tell them stories from people who benefited from the program directly and hopefully compel them to support the program more permanently.” 
Andres said the food bank doesn’t just rely on fundraising, though. It has to look to a variety of sources, like in-kind donations from Seattle nonprofit Food Lifeline and private grants — supplemental funding that has become increasingly difficult to find.
“Nonprofits like us, and there’s tons of us, have to scour for limited sources,” he said. “So many nonprofits are currently in competition with each other. It’s somewhat of a rat race.” 
Just south of Seattle, faith-based organization Praisealujah hosts monthly drive-thru food giveaways in Burien and SeaTac. The organization has a food service the first Sunday of each month. November’s service drew 3,600 people. 
Praisealujah also receives in-kind donations from Food Lifeline but relies heavily on food rescue from grocery stores and local farms. 
“We send 23 trucks out a day,” said the Rev. Kelly Crow, Praisealujah founder. “We bring in about 800,000 to 900,000 pounds of food a month, and we have semi-trucks that rescue potatoes, onions and lettuce.” 
The trucks drop off supplies at a Praisealujah warehouse where workers sort the food that will be transported to giveaway locations in nearby cities Des Moines and Kent. 
“There’s more to it than just giving food, but building relationships,” he said. “You get to find out the other stuff that they need. We’re all humans, and we all need to be part of the solution.” 
In north Seattle, adjacent to the University of Washington campus, the University District Food Bank has been operating since 1983 and distributes roughly 4 million pounds of food each year to more than 116,000 households.
The food bank sidewalk often is full of people with food—some with paper bags stuffed full, others with soup still hot from the pantry’s cafe.
An elevator ride above the grocery, cafe and food storage spaces are dozens of beds of dirt. From donor money, the University District Food Bank opened its rooftop garden almost a decade ago. This year, volunteers and interns grew onions, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, nasturtiums and garlic and greens like spinach, chard, tatsoi, kale and romaine lettuce. Last year, they harvested 50 pounds of honey.
The 10,000 pounds of produce the garden contributes per year is a fraction of the food bank’s total distribution, but they’re not growing for poundage, executive director Joe Gruber said. It’s a project about building resilience, meeting wider customer needs, and doing the small, significant work that changes how people think about the food system as a whole.]
“The work that we do is changing the food system that we live in,” Gruber said. “It is racist, it is classist. … If we’re intentional in how we engage in this work, how we talk about sustainability up here on the roof, … we can then bring this stuff downstairs and talk to customers about, ‘Hey, these tomatoes,’ or ‘here’s a plant start that we grew up on the roof—do you want it?’”
Wealth inequality in New Mexico
Data collected by the New Mexico Department of Health found that  350,000 people face food insecurity in the state, with one-third of them children, according to Feeding America. Map the Meal Gap, another initiative by Feeding America, found that New Mexico has the seventh-highest hunger rate in the nation. 
While metropolitan areas like Albuquerque offer residents more access to resources, rural areas face totally different challenges than many other regions of the nation. 
Organizations in New Mexico face the unique challenge of dispersing food over a large, mostly rural state with small communities tucked away in mountains, deserts and plains. These rural areas are also where disparities emerge.
Despite these factors, New Mexico is also home to some of the wealthiest communities in the country. Extractive industries like nuclear, oil and gas have created a divide in the state. For example, Los Alamos County, home to Los Alamos National Laboratory, ranks in the top 25 richest counties in the nation according to Google’s Data Commons report. It also has the lowest rate of hunger, with the Los Alamos Food Depot stating that 8.2% of the county is food insecure. This is well below the 16.6% state average from Map the Meal Gap. On the opposite end of the spectrum, McKinley and Luna counties face rates of food insecurity of 23%, another Map the Meal Gap statistic.
Organizations large and small have to work differently from one another to feed people in their areas.
La Mesa Presbyterian Church helps residents of the International District of Albuquerque through its pantry, which sources from a variety of places. The pantry feeds over 400 people a month. Coordinator Roxie Bradley said it gets regular donations from the local food bank, Road Runner Food Bank, as well as from food rescue partners.
Businesses in the area, like Einstein’s Bagels, donate food that otherwise would have been thrown away. But the pantry sometimes lacks in-demand items like canned chicken, for which the church turns to its congregation members to purchase or donate to fill these food needs.
“The congregation has been so supportive,” Bradley said. “One month, we’ll have them donate chicken. Another month, we might have them donate peanut butter.”

Bradley said this direction motivates people to donate since they have clarity in what the pantry needs. The pantry also asks members for monetary donations and for smaller items they may have on hand, like unused utensils from take-out, travel-sized toiletries and plastic bags.
The pantry doesn’t give out pre-made bags of food but allows people to browse for what they want.
“They can choose from whatever’s on the shelf,” Bradley said. “So, if you have a food allergy, or if you’re allergic to something, don’t take it. Or if you don’t like tuna, don’t take tuna.”
To ensure everyone gets food, they ask people to come once a week, but they don’t turn away people who have to come more often. In its 20 years of serving the community, La Mesa Presbyterian has only had to close once due to low stock. 
“Somedays, I get worried about what we’re doing and if we have enough, but it all works out,” Bradley said. “It’s like the loaves and the fishes, everyone somehow gets enough.”
McKinley and Cibola counties in western New Mexico, which include tribal lands like the Navajo Nation and several Pueblos, are, according to Data Commons, among the poorest counties in the state for per-capita personal income. As a result, these counties face some of the most extreme rates of food insecurity.
The Community Pantry serves over 5,000 families a month and operates two facilities in Gallup and Grants as well as several mobile distribution sites on Navajo and Pueblo land, making them one of the largest food assistance organizations in the area.
“The reservation lands are desert,” said Alice Perez, executive director and CEO of the Community Pantry. “There’s no running water, especially back then [when the pantry started], and there was very little electricity. So self-preservation wasn’t necessarily attainable, and it’s still not to this day.”
Perez said the Community Pantry gets 70% of its support from monetary donations, specifically through grant writing and county and foundation funding. It also does some community fundraising, but can’t fully rely on it.
“Fundraising right here is limited,” Perez said. “It’s hard to pull from the community members who are already economically stressed and ask them to give more money.”
The Community Pantry pairs these funds with existing programs, like the Commodity Supplemental Food Program and the Emergency Food Assistance Program, to enhance the food it distributes. When possible, the pantry also partners with an organization in Arizona to distribute water to households that don’t have access. But this water can be hard to get and is in high demand.
“The last one we did, and it was an entire semi load full, that’s almost all gone.” Perez said. “It doesn’t take long to not have water here.”
With federal funding cuts, the Community Pantry had to consolidate. It used to run 14 mobile distribution sites, but now it runs nine. Still, it’s determined to feed the community through collaborative efforts.
“We’re all in the storm together, but we all ride in different boats. Some people have big boats, some people have row boats,” Perez said. “That’s why it’s so important for communities to gather together and collaborate so that we’re not limiting our own resources.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin politicians are responding to the shooting of Alex Pretti, the ICU nurse from Green Bay who was killed Saturday by U.S. Border Patrol agents. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, the frontrunner in the Republican gubernatorial primary, said Monday he hadn’t seen widely circulated video of the shooting.
Pretti’s death prompted protests across the country including in Green Bay, his  hometown. Gov. Tony Evers  joined a lawsuit challenging the presence of federal immigration agents in the Twin Cities. Other Wisconsin politicians issued a variety of statements reacting to the shooting.
U.S. Rep. Tony Wied, whose district includes Green Bay, called the shooting in Minneapolis a “tragedy” in a statement Monday. Pretti was a graduate of Green Bay’s Preble High School. 
“While we await a thorough investigation, I encourage my colleagues to tone down their rhetoric, which has put both law enforcement officers and the public at risk,” Wied said. “We can disagree on the issue but we must do so in a constructive and peaceful manner. Assaulting and impeding federal law enforcement is illegal and a recipe for disaster. As a country, we need to lower the temperature and allow law enforcement to do their jobs.” 
Video of the moments leading up to the shooting, which shows Pretti being pinned down by a group of immigration agents before being shot in the back, does not support Trump administration claims that he tried to assault or impede the agents.
Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is running for governor, said he had not seen the video of the shooting at a Monday press conference, more than 48 hours after the shooting occurred and as video of the shooting has circulated on social media and in major news outlets. Tiffany also called for “full investigation” of the shooting by the state and federal government.
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Tiffany also said people have the right to carry legally registered concealed guns but should consider potential consequences. Pretti was a licensed gun owner, who according to a CNN analysis of bystander video had his gun removed from him before officers shot him. 
“The problem is not the Second Amendment. If I saw a quote accurately this morning… it sounds like (Pretti’s) father had some discussion with him recently, saying, ‘Be careful when you go to something like this, make sure that you don’t get caught up in the chaos,” he said. “And unfortunately, he did.” 
Democrats, including some who are running for governor, criticized Tiffany. 
Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Devin Remiker called Tiffany’s claim not to have seen the video “a pathetic excuse from a pathetic man.” 
“Tom Tiffany is, at best, a clueless coward and at worst a liar. Either way, he’s unfit to serve as governor of Wisconsin,” Remiker said.
“You haven’t watched the video yet? Let me sum it up for you,” former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes said in a social media post. “Trump’s ICE needlessly killed a US citizen without justification.”
Other Democratic candidates had a variety of responses including calling for immigration agents  to vacate Minnesota and calling for the elimination of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  . ICE is responsible for enforcing immigration laws in the United States’s interior, while Border Patrol is supposed to do so near the country’s border, though according to USA Today, the two agencies have become increasingly hard to tell apart under the Trump administration. 
State Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) called for the abolishment of ICE after the shooting. 
“ICE under Trump is incompatible with a free society. The Trump regime is making every single one of us less safe and less free. They are destroying public safety. They refuse to respect our constitution, our law, or our rights,” Roys said in a statement. “The organized, violent actions of ICE have left us with no other choice but to disarm, dismantle, and prosecute ICE.”
State Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), who joined protests according to social media posts, said “Wisconsin stands with everyone resisting ICE in Minnesota” and called ICE an “enforcer of fascism that must be abolished and those responsible for the executions prosecuted.” Last week at a candidate forum with all of the Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls Hong said that “abolishing ICE is a meaningful policy.” 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said that the country needs to “stop pretending that large-scale immigration enforcement operations” in the Midwest are about public safety. 
“People — regardless of immigration status or how federal authorities choose to define them — are in danger when ICE operates this way in our neighborhoods,” Crowley said. “At the same time, I echo Gov. Walz and Minnesota officials in urging people not to respond to violence with violence.” 
Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, who previously had proposed banning ICE from certain sites in Wisconsin, said that “a government that puts its own citizens in harm’s way has failed its most basic responsibility. And I will never look away when the government gets this wrong. We have a choice about who we are and what we stand for: safety without cruelty, accountability without fear, and dignity for every human being.”
Missy Hughes, the former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO, said that “the lawless and deadly ICE invasion of Minneapolis is unAmerican — and Donald Trump is responsible for it.” 
Joel Brennan, the former Department of Administration secretary, said he “recoiled in horror” watching the video of the recent fatal shooting and mourns for Pretti. He called for the “occupation” to end in American cities. 
U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden has repeatedly claimed that the protests against ICE in Minneapolis are equivalent to an “insurrection.” He said on Monday in a Facebook post that he does not “celebrate the death of any American citizen” and the “deaths are tragic, and they never should have happened.” 
But Van Orden blamed Democrats for “fueling hostility toward federal law enforcement.”
“When elected leaders and their allies normalize interference with officers doing their jobs, the outcome is entirely predictable and tragic,” Van Orden said.
Van Orden went on to compare Democratic leaders who have demanded that ICE and Border Patrol agents leave Minneapolis to Civil War Confederates. 
“History has seen this before. In 1861, Confederates in the South demanded that federal troops abandon Fort Sumter. They framed it as de-escalation and local control. In reality, it was a rejection of federal authority and the rule of law. What began as political rhetoric and demands to remove federal presence quickly turned into open conflict, with deadly consequences for the nation,” Van Orden said. “As with any officer-involved shooting, this incident is under investigation. I fully support that process and will be closely following its findings. My support for federal law enforcement, and the rule of law they uphold, remains unwavering.”
CNN reported Monday that Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who has been at the center of the Trump administration immigration enforcement across the country, is leaving Minneapolis and DHS has suspended his access to his social media accounts. Trump is sending border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to take charge of immigration enforcement  operations there.
Rebecca Cooke, who is challenging Van Orden in 2026, said in a social media post that Pretti’s  killing represents “a federal agency out of control. ICE needs to vacate Minnesota and leave our neighbors alone. This is not a policy disagreement, this is a moral imperative.”

After successfully shutting down the University of Wyoming’s DEI office, hard-line Republicans now want to regulate curricula, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Freedom Caucus will keep coming for UW until students, staff and alumni flex their voting block power appeared first on WyoFile .","Once Wyoming’s far-right lawmakers sink their teeth into a national red-meat political target, they naturally thirst for more.

Opinion

That’s why it’s frustrating to see Ed Seidel, the University of Wyoming’s president until his contract expires this summer, use his lame-duck office to lament the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee’s decision to cut UW’s block grant by $40 million while making cuts to Wyoming Public Media and UW Athletics.
Seidel apparently didn’t learn any lessons from the Legislature’s 2024 session, when an amendment was tacked onto the budget bill to keep UW from spending any funds on its Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion or related programming.
If he couldn’t keep the DEI office open back then, how will he defend the university from lawmakers ready to tackle what they’ve branded UW’s “woke” agenda during the budget session that convenes Feb. 9?
Perhaps the current campus community, including students, faculty and staff, as well as the massive alumni network, might be useful. What if Seidel put out the word that he needs backup in this political fight? 
No one knows the value of a UW education better than current and former students.
“It’s driven by misinformation,” Seidel said of the 2024 attack on DEI. “It’s largely driven by things happening on a national level, the kind of things we hear about are not actually happening at the University of Wyoming.”
He was right. Most legislators pushing for the closure had no idea what the office did. They looked at the title and figured it had something to do with helping transgender students or other minorities who got undeserved support for admission and hiring. Some members of the Freedom Caucus branded DEI racist.



In reality, DEI is just the opposite. It refers to policies and practices that ensure all individuals, regardless of their background, have equal opportunities for success and inclusion. It creates an environment where all individuals feel valued, heard and can contribute their unique perspectives.
When it became evident that the Freedom Caucus and its Senate allies were going after DEI funding and trying to close the office, Seidel and UW officials should have made the full Legislature aware that the masterminds behind this were totally off base. UW has saved other programs that have been under attack in recent years, including the gender studies program, which survived an attempt to abolish it during the same budget talks that defunded the DEI office. 
But without funding, UW closed the office and the hard-line Freedom Caucus got the trophy it wanted to brag about before the August GOP primary. It won enough House races in 2024 to take over the chamber the following year. 
It wasn’t done with DEI. The caucus started the 2025 legislative session with its “Five-and-Dime Plan,” which had a plank to further restrict DEI activities.
So, here we are in 2026, and the Freedom Caucus is targeting UW’s budget. In addition to the $40 million block grant reduction, the JAC cut state funding for Wyoming Public Media, $12.5 million in matching state money for fundraising and $6 million from the Athletics Department.
The caucus telegraphed its next move when the JAC’s co-chair, Rep. John Bear of Gillette, told WyoFile the budget cuts are meant to curb “an increase in administration” and “woke education” at UW. The Missouri native and University of Colorado graduate said he believes the university has turned against a “Wyoming way of life.”
Bear indicated he’s working on potential budget footnotes that target the use of state funds for particular curricula.
I’m not above reminding y’all that I saw this coming two years ago when I wrote, “UW President Ed Seidel vowed academic freedom will be protected. But when the Legislature casually guts funding of DEI and related activities, how long will it be before the Freedom Caucus insists on regulating college curricula? Why wouldn’t the university also fall in line with those demands?”
The only thing that could keep the caucus from launching a full assault on UW before the election is a loud public outcry now, especially from conservative alumni willing to speak up.
There’s still time to keep the Legislature from using the budget to demand what courses will be taught — or banned — on UW’s campus. But the Freedom Caucus wants another notch in its belt for sticking it to the university before the August primary, when it could add seats or lose its House control.
In a campus-wide email after JAC’s cuts were made, Seidel noted UW is informing legislators about the potential impacts of a reduction of this magnitude.
“We have hope that the decision-makers will recognize, as did the governor, that such a cut … would be both harmful and unnecessary, especially considering the lack of a financial crisis for state government,” Seidel wrote.
Yep, I’m sure the Freedom Caucus is quaking in its boots because UW plans to discuss its plight with other lawmakers to win them over. This bunch will do anything it can to torch classes and programs it doesn’t like, and after its success closing the DEI office, why would it ever back down?
UW’s administration has no control over the situation. The caucus has a veto-proof majority in the House and isn’t afraid of the governor.
The only thing that could keep the caucus from launching a full assault on UW before the election is a loud public outcry now, especially from conservative alumni willing to speak up.
Seidel isn’t helping when he says lawmakers have legitimate concerns, such as “whether or not universities across the country have liberal environments, and therefore conservative voices are suppressed.”
Mr. President, I can assure you that conservative voices aren’t suppressed in Wyoming, and in fact dominate almost every issue at the Legislature. There’s no need to be sympathetic or provide more ammunition to their cause; they already have your campus surrounded.
It’s time to call on students, faculty, staff and alumni to get organized for the upcoming legislative session and the next election.

We will pay for long-term care for seniors and adults with disabilities one way or another. But lawmakers have chosen a more expensive and less effective option, writes guest columnist Nikki Green.
The post Cutting the Community Choices Waiver doesn’t save money — it just shifts the costs appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s recent decision to deny a proposed funding increase for the Community Choices Waiver deserves more public attention, not because it is dramatic, but because it is quietly consequential.

Opinion

The Community Choices Waiver is a Medicaid home- and community-based services program administered by the Wyoming Department of Health that allows seniors and adults with disabilities to receive long-term care in their own homes instead of in nursing facilities. It pays for practical, everyday supports: help with bathing and dressing, meal preparation, medication management, light housekeeping, transportation and caregiver support. These are not luxuries. These are the services that make the difference between remaining safely at home and being placed in an institution.
It is also important to be clear about who this program serves. This waiver is a Medicaid program, which means it supports the poorest and most medically vulnerable Wyomingites — people who have already spent down their life savings, who do not have long-term care insurance and who cannot afford to pay privately for care. For them, this is not a convenience or a supplement. It is the last safety net.
The funding increase recently denied by the Joint Appropriations Committee totals about $11.24 million in state funds. Because this is a Medicaid program, that decision also blocks about $16.4 million in federal matching funds. In total, roughly $27.6 million that could have supported Wyoming residents in their homes and communities will not be available.
Supporters of budget cuts often frame decisions like this as fiscal restraint. But in this case, Wyoming-specific cost data tells a different story.
In Wyoming, the cost of long-term care is already high. According to widely used cost-of-care surveys, home-based supports such as homemaker services and home health aides typically cost tens of thousands of dollars per year, and assisted living often exceeds $50,000 annually. Nursing facility care, by contrast, routinely exceeds $100,000 per year per person.
Even in Wyoming’s own cost environment, institutional care is substantially more expensive than supporting people at home.
When community services are underfunded, people do not suddenly become less needy or more independent. They simply enter more expensive settings — and Medicaid pays the bill anyway, only now at a much higher rate. This is not a choice between spending and not spending. It is a choice between spending earlier, more strategically and at lower cost, or spending later, reactively and at much higher cost.
There are also system-level consequences that do not show up neatly in budget spreadsheets. Wyoming already faces serious workforce shortages in home- and community-based care, especially in rural areas. When reimbursement rates do not keep pace with real-world costs, agencies cannot hire or retain workers. When agencies cannot staff services, services cannot be delivered. When services cannot be delivered, people cannot remain at home — even if home is where they want to be and where they would be safest and most stable.
Once someone enters an institution, it is both difficult and expensive to transition them back to the community. Housing is often lost. Support networks are disrupted. Functional abilities frequently decline. What might have been a manageable level of support at home becomes a much more complex and much more expensive system of care.
This is not just a policy issue. It is a trust issue.
There is also a generational dimension to this conversation that deserves attention. Many of the people now relying on programs like the Community Choices Waiver were told throughout their working lives that if they worked, paid into the system and played by the rules, Social Security, Medicare and related supports would be there when they needed them. They planned their futures around that promise. Now, when they need relatively modest help to remain in their own homes, the system is tightening around them.
This is not just a policy issue. It is a trust issue.
It is also a family issue. When home- and community-based services are underfunded or unavailable, the burden does not disappear. It shifts to spouses in their 70s caring for partners with complex medical needs, to adult children trying to juggle jobs and caregiving responsibilities, or to families who eventually face an impossible choice between burnout and institutional placement.
None of this is to suggest that Wyoming should not care about budgets. Of course it should. But smart budgeting is not just about cutting line items. It is about understanding which investments prevent crises, reduce long-term costs and stabilize systems before they break.
The Community Choices Waiver is not an experimental program. It is not a luxury. It is one of the most cost-effective tools Wyoming has to support aging adults and people with disabilities while also protecting taxpayers from the far higher costs of institutional care.
There is also a federal funding reality that should matter to anyone concerned about Wyoming’s fiscal position. When the state declines to fund its share of a Medicaid program like CCW, it also walks away from federal matching dollars — money Wyoming residents already pay into through federal taxes. In this case, that means leaving more than $16 million in federal funds on the table while still facing the same long-term care needs.
That is not fiscal restraint. It is a false economy.
The real question facing Wyoming is not whether we will pay for long-term care. An aging population makes that unavoidable.
The real question is whether we will pay less, earlier and more wisely, by supporting people in their homes, or more, later and in crisis, by relying on institutional care after families and systems have already been pushed to the breaking point.
The Community Choices Waiver sits right at the center of that choice.

That very same day, a thousand miles away in Washington, DC, HR1— also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) — was signed into law. Yet for people here, the passage of the bill was a mere blip in the national headlines. It was not apparent that it would become an economic earthquake, triggering a tsunami of devastating after-effects soon to crash down on our rural communities.
The massive tax cut and spending bill is the most dramatic restructuring of federal budget priorities in six decades. The president called the OBBBA his “greatest victory” and the “most popular bill ever signed.” The White House issued only a scant 237-word press release summarizing the 900-page law; the substance of the law itself was barely mentioned. When it was enacted, nearly two-thirds of Americans said they knew “little or nothing” about what was in the bill.
When asked about his support of the bill, my own representative from Wisconsin’s 3rd Congressional District, Derrick Van Orden, dismissed any suggestion that the White House had influenced his vote. “The president of the United States didn’t give us an assignment. We’re not a bunch of little bitches around here, OK? I’m a member of Congress, I represent almost 800,000 Wisconsinites.” 
The OBBBA permanently extends the 2017 tax cuts and locks in a historic upward transfer of wealth. The top 1% of households receive an average tax cut of $66,000. Working families earning $53,000 or less get a tax cut of just $325. Roughly $1 trillion dollars will flow to the richest households over the next decade, while Medicaid, nutrition assistance, and health coverage are drastically scaled back, pushing 15 million people off insurance. 
 ‘I want to be part of a strategy, something that’s actually effective’

Last August, 70 of us gathered on a Saturday in Woodville, Wisconsin, population 1,400, with the understanding that something consequential was happening in our nation, yet struggling to figure out how we can respond. We filled a community center on Main Street for six hours: teachers, farmers, retirees, retail workers, students, small business owners. People brought notebooks and coffee. The windows were open. Ceiling fans spun slowly overhead. 
“I’m tired of complaining, feeling like a victim, worried about what’s going to happen next,” one of our members put it plainly. “I want to be part of a strategy, something that’s actually effective.”
I organize with Grassroots Organizing Western Wisconsin (GROWW). Our work has always started from a simple question: How does power move in the places we live? Since the organization began, our focus has been on local issues like housing, agriculture and rural broadband. But, at that meeting in Woodville, we were trying to name what was happening: how the political chaos in our federal government was flowing down to our families, counties, schools, cities, hospitals, town boards. And, most importantly, what we could actually do about it. 
That day in Woodville we made a plan. It did not involve protest or messaging. Our organizing has never been about reacting the fastest or shouting the loudest. Power is built methodically: identifying who makes decisions, who feels the consequences, and where solidarity can be established and strengthened before a harm is normalized and written off as inevitable. That is why we started with listening.










“Most Americans don’t realize how dramatically state and local governments — which most directly affect their daily lives — are about to change.”


– Eric Schnurer, public policy consultant


During the following three months we sat down face to face with nearly 100 local leaders across four counties. We met in offices, conference rooms and coffee shops. We spoke with school superintendents, sheriffs, county administrators, hospital executives, clergy, elected officials, business owners. We asked the same questions over and over: what were people experiencing in their jobs, what pressures were they under, what was keeping them up at night?
Many people we spoke with were overwhelmed by the effort required to stay focused on their jobs: the to-do lists, budgets, hiring, planning. One program director told us her job was mostly “putting out fires.” When we asked how they were reacting to federal policy changes, most people didn’t have much to say. Unless it was affecting them today, they didn’t have the luxury to worry about it. 
Each conversation made clear how county governments in rural Wisconsin are lifelines, not faceless bureaucracies. They plow snow, run elections, maintain roads, administer BadgerCare and SNAP, respond to mental health crises, operate nursing homes, and answer 911 calls. And they are already stretched thin.
Funding was the issue mentioned the most. A county administrator walked us through the elaborate gymnastics required to balance a county budget under state-imposed levy limits that make raising revenue nearly impossible: wheel taxes, bond sales, consolidating services. One-time fixes layered on top of structural gaps. Again, it came back to resources. Not culture wars, not ideology. Money.
 Delaying the pain

What surprised us most was what we did not hear. Despite anxiety about shrinking budgets, very few people mentioned the One Big Beautiful Bill. It had not yet made a mark on their daily work. That is not accidental. The new law is designed to delay the pain, disperse responsibility, and conceal the damage out of public view until it feels inevitable.
We decided to look into the law’s ramifications. We did our own research, and what we learned is that rural and small-town communities in western Wisconsin are in for a slow-motion fiscal disaster, and that regular people will be the ones who pay the price. 
Starting in 2027, the federal government is scheduled to cut its share of SNAP administrative costs in half. In counties like Dunn, that shift could mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in new local costs. A smaller administrative budget means fewer staff, which means slower processing, higher error rates, and federal penalties that reduce funding even further. The OBBBA seems designed to trigger countless downward spirals that degrade programs until they can be declared broken.
The repercussions for Medicaid follow the same pattern. At Golden Age Manor, the beloved county-run nursing home in Amery, where most of the services are Medicaid funded, even modest reimbursement cuts will translate into tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars lost each year. At the same time, more uninsured residents will still need care.
Across our counties, more than 10,000 people rely on ACA Marketplace coverage for their health insurance. Since federal tax credits expired at the end of 2025, families face premium increases averaging around $1,600 a year. Some will pay far more. Many will drop coverage altogether. When they do, costs will shift to county-funded behavioral health systems and other services already operating at the limits of their resources.
One sheriff described what that will look like in practice: “When someone is in a mental health crisis, our deputies already spend hours driving them across the state because there are no beds here,” he said. “If people lose coverage, those crises do not go away. They show up as 911 calls.”
 We must act before the tsunami arrives

A tsunami is set in motion by a distant earthquake that no one feels. Life happens on shore while energy gathers fiercely far out at sea. Only a seismograph sounds the alarm. Once the wave arrives, entire cities are engulfed, communities washed out to sea. Trump’s massive tax cut and spending law was that earthquake. We have decided to act before the wave arrives.
Local governments will be forced to navigate what policy expert Eric Schnurer described as “fiscal and operational crises,” but few people will be able to connect what happens to a bill passed last year. “Most Americans don’t realize how dramatically state and local governments — which most directly affect their daily lives — are about to change.”










This fight will not be won by politicians, consultants, or pollsters. It will be won by regular people who have decided to build a movement town by town, county by county, state by state.


County budget hearings were held in November. They often happen with no public comment, gaveled in and gaveled out in a matter of minutes. Last year we showed up and filled the rooms. We brought letters we had drafted, breaking down projected budget impacts county by county. We delivered testimony from the podium. Our goal was not to blame our county leaders, but to signal our alignment with them. 
After one hearing, a county administrator, a self-identified fiscal conservative, met with us and said, “Every point you raised in your letter was correct. Our county government has to brace for what’s coming, and you made that clear to everyone in the room.”
 The people who will be hit hardest

We know our county boards are not responsible for causing this disaster, yet they will be forced to deal with it, while we, the residents, will be the ones who feel the cuts most deeply. Our members of Congress who voted “yes” for this bill are the ones responsible for this mess. 
Letters and testimony are not enough. What we need is power. For regular people like us, there is but one path to power: organizing. That means we have to talk to those who will be most affected, inviting them to see their personal stake in this fight. The single parent in River Falls, juggling two part-time jobs and relying on SNAP to keep food on the table. The kid with asthma in Boyceville, whose parents rely on ACA coverage, now at risk of losing access to care. The retired farmer outside Balsam Lake, whose wife’s long-term care at Golden Age Manor nursing home is covered through Medicaid. 
Our long game is to begin the conversation about what it will take for Congress to repeal the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The path to repeal will be fraught with political roadblocks and fiercely opposed by the corporate class, which has been true for every consequential victory working people have ever won in this country. Repealing the law must become a defining issue in every political conversation in America – at dinner tables, at bus stops, and on Reddit threads – starting now and continuing until the law is gone. 










While showering billionaires with tax benefits, the OBBBA also massively expands the machinery of repression. It quadrupled the budget of ICE, expanding its force by 10,000 agents


Cracks are already beginning to form. Earlier this month, Rep. Van Orden, along with 17 other Republicans in the House of Representatives, backpedaled on his support of the OBBBA by voting to extend ACA tax credits (more than 30,000 people are expected to lose health insurance in Van Orden’s district). However, the opposition stiffens. Shortly after the vote, in a disciplinary move, Americans For Prosperity announced it was pausing support for those who defected.
 Cutting services, expanding the machinery of repression

As I write, immigration agents are spilling into western Wisconsin from Minneapolis, swarming small towns and rural communities across the region. They are driving unmarked vehicles with out-of-state plates. Some members of our organization have built rapid response networks in solidarity with immigrant-led groups. Meanwhile, our neighbors are being terrorized, taken from their homes, and families are being ripped apart. Some local Mexican restaurants and grocery stores have closed their doors. Just sixty miles west, in Minneapolis, two American citizens have been killed by ICE agents. 
This is not a coincidence. While showering billionaires with tax benefits, the OBBBA also massively expands the machinery of repression. It quadrupled the budget of ICE, expanding its force by 10,000 agents and thereby transforming the agency into one larger than most national militaries. On one hand, the administration subjects us to the cruel spectacle of paramilitary raids, disappearances and death. On the other, the administration dismantles the social safety nets that keep people alive, then redistributes public resources to the wealthiest few. A loud disruptive culture war creates a smokescreen for a quiet methodical class war. 
The fight for Congress to repeal the OBBBA will be a David versus Goliath fight. It is a fight about whether the super-rich will be able to bleed us dry and starve our local institutions. Whether our neighbors will die as wealth is extracted from above. Whether daily life for a majority of Americans will be defined by relentless top-down class war. 
This fight will not be won by politicians, consultants, or pollsters. It will be won by regular people who have decided to build a movement town by town, county by county, state by state. The ramifications of the OBBBA are so wide and deep that a new political coalition will be necessary, one big enough to include anyone who isn’t a billionaire. Republicans, Democrats, independents, libertarians, socialists, and people who’ve lost faith in politics altogether. White people, brown people, Black people, young people, old people. The poor, the working class, the middle class. 
An unwavering commitment to big tent politics and multiracial solidarity is how we defeat the divide-and-conquer tactics this administration relies upon. Building trust and power across differences. Not reinforcing divides through purity tests or theoretical debate. Listening for common ground and shared humanity. Seeing every person as a potential ally, not an enemy to defeat. We must organize, strategize and mobilize until regular Americans have won the freedom to make ends meet, live with dignity, and have a voice in the decisions that affect us.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Many Idahoans still think the state is headed in the right direction, but they are worried about the state’s economy, a new survey shows.
About four in 10 Idahoans — 42% — expect the state’s economic conditions to worsen over the next two years, while a quarter expect Idaho’s economy to improve, according to Boise State University’s annual Idaho Public Policy Survey released Friday.
Idahoans’ attitudes toward the state’s economic future shifted significantly since last year, with a 19-point swing away from optimism and toward pessimism, the survey showed. Roughly 29% of Idahoans expect the state’s economy to remain the same, which was similar last year.
Researchers behind the survey believe national events likely influenced Idahoans’ attitudes toward the state economy.
“The fact that you had tariffs on the top of people’s minds, we had the economic uncertainty and all of the price volatility over the summer, I think that was probably on a lot of people’s minds. And not quite knowing what was coming next is potentially … why we see more people racing for economic uncertainty,” Matthew May, survey research director for Boise State University’s School of Public Service, told reporters Friday. 
But even with the economic anxiety, Idahoans still largely felt the state is headed in the right direction, with 46% of Idahoans saying they believed that compared to almost 38% of residents saying the state is on the wrong track. Those opinions didn’t change much from last year, when most Idahoans for the first time in six years said they felt the state was on the right track. 
“All together, this year’s survey results reflect the delicate balance of a complex Idaho citizenry,” a report on the poll concluded. “Idahoans are split, with pluralities simultaneously believing optimistically that the state is headed in the right direction but pessimistically expecting its economy to get worse over the next two years.”
The survey, conducted Nov. 8-17, surveyed 1,000 Idaho adults who lived in 42 of the state’s 44 counties. It has a margin of error of 3.1%, indicating how much Idahoans’ actual opinions could vary from the survey findings. 
The poll also shows that most Idahoans appear to support a proposed ballot initiative that would overturn Idaho’s strict abortion ban and establish reproductive health rights.

 Most Idahoans would support ballot initiative to legalize abortion, protect reproductive rights

In the November general election, Idaho voters could be asked if they want to repeal Idaho’s strict abortion ban.
The survey showed that a majority of Idahoans appear to support the proposed ballot initiative. Here’s what it found:

Pollsters asked about the ballot initiative in two ways. Both questions laid out the initiative as establishing “a right to make private reproductive health care decisions, including abortion up to fetal viability and in medical emergencies.” But one question gave the initiative’s official title, which is the “Reproductive Freedom and Privacy Act.”
Without the name, 59% of Idahoans said they support the initiative. With the name, support slightly bumped up to 61%. 

In a newsletter, organizers of the initiative touted the poll as showing strong support for the initiative.
“Radical lobbyists and politicians imposed an extreme ban on every Idahoan, but most Idahoans simply don’t agree,” wrote Melanie Folwell, executive director for Idahoans United for Women and Families.
The survey didn’t ask about two other drug-related questions that could be on Idaho voters’ November ballots: A constitutional amendment proposed by the Legislature that would strip voters’ rights to legalize drugs, and a possible ballot initiative that would legalize medicinal marijuana. 
 What else the survey asked about: Tax policy, private education tax credits, housing affordability, public lands, and ICE

The survey also asked about a range of other policy issues. Here’s some highlights: 

Economic anxiety hits home for some. Asked about their general financial situation, the largest share of Idahoans, 43%, said they or their families are just getting by. About 35% said they are living comfortably, and 20% said they are finding it difficult to get by. 


High support for last year’s private school tax credit. When asked if they supported the Legislature’s law — which created a $50 million fund to dole out $5,000 tax credits for students to attend private school — most Idahoans said they supported it. Support was higher, at 61%, when pollsters called the legislation House Bill 93, compared to when pollsters called it the Idaho Parental Choice Tax Credit, which had 56% support.


Housing affordability remains a top priority. About 39% of respondents said that housing affordability is their top priority, followed by nearly 26% of people listing K-12 education, almost 15% saying tax relief, and roughly 12% saying transportation and infrastructure.
Most Idahoans think property taxes are too high. Nearly 52% of Idahoans said they think property taxes in the state are too high. Roughly 35% said property taxes were about right, almost 12% weren’t sure and 2% said they were too low. 


But tax structure preferences aren’t that clear. Almost half, roughly 46% of Idahoans, said they would prefer a tax structure that has lower property taxes in exchange for higher sales taxes. But other Idahoans seemed split between not being sure on which tax structure they’d prefer, or if property tax should be higher in exchange for lower sales taxes. 


Many Idahoans don’t want feds to turn over public lands to the state. Told that the federal government turning over public lands to Idaho could cost the state millions of dollars each year, almost half — 46% — of Idahoans said they’d oppose that move. About 35% said they’d support it, and 18% weren’t sure. 


Most Idahoans think more ICE presence would harm ag economy. More than half — 53% – of Idahoans said they think an increased presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the state would harm Idaho’s agricultural economy. Around 19% said more ICE presence would help the state’s ag economy, while 18% predicted it wouldn’t have an impact and 10% said they weren’t sure what it would do.

The experience prompted the Fayetteville retiree to advocate for a citizen-led constitutional amendment voters approved in 2016 to create Arkansas’ medical marijuana program. 
That program has since grown into a billion-dollar industry, with more than 115,000 patients using marijuana to treat conditions from Crohn’s disease to post-traumatic stress disorder. But an obscure legal fight over who can change citizen-led amendments to Arkansas’ Constitution casts uncertainty on the program’s future.
The court ruling is part of a nationwide battle playing out in states like Missouri and Nebraska over citizen-led ballot measures. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allows citizens to propose state laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Since the state’s first dispensary opened in 2019, thousands of Arkansans have accessed the program, including Christopher Duffy, a 35-year-old Fayetteville resident who said medical marijuana helped his anxiety and sobriety. Duffy said he’d remain committed to sobriety if marijuana becomes less accessible, but he worries about others.
“I’m lucky to have such a support system where were things to get tough or I started struggling, I could reach out,” he said. “There are those that don’t have that and I fear for them.”

Williams, 69, is afraid of losing access to medical marijuana, which she uses to manage ongoing complications from her illness.
“If I am not able to use this, my life would be completely, negatively impacted,” she said.
These concerns were sparked by the Arkansas Supreme Court upending 74 years of precedent in December with a ruling that declared lawmakers can amend citizen-led constitutional amendments with a two-thirds vote — 67 votes in the House and 24 votes in the Senate. 
The decision stemmed from a case challenging the Legislature’s passage of laws amending the Arkansas Medical Marijuana Amendment. However, lawmakers’ newly affirmed authority extends beyond medical marijuana to other citizen-led amendments, including those that affect casinos and the minimum wage.

David Couch, a Little Rock lawyer who helped write the medical marijuana amendment, said the court’s decision “absolutely” adds more pressure that a new ballot measure he’s backing be successful. 
If the measure, which was proposed by Save AR Democracy, qualifies for the 2026 ballot and is approved by voters, it would prohibit lawmakers from changing the Arkansas Constitution themselves and require voters to approve any new law affecting the initiative and referendum process.
Although he understands how the court arrived at its conclusion, Couch said the justices erred in their application. 
“The thing that bothers me the most is they applied it retroactively, not prospectively,” he said. “They upended 115 years of work by the people of the state of Arkansas on these initiatives.”
Knoxville Republican Rep. Aaron Pilkington said the court’s ruling affirmed what he long believed to be true; however, he doesn’t think lawmakers are “chomping at the bit” to alter popular amendments. 
Pilkington took office in 2017, just after 53% of voters approved medical marijuana. While Republicans weren’t generally in favor of it, Pilkington noted the party’s leaders didn’t stand in the way of what voters asked for. 
“I think we’ve actually shown a history of even if maybe the Legislature doesn’t necessarily agree with it, they’re going to honor the wishes of the voters,” he said. “Because had we not, had we tried to force this issue back then or cause this and that, I think you would have seen repercussions in those next elections.”
Pilkington has since sponsored legislation on medical marijuana, including an unsuccessful effort to allow dispensaries to deliver. Pilkington said there may be some tinkering to the program, but he’s not really open to amending it given the increasing revenue from sales that funds certain programs. 
Arkansans spent a record $291.1 million on medical marijuana in 2025, according to the state’s Department of Finance and Administration. Legislation approved last year allows tax revenue from those sales to support free breakfast for students.
Industry professionals reflect on five years of medical marijuana in Arkansas

Though it may be used sparingly, the authority to amend the state’s constitution could be useful to address policies that aren’t working the way they were intended or to reflect a shift in perspective that’s occurred since an amendment was first approved, Pilkington said.
It also allows lawmakers to address issues that require immediate attention instead of waiting two years to present a measure to voters, Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester said.
The Arkansas Constitution can be changed when voters approve a measure proposed by lawmakers or by citizens who must qualify for the ballot by circulating petitions. Proposed amendments may be considered every two years during the general election.
Republicans currently have a supermajority in both the House and Senate, but Hester said a two-thirds vote is a “huge, hard bar to meet,” regardless of which party has a majority.
The Cave Springs Republican said lawmakers will only use this authority when “absolutely necessary” and will likely wait until the 2027 legislative session to review citizen-led amendments, such as those that received a lot of financial support from out-of-state interests. Hester also mentioned reviewing measures related to medical marijuana and casinos because they were “huge amendments” with multiple provisions. 
“I think that it might be reasonable that the Legislature look at them a little bit at a time versus holistically, and I think that’s the responsible thing to do,” he said. 
Hester noted lawmakers can only amend the marijuana amendment, not repeal it. That leaves some room to scale back or expand the program without ending it entirely.
While the Legislature may not intend to overrule voters, Duffy said he believes there are some lawmakers willing to do so, therefore he’s hopeful Save AR Democracy’s ballot measure will succeed.
The group needs to collect 90,704 signatures by July 3 to qualify for the ballot.
“I don’t see any intent from the Legislature to override the will of the people, but I feel like there are some that are willing to do that and that is what’s concerning,” Duffy said. 
Should the measure fail and lawmakers head into the 2027 legislative session with their court-affirmed amendment authority, Duffy said he could see them increasing medical marijuana taxes. 
That could prompt patients to purchase from neighboring states like Missouri, where recreational marijuana is also legal, driving revenue out of Arkansas, he said. 
Williams is skeptical about lawmakers’ restraint and said she believes they intend “to gut it to the extent that it is almost impossible to use.”
“I would like to ask one of these legislators if they know what it feels like to get up in the morning and wonder how sick you’re going to feel that day,” she said.

The powerful owners of a payday lending company faced a crisis in March 2021 when their other business, a now-defunct sports gambling operation, was under investigation by Tennessee regulators.
The couple, Michael and Tina Hodges, had already turned to Tennessee Speaker of the House Cameron Sexton in 2014 to create a new triple-digit interest loan called a “Flex Loan.” The couple’s company, Advance Financial, through the Flex Loan, went on to make hundreds of millions of dollars lending to the state’s most financially vulnerable.
Now they needed Sexton’s help keeping their fledgling gambling business, Action 247, afloat as it tried to compete with sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings, which were dominating the market in Tennessee and around the country.
In many states, regulators try to keep lending and betting separate; Virginia, for example, bans gambling operators from offering loans to customers. But in Tennessee, it’s different. A payday lender and a gambling company can have the same owners and operate out of the same storefronts.
From November 2020 through Jan. 16, when Action 247 closed, this was happening. A person could walk into any Advance Financial storefront and borrow up to $4,000 at a 279.5% interest rate. Then, at the same window, the customer could legally tell the store’s employee to deposit cash into an Action 247 account, through which they could gamble the money on something like a football game.
Members of the Tennessee Education Lottery Corp., which oversaw sports gambling at the time, were concerned by the arrangement and the company, but the agency’s board was prevented from doing anything about it by its attorney in January 2021. Two months later, the board attempted to assert its power over Action 247 by suspending its license for violations related to its failure to ensure that customers adhered to state gambling laws; ultimately, Action 247 went to court, where a judge lifted the suspension but allowed the agency to continue its investigation.
That’s when Sexton stepped in.
The Hodges own the majority of both Action 247 and Advance Financial. The payday lender is one of the largest donors to Sexton and his political action committee, giving around $105,000 over the past decade.
ProPublica and the Tennessee Lookout previously reported how, after creating the new type of payday loan, Advance went on to sue more than 110,000 Tennesseans, making the company one of the single largest plaintiffs in the state.

Through Action, the Hodges also brought in dozens of investors, including two with political ties to Sexton and other powerful state lawmakers, according to an investor document obtained by the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica.
A month after the suspension, Sexton met with two members of the lottery board. The legislator “made it clear he was not happy” with the decision to suspend Action 247, said Susan Lanigan, the chair of the Tennessee Education Lottery Corp.’s board at the time.
When it appeared lottery officials weren’t going to drop their ongoing investigation into Action, Sexton pushed through legislation to remove the board’s control over sports betting. Less than a month after the closed-door meeting with Lanigan, the state lottery was out of sports gaming and a new regulator, over whom members of the legislature could wield more control, was in.
Sexton responded to the news outlets’ questions with a statement in which he said that creating the new regulatory body was a policy decision that included members of the lottery.
After the lottery lost control of sports gambling, it ended the investigation into Action. The company survived, but as one of the smallest sportsbooks in Tennessee. National brands have dominated sports betting in the state.
Action announced on its website on Jan. 16 that it was shutting down. Cullen Earnest, the senior vice president of public policy at Advance Financial and a onetime lobbyist for Action 247, sent a statement from Tina Hodges, who said, “The current landscape for state-licensed online sports gambling in the United States has proven to be unviable and unprofitable for all operators in the industry.”
The Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica have been investigating Advance and Action for more than a year. In December 2025, a reporter sent Earnest and Sexton a list of questions about the company’s politically tied investors and the connections between the gambling and lending businesses. Sexton said, in an emailed statement, “I don’t keep up with each and every investment of people I know.” Earnest didn’t respond to the specific questions.
Tennessee lawmakers and lenders said this law would protect borrowers, but it trapped them in debt

Earnest, when asked about the lottery investigation, said by email that the agency “was obviously not up to the task” of regulating sports betting.
With Action’s closure, no payday lender is tied to a gambling company, but under Tennessee law it’s still allowed.
Brianne Doura-Schawohl, the former legislative director for the gambling harm-reduction advocacy organization National Council on Problem Gambling, said the mixing of high-interest lending and gambling is problematic because studies show people with a gambling addiction are more likely to struggle with their financial decisions and to borrow money they can’t afford to pay back through products like payday loans.
Doura-Schawohl said no other state had a scenario where a high-interest lender owns a gambling operation and can use its storefronts to attract customers.
“It’s just really unhealthy and, frankly, predatory,” she said.
In Tennessee, however, Advance Financial has about 80 storefronts, and Action 247 had operations at all of them for over six years.

“We Were Alarmed”
In April 2020, the Tennessee lottery board opened applications for businesses to apply for licenses to run online sports betting operations. Action 247 had been founded a year earlier, the day after lawmakers legalized sports betting, hoping to be one of the first companies to enter the new business. All companies seeking a sports betting license were required to undergo vetting before receiving approval, and during that process, Lanigan said lottery officials believed at the time that Action would operate independently of Advance.
Regulators approved Action’s license, and the company launched its online sports betting operations in November and began offering all Advance Financial stores as a place to deposit into or cash out of an Action betting account.
At the time, Tennessee law said nothing about payday lenders working with betting companies. The lottery had no rules banning the practice. But in its regulations of lottery and scratch tickets, it prevented stores like Advance from selling the products, acknowledging the dangers of mixing lending and that form of gambling.
But almost two weeks after the launch of online sports betting, regulators grew concerned. A gambling investigator for the lottery, working off a tip, entered an Advance store in Nashville and found brochures advertising Action 247.
“Action 24/7 is the first locally owned and operated sports book in Tennessee, offering convenient cash deposits and withdrawals,” the brochures read. “It’s so easy. For a $2 fee, any Advance Financial store location can help you withdraw your cash or load your account.”

With the brochure in hand, officials began drafting a violation notice.
Regulators emailed Tina Hodges in December 2020, asserting that the company was using Advance as an “unregistered vendor” and asking her to explain how the companies were working together. “It is evident that our licensing decision may have been based on an incomplete picture of your business model,” said lottery officials in the notice.
At a January 2021 meeting, the lottery board learned from its attorney that there was no law specifically banning the Action and Advance arrangement.
“We were alarmed,” said Lanigan, the chair at the time.
Lanigan made it clear at the meeting that the lottery board itself couldn’t stop the practice. But regulators continued to look into the company, finding it lacked proper internal controls to enforce the state’s gambling laws. By March 2021, the lottery board took the regulators’ recommendations to suspend the company until it could fix them.
A week later, a judge ruled the company should remain in business while the investigation continued. But now lottery officials had grabbed the attention of Sexton.
In March 2021 — the same month that the board suspended the Action 247 operations — legislation Sexton co-sponsored to remove the lottery board’s control of online sports betting entirely received its first committee hearing in the state House.
In 2021, Sexton was two years into his position as the state’s most powerful legislative official, and his rise had been in part aided by campaign donations from the Hodges. The steps he took to remove the regulators stood to help not just the couple but also some politically connected investors in Action 247, according to an investor document.
One of them was John “Chip” Saltsman, who took the job as Sexton’s senior campaign adviser when he became speaker in 2019. The other was Ward Baker, a campaign adviser for Tennessee’s two U.S. senators and the state Senate majority leader. Saltsman initially invested $150,000 and Baker $100,000, but Advance’s owners had returned some of the investment, leaving Saltsman with $18,000 invested in the company and Baker with $12,000.
Saltsman and Baker did not respond to calls, texts and questions sent by the news outlets. Sexton, in an emailed statement, said: “Despite what you are insinuating, my focus and decisions remain on the issues that matter to our state, our communities and to Tennesseans. My team manages campaign logistics, provides transparency and ensures compliance to campaign laws.”
In April, as Sexton’s bill moved through the state legislature, Lanigan, the lottery board chair, and William Carver, the vice chair, met with Sexton. Lanigan said she came to the meeting expecting a thorough conversation about the future of sports betting and which regulatory body should oversee it. Instead, she said, Sexton only wanted to talk about the suspension of Action 247 and his frustration at lottery officials. Taken aback, she resigned shortly after the meeting.
This lender said its loans would help Tennesseans. It has sued more than 110,000 of them.

In May 2021, in the final days of the legislative session, Sexton pushed his legislation through.
When Tennessee passed its law giving the lottery control of sports betting and oversight of a sports wagering advisory council, Sexton wasn’t the House speaker. Two years later, at Sexton’s behest, lawmakers reversed this decision by creating a sports-betting-specific agency that, according to Doura-Schawohl, doesn’t exist in any other state.
In his emailed statement, Sexton said that some members of the sports wagering advisory council “had serious issues” with how the lottery was conducting business when it came to sports betting. He said that the decision to create the new entity happened “after much discussion and deliberation with board members.”
William Orgel, a member of the sports wagering advisory council since 2019 and current chair of the new body, said the council doesn’t involve itself in legislative policy, adding if the lawmakers thought a new agency was necessary, the panel would “say fine.”
“I believe our body has been pretty hands-off, at least I have,” Orgel said. “I’m not in there trying to make or lobby for the rules or policy, and I’ve never heard of anyone else doing that either.”
While Sexton was working on removing the lottery’s control, former Democratic state Rep. Darren Jernigan of Nashville said he saw the news of Advance and Action’s co-mingling and decided to propose a law to ban it.
Jernigan found a Republican sponsor in the state Senate and built a bipartisan coalition of nearly one-third of the state’s House members to co-sponsor the bill.
Jernigan said that the legislation was a “no-brainer.” The American Gaming Association reported in July 2025 that 35 of the 38 states that have legalized gambling, plus Washington, D.C., have limits on gaming operators allowing bettors to use borrowed money. This includes Tennessee, where lawmakers have barred gamblers from using a credit card to load money into an account.
Jernigan told the Tennessee Lookout and ProPublica he thought it was dangerous to put any type of gambling operations in places that also offer quick, high-interest loans.
“There was no way to verify if someone was borrowing and betting the money away,” Jernigan said.
Once the bill was moving, however, the lobbying started. Jernigan said Earnest, the Advance vice president, working on behalf of both Hodges-owned companies as a lobbyist, went around trying to persuade his co-sponsors to drop their support of the bill. Former state Rep. Sam Whitson, a Republican, said the lobbyist approached him in an effort to get him to withdraw his backing.
The bill faced delay after delay advancing out of its committee. In April 2021, as the state House’s banking subcommittee looked poised to vote down the legislation, Jernigan withdrew it.
Jernigan said that with hindsight he wished he’d tried to bring the bill back up before he left the state House three years later, and that it’s a loophole in the law that needs to be closed.

It affects every part of my life. 
It limits how I move. It limits how I take care of myself. It even limits how I speak. Nothing in my day is simple or automatic. Things most people never think about — getting out of bed, getting dressed, getting to work — require planning, support and determination. 
But cerebral palsy does not define who I am. 
I am married. I have a job. I am going to college. I am building a life. 
If Idaho cuts Medicaid, ripple effects on the budget are likely. Will they drive up costs elsewhere?

I do that here in Idaho, in my community, not behind the walls of an institution, because of Home and Community-Based Services. 
HCBS does not give me something for nothing. It gives me the tools to stand on my own terms. 
With the right supports, I live independently with my wife. I go to work. I take classes. I contribute to my community. I make decisions about my own life. I show up every day and do the hard work required to exist in a world that was not built for my body. 
Without those supports, that life collapses. 
When lawmakers talk about cutting Medicaid and Home and Community-Based Services, they talk about budgets, efficiencies and tradeoffs. What they are really talking about — whether they say it or not — is taking away the freedom of people like me. 
Freedom is not abstract to me. Freedom is being able to live with my spouse. Freedom is holding a job and earning my own paycheck. Freedom is working toward a degree so I can build a better future. Freedom is choosing where I live, who I love and how I participate in my community. 
HCBS makes that freedom possible. 
I already work harder than most people just to exist. I do not ask for pity. I do not ask for special treatment. I ask for the supports that allow me to contribute rather than be sidelined. 
Yes, I need assistance. That is not a failure. It is a fact of my disability. What would be a failure is a system that punishes people for needing help by stripping away the very services that keep them independent. 
Cutting HCBS will not make people with disabilities need less care. It will force us into more restrictive, more expensive and more dehumanizing settings. It will push people out of jobs, out of school and out of community life. It will break families apart and cost the state more in the long run.
But beyond the economics is something deeper. 
I believe in personal responsibility. I believe in hard work. I believe in independence. I live those values every single day. 
And I believe that government should not tread on the lives of people who are doing everything they can to stand on their own. 
For me, HCBS is the difference between freedom and confinement. Between contribution and isolation. Between a future I am building and one that is decided for me. 
I am not a line item. I am not a cost to be minimized. I am an Idahoan who is married, employed, going to college and giving back to my community. 
Do not take that away. 
If Idaho truly values freedom, independence, and individual liberty, then it must protect Home and Community-Based Services. 
Don’t tread on me. 
Don’t tread on my marriage. 
Don’t tread on my work. 
Don’t tread on my education. 
Don’t tread on the life I have fought every day to build.

Alexander Vindman, who played a central role in President Donald Trump’s first impeachment, announced Tuesday that he is the latest Democrat to enter into the race for U.S. Senate against GOP incumbent Ashley Moody.
The 50-year-old Vindman is a 21-year U.S. Army combat veteran who later served as a national security expert working for presidents of both parties. As an infantryman, he was wounded in Iraq and awarded a Purple Heart.
He was working as director of European Affairs for the National Security Council as a top expert on Ukraine when he was swept up in the impeachment hearings against Trump led by congressional House Democrats in 2019. Trump ousted him from his position shortly after the U.S. Senate acquitted the president in that impeachment trial.
Vindman has been living in Broward County since 2023, and stated in an interview with CBS Miami last May that he was considering a run for Senate.
In a campaign video released to announce his candidacy, Vindman says, “This president unleashed a reign of terror and retribution, not just against me and my family, but against all of us.”
“Today, our country is in chaos,” he continues. “Thug militias attacking citizens. Tariffs pushing prices sky-high. Healthcare premiums through the roof. And Florida homeowners are being absolutely screwed because Ashley Moody caved to the big insurance companies. They put Moody in the Senate to be a ‘yes’ vote for Trump and the billionaires. She’s not Florida’s senator. She’s theirs.”
Vindman’s twin brother, Eugene Vindman, was elected to the U.S House of Representatives representing Virginia’s 7th District in November 2024.
Vindman now joins Jacksonville state Rep. Angie Nixon and former Brevard County School Board member Jennifer Jenkins in the race for the Democratic nomination. The primary election takes place on Aug. 18. The winner will take on Moody, who was elected twice statewide as Florida attorney general but has not faced the voters since she was appointed a year ago by Gov.

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-27 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Lexington ousts police chief and adopts policing reforms,Mina Corpuz and Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/27/lexington-ousts-police-chief-and-adopts-policing-reforms/,"Lexington Board of Aldermen meeting Jan. 6, 2026.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Years after turmoil within the Lexington Police Department and allegations surfaced of discriminatory policing practices, excessive force and retaliation against critics, the city has adopted federally recommended reforms and has outed its police chief. 
“These victories demonstrate the power of lawful protest and civic engagement, and they show that our methods are effective. We thank the community for standing together to demand change, and we commend the aldermen for finally heeding the community’s voice,” attorney Jill Collen Jefferson, founder of the legal organization JULIAN, said in a statement. 
JULIAN filed the first lawsuit against the city and police department in 2022 that is scheduled for oral argument before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals next week. Other lawsuits have alleged retaliatory use of force and unlawful detention by the Lexington police. 
The U.S. Department of Justice opened a pattern and practice investigation into the Lexington police in 2023, and less than a year later it released its investigation report detailing the department’s violations of the First, Fourth and 14th Amendments. The DOJ found Lexington police jailed people for unpaid fines without determining whether people could afford to pay, resulting in a “two-tiered system of justice.”
Lexington, located at the edge of the Delta, is majority Black and 30% of the population is in poverty, according to U.S. Census estimates. 
To remedy the constitutional violations, the Justice Department made several recommendations for the city to adopt, which include ensuring that officers who make stops, searches and arrests are authorized to use force with clear direction, have sufficient training and supervision and improve record-keeping to hold officers accountable for inappropriate or unlawful conduct.

The recommendations address issues related to leadership, policing, compliance, accountability and community trust, according to JULIAN. 
In December, Alderman Isaac Lindsey introduced a motion for the city to implement the recommendations, but that came up a vote short, with Mayor Percy Washington and two aldermen forming the majority, according to the legal organization. 
In response to the board’s failure to take action, JULIAN called for a citywide boycott of Lexington’s primary stores, Dollar General and Sunflower. 
JULIAN considers the boycott a success because on Jan. 6, Lindsey reintroduced his motion and the board approved it. Before the vote, several supporters called for the board to implement the DOJ recommendations and put the decision into writing.
“It’s that simple,” said meeting attendee Benita Streeter. “Just put it on there, make a motion, sign off on it, say it in writing so the people will know.”

Another change came the same week when the board called a special meeting and dismissed its police chief, Charles Henderson, an action JULIAN has called for. In his place, former chief Robert Kirklin was appointed as interim leader until the board chooses a new, permanent chief. 
The Board of Aldermen did not provide a reason for Henderson’s departure. But a Jan. 9 letter from the Department of Public Safety’s Office of Standards and Training Special Investigations Unit said Henderson’s law enforcement certification was suspended effective immediately, meaning he is not permitted to hold a law enforcement, emergency telecommunicator or jail detention position. 
“This decision is due to Charles Henderson’s record of conduct or actions that violate the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics and significantly diminish public trust in the competence and reliability of a law enforcement officer,” the letter states. 
Such violations of the code of ethics can result in reprimand, suspension under conditions, recall or cancellation of law enforcement certification, the letter states. 
The referenced violation didn’t take place in Lexington, but in Jackson on Nov. 15, 2024, when Henderson worked for the Jackson Police Department. 
Henderson could not be reached for comment Monday. 
A spokesperson from JULIAN did not have details about the Jackson incident. A spokesperson for the Department of Public Safety was not immediately able to comment Monday due to winter storm-related office closures. 
Policing in Lexington has been the subject of scrutiny since 2022 when a recording was leaked of then Police Chief Sam Dobbins using racial and homophobic slurs when talking about using force while on the job, including the killing of
 13 people. A former Lexington officer had made the recording.
“I shot that n—– 119 times, ok?” said Dobbins, who is white, about the shooting of one person. 
The story made national news, and in July 2022, the aldermen voted 3-2 to terminate Dobbins, which community members celebrated. Former mayor Robin McCrory, who is white, and some aldermen called Dobbins’ statements “locker room talk.” In his place, they appointed Henderson, Dobbins’ second in command, as chief. 
Lexington residents, JULIAN and other advocates continued to attend aldermen meetings and demonstrate against actions of the police department under Henderson, who is Black. 
Jefferson is among those whom Lexington police arrested. She was jailed in 2023 while filming a traffic stop from her car on a public street and spent a weekend in the county facility. A week earlier, Jefferson spoke with Justice Department officials, who visited the city. 
In February 2024, Jefferson was convicted of misdemeanor charges, but days later a Holmes County Justice Court judge rescinded the convictions. 
This is the second time the Civil Rights Division has taken action in Lexington, the Justice Department wrote in its report.  
In 1963, a group of Black residents, now known as the “First Fourteen,” tried to register to vote at the courthouse and were met by the sheriff, other government officials and police. When asked who in the group would be first, Hartman Turnbow said he would die to vote. A group of white men firebombed his home, and Turnbow was falsely arrested and charged with the arson of his home.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Tennessee Republican leader is questioning the FBI director’s comments about the legality of carrying a weapon at a protest after federal agents apparently shot a man to death at a Minneapolis protest.
House Republican Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison pushed back against statements made by FBI Director Kash Patel about the shooting death of Veterans Administration nurse Alex Pretti. Multiple news outlets report Pretti was trying to protect two women and was holding only a cell phone in one hand when he was wrestled to the ground by federal agents, beaten and then shot to death after they found a weapon on him.
Patel said on a Sunday morning talk show, “You cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines to any sort of protest that you want. It’s that simple. You don’t have a right to break the law.” His comments echoed those of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Faison, who isn’t seeking re-election to a ninth term in the General Assembly, took exception to Patel’s statements, saying in a post on X, “Kash you could not be further from the truth. Showing up at a protest is very American. Showing up with a weapon is very American. Freedom loving patriots carry guns. Everywhere. Reference the Boston Tea Party.”
Faison said Monday he wasn’t sure if his sentiments match those of other Republicans and added, “but I do know 100% that the Bill of Rights is not up for debate regardless of who is in power. Some things transcend political parties and should be sacred.”
He appears to be among a number of Republicans nationally, though, who are raising questions about the incident in Minneapolis, where protests are growing daily as federal agents carry out a massive operation to deport immigrants without permanent legal documentation of citizenship.

Pretti’s death on top of the Jan. 7 shooting of Renee Good by an agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also in Minneapolis, is leading Democrats to refuse to vote for increased funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Minneapolis mayor demanded the federal government end the ICE and Border Security buildup in the city.
The shooting response also led gun-rights groups to criticize the Trump administration when Noem said, “I don’t know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign,” a precursor to Patel’s statement.
The Gun Owners Caucus of Minnesota said Patel was “completely incorrect” about Minnesota state law and pointed out permit holders aren’t prohibited from carrying guns with extra ammunition at protests or rallies.
The FBI defended Patel by saying he was talking about the practicality of showing up at a protest with a weapon.
But the Gun Owners Caucus of Minnesota said Pretti was a lawful gun owner and carry permit holder, according to local officials. The group demanded an investigation by state and federal authorities.
“Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms – including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights. These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed, and they must be respected and protected at all times,” the group said in a statement.

(Product image courtesy of Novo Nordisk; Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Are GLP-1 drugs prescribed for weight loss becoming too outsized a line item for continued coverage through the state Medicaid program? That’s what Gov. Dan McKee’s fiscal year 2027 budget suggests.
Medicaid costs roughly quadrupled between the start of fiscal year 2024 and the end of fiscal year 2025 in per-member monthly payments to Medicaid managed care plans, according to the state’s Executive Office of Health and Human Services, which administers Rhode Island’s Medicaid program.
The agency’s September budget request to the governor’s office attributed the increased use of expensive weight-loss meds with brand names like Wegovy, Zepbound and Saxenda to an explosive rise in demand. 
Removing GLP-1s from Rhode Island’s Medicaid formulary for weight loss would save $6.3 million in general revenue, according to McKee’s proposed budget introduced on Jan. 15. Coverage of the drugs for weight loss would end on Oct. 1 under McKee’s plan. Medicaid recipients prescribed GLP-1s for diabetes would not be affected by the proposal.
The drugs have shown remarkable efficacy in treating obesity in addition to their utility in controlling Type 2 diabetes. Patients in large clinical trials for GLP-1s lost an average of 15% to 20% of their body weight, depending on the drug they were given.
But the drugs are considered optional in Medicaid programs; the feds do not demand that states ensure coverage.
“While quite efficacious, these medications are quite expensive, with list prices ranging from $12,000 annually to roughly $16,000 annually as of March 2025,” according to the September budget request from the state’s health and human services office.
According to a KFF analysis, as of November 2025, Rhode Island was one of only 13 states to cover GLP-1s for obesity through Medicaid. States which previously had coverage — such as California, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and South Carolina — have also eliminated GLP-1 coverage for weight loss in recent months.
Rhode Island considers ending Medicaid coverage of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss

Kerri White, a spokesperson for the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, said that McKee’s initiative is the same policy suggestion the agency offered in its requested budget last fall. But the ultimate savings could change depending on new enrollment data and pricing when state budget crunchers meet in May.
“This is mostly an administrative change to contracts and rates,” White wrote in an email, noting the drugs would be struck from the preferred drug list. There would be no grandfathering or exemptions for existing patients, she added.
In state fiscal year 2025, there were 24,971 prescriptions for GLP-1s for obesity for Rhode Island Medicaid beneficiaries, although duplicates may lurk in those numbers as patients can switch medications or change doses, White noted.
Biggest breakthrough since statins
GLP-1s are classed as receptor agonists, or drugs that activate at specific receptors in the body. They help raise insulin and suppress the hormone glucagon, which plays a role in both appetite and Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, they slow gastric emptying, which means people feel full longer and ultimately eat less. 
The GLP-1s mimic the body’s hormonal pathways, amplifying signals the body already uses to communicate things like hunger and fullness. And the GLP-1s tend to follow a more sophisticated script compared to older weight-loss drugs like anorectics, most of which are essentially stimulants or amphetamine derivatives. Anorectics came with much larger menus of side-effects, such as the notorious Fen-Phen, yanked from the market in 1997 after worries about heart valve damage.
The GLP-1s are indeed special, says Dr. Amy Nunn, executive director of the Rhode Island Public Health Institute and a professor at Brown University’s School of Public Health.
“There hasn’t been a medical innovation that’s been this impactful, really, since the advent of statins,” Nunn said in a phone interview, referring to the cholesterol-lowering drugs that premiered in 1987 and were prescribed to an estimated 92 million Americans in 2018 and 2019. 
Nunn, also the CEO of Providence’s LGBTQ-friendly community clinic Open Door Health and a State House regular for her testimony on bills promoting healthy eating and lifestyle changes, is displeased with McKee’s bid to axe the drugs from the Medicaid lineup, calling it an “all or nothing proposal.”
“That’s not the way to address a big public health problem,” Nunn said. “The big elephant in the room is the medications are too expensive.”
The GLP-1 market has ballooned in recent years, as drugmakers race to find new variants and thereby seize a piece of a lucrative industry. The GLP-1 that is often used as shorthand for the entire drug family — Ozempic — is officially indicated only for Type 2 diabetes, though it remains prescribed off-label even after its now-numerous sibling drugs entered the market.  
The drugs have proven to be remarkable cash cows for their manufacturers. Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharma giant responsible for both Ozempic and Wegovy, had a market cap of $570 billion in 2023, larger than the economy of its home country Denmark. The same year, the company paid a $2.12 billion tax bill, more than any other Danish taxpayer. (The company endured new woes, and cut 9,000 jobs in 2025, however, partly due to increasing competition.)

Why not team up with other states for better pricing?
Strange bedfellows tend to congregate in the shadows of drugmakers’ towering profits. Nunn — who fought last year against President Donald Trump’s administration in federal court over research funding cuts — said the Oval Office made the right choice in its recent challenge to drugmaker profits. 
“I think what President Trump has done is commendable, because so many people need those medications, and he’s right that they are making too much money, and people can’t get the medications that they need,” Nunn said.  
Nunn added that Trump’s strong-arming pharma giants may have been “for political reasons, because older Americans are more likely to vote. But I think it was a bold and much needed policy move,” she said.










That’s not the way to address a big public health problem. The big elephant in the room is the medications are too expensive.


–  Dr. Amy Nunn, executive director of the Rhode Island Public Health Institute and a professor at Brown University’s School of Public Health


Nunn said that patients tend to gain weight back if they go off the medications, and that McKee’s plan leaves patients without a transition plan in place. 
Nunn said Rhode Island should form purchasing partnerships with bigger states like Massachusetts or California to get better prices from the pharmaceutical industry.  
“This is what they did for hepatitis medications, and they did for other medications,” Nunn said. “This is what the VA does. So that’s what needs to happen.” 
She continued: “ We don’t have to accept those prices. We can challenge pharmaceutical companies about their prices rather than cutting off patients.”
Health disparities and long-term impact
Higher rates of obesity are observed among low-income Rhode Islanders and communities of color. The adult obesity rate is about 31% statewide, but almost 36.8% among non-Hispanic Black and  36.1% among Hispanic Rhode Islanders. Non-Hispanic white adults have an obesity rate of 30.3%, according to CDC data. 
Additionally, 2022 state data showed Rhode Islanders in households earning under $25,000 have an obesity rate of almost 36%, while those earning more above $50,000 sit at 28.3%.   
Ending obesity coverage for GLP-1 obesity drugs could improve the state’s finances but might also “result in health inequities and less comprehensive coverage,” the state’s health and human services agency acknowledged in its September budget request.

The economics of GLP-1s have undergone several heavy-duty studies and overviews, including one in October 2024 by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office, which suggested the cost of the drugs could still exceed the savings from treating obesity and its attendant health conditions. Additionally, the drugs could increase the government’s net spending on Medicare, through at least 2044. 
The budget office estimated about $35 billion in increased net costs from 2026 to 2034, noting healthier Medicare members would not offset the overall costs. 
“Relative to the direct costs of the medications, total savings from beneficiaries’ improved health would be small — less than $50 million in 2026 and rising to $1.0 billion in 2034,” the report noted.
Another 2025 survey published in JAMA Health Forum noted that, should Medicare pay for the drugs, it could avoid spending a hypothetical $18.2 billion on obesity-related health expenditures over 10 years — while dishing out $65.9 billion annually on the GLP-1s by year 10, thereby negating any savings. 
The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review deemed GLP-1s lacking in cost effectiveness for obesity management in 2022. The market had changed enough by the time the institute revisited the topic in 2025 and found some drugs cost-effective at certain prices and formulations.
The institute recommended that existing GLP-1 makers, “and those with products in the pipeline, should consider steep discounts to prices in exchange for higher volume.” 
“What has to happen is we have to move from a low-volume, high-price business model, to a high-volume, low-price business model,” Nunn said. “The marginal cost of producing a little more of medications is very small.”
“The pharmaceutical industry, they hem and haw about how they won’t make money, and they have made, like, a trillion dollars on these products,” Nunn continued. “And so that’s just silly.” 
McKee’s proposal will undergo months of legislative questioning, editing and restructuring before the General Assembly’s final version emerges sometime in June. The new fiscal year begins July 1.

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Last year, the West Virginia Legislature passed a law to require public and charter schools, public colleges and universities to display a “durable poster or framed copy of the United States motto, In God We Trust.”
They used the fact that it’s the United States motto to get it into schools, but their intention was actually to start to blur the line between church and state.
Sen. Mike Azinger, R-Wood, had sponsored the bill for three years in a row until it passed last year. He said he wanted “to give honor to God for this bill. … If America stays with that motto in our hearts and West Virginia stays with that motto in our hearts, we’ll be OK.”
Now, Senate Republicans have introduced a bill to require a Robert Aitken Bible in all 4th, 8th and 10th grade social studies classrooms in public and charters schools.
Senate Bill 388 is sponsored by Sens. Amy Grady, R-Mason; Darren Thorne, R-Hampshire; Vince Deeds, R-Greenbrier; Craig A. Hart, R-Mingo; Rollan A. Roberts, R-Raleigh; T. Kevan Bartlett, R-Kanawha; and Eric Tarr, R-Putnam. The bill states that “No public funds may be used for this purpose,” and that schools can accept and use private donations to purchase the Aitken Bible, which retails for more than $200.
The bill doesn’t explain why they specifically want the Aitken Bible, so I looked into it.
There’s a movement across the country by Christian nationalists to use the Aitken Bible — the first English-language translation of the Bible printed in the United States in 1782 — to erode the separation of church and state. 
Aitken’s Bible was the only edition of the Bible ever endorsed by Congress — but it wasn’t because of the spiritual beliefs of the Founding Fathers.
The Continental Congress endorsed it because the publication of Aitken’s Bible aimed to emphasize “the country’s burgeoning cultural identity detached from that of Britain’s,” according to Library of Congress Librarian Marianna Stell.
The Aitken Bible was considered a flop. Publisher Robert Aitken wrote a letter to George Washington saying that he lost money printing his Bible because people continued to buy cheap imported Bibles after the Revolutionary War.
Aitken asked Congress to provide money for him to print his Bible and to purchase copies — it did neither. He also asked Congress to give him exclusive rights to publish the Bible for the next 14 years — Congress said no to that as well.
There were also false claims that the Aitken Bible was named the “Bible of the Revolution” and that U.S. soldiers carried it into battle against the British. 
Because Congress endorsed the Aitken Bible years before the First Amendment was adopted, some people — including Christian nationalists — point to it as a reason that the First Amendment does not call for the separation of church and state.
A 1962 U.S. Supreme Court ruling found school-sponsored prayer violated the First Amendment Establishment Clause, which says the government cannot establish a religion or favor one religion over another. 
Constitutional scholars point out and the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld that the establishment clause and free exercise clause ( do indeed establish a separation of church and state. Even Thomas Jefferson, in a 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptist Association, wrote that when the American people adopted the establishment clause they built a “wall of separation between the church and state.”
These Christian nationalist groups presented copies of the Aitken Bible to politicians in Tennessee before lawmakers there named it one of Tennessee’s first official state books. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported that all West Virginian legislators and Supreme Court justices were also given copies with their names on it last week.
Stephen Skelton is the founder of both the Aitken Bible Historical Foundation and the First American Bible Project. He has said the group aims to provide the Bible to schools and lawmakers as a historical resource — however he has also used the Aitken Bible to back up his skepticism about the separation of church and state. 
“How could our founding fathers have believed in a separation of church and state if I have a Bible approved by Congress?” Skelton said in video clips posted to the First American Bible Project’s social media. “There needs to be a reconciliation between these two arguments.”
Ryan Jayne, senior policy counsel at the Freedom From Religion Foundation, told USA Today that while Tennessee’s law is “mostly symbolic,” he thinks it “ violates the spirit of the First Amendment and also the Tennessee State Constitution, which says that no preference shall be given to any religious establishment or mode of worship.”
“I think there is an intent to favor Christianity, but they are trying to couch this in a historical context,” Jayne said. “…They wanted to include (this book) to try to go along with this myth that the Founders intended to create a Christian country.”
Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, told USA Today that the promotion of the Aitken Bible as a state book is, “without a doubt,” a violation of the First Amendment.
“It doesn’t matter whether the Bible is one of 10 or the only official state book,” Laser said. “It’s still a flagrant violation of church and state separation, because it’s placing the government’s favor on one religion and favoring one religious belief — and frankly, even one type of belief system within Christianity, because not everyone uses that Bible. That is a violation of our federal and your state’s constitutional religious freedom protections.”
The Senate Education Committee approved SB 388, sending it to the full Senate for consideration. It’s still in the early stages and may not go anywhere, but remember that lawmakers got “In God we trust” posters in schools last year. They will keep trying to pass these laws that may not seem like a big deal, but those laws will add up until there’s no longer a separation of church and state in West Virginia public schools.

Glenn Youngkin’s veto pen — as they test whether Virginia’s new Democratic governor, Abigail Spanberger, will take a more favorable view of firearm restrictions.
Over nearly four hours, the Democratic-led Senate Courts of Justice Committee approved more than half a dozen bills tightening rules on assault-style firearms, gun storage, concealed carry reciprocity, ghost guns and weapons in public spaces, while rejecting the lone Republican proposal that would have increased mandatory minimum sentences for repeat firearm offenses. 
All of the votes fell along party lines.
The meeting came exactly one week after hundreds of gun rights activists gathered around Capitol Square on Martin Luther King Jr. Day for the annual Lobby Day rally, where speakers warned that Democrats were reviving an aggressive gun control agenda after several years of vetoes under Youngkin. 
That rally drew a larger crowd than recent years, reflecting heightened tension as Democrats now control the governor’s office and both chambers of the General Assembly.
Because of time constraints, the committee did not take up an additional package of gun-related proposals that remain pending.
Philip Van Cleave, president of the gun rights group Virginia Citizens Defence League, sharply criticized the committee’s actions, arguing that Democrats were targeting lawful gun owners rather than violent offenders. 
“While Democrats have bills to weaken laws on violent criminals, they like and support every bill that in any way infringes on the ability of law-abiding citizens to protect themselves,” Van Cleave said in an email Monday afternoon. 
“For years Democrats said, ‘No one wants to take your guns, we just want reasonable gun control.’ They do want to take our guns away, and the committee reported out bills that do just that with the most popular long guns in America. There is only one reason that a government would want a disarmed population, and that’s to force their will upon that population.”
 Assault weapons and large-capacity magazines

On a 9-5 party-line vote, the committee approved Senate Bill 749, sponsored by Sen. Saddam Azlan Salim, D-Fairfax, which would prohibit the importation, sale, manufacture, purchase, possession or transfer of assault firearms and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, with limited exceptions.
The bill would create Class 1 misdemeanor penalties but would not retroactively criminalize firearms already legally owned. 
Assault firearms manufactured before July 1, 2026, would be exempt, along with antique firearms, permanently inoperable weapons and manually operated firearms. Exceptions would also apply to law enforcement, military use and certain transfers between immediate family members.
“Currently, there are so many assault weapons in circulation. This approach will gradually take the weapons off the street without retroactively making it a crime to own a weapon that was legally purchased,” Salim said.
Opponents framed the bill as unconstitutional.
“That’s the purpose of the Second Amendment. That’s why we have firearms — to fight against a tyrannical government,” said Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg. “And this bill is a direct infringement on the Second Amendment to fight against a tyrannical government.”
Southwest Virginia resident Carla Poff, speaking against the bill, said, “I find this to be a blank violation of our Second Amendment.”
Supporters countered that similar laws have survived legal challenges. 
Lori Haas of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions noted that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld Maryland’s stricter assault weapons ban. “I think we’re in good standing constitutionally,” Haas said.
 Firearms in public college buildings

The committee also advanced SB 272 by Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, limiting where firearms may be carried in buildings owned or leased by the commonwealth, including public colleges and universities.
The bill narrows an existing exemption so that firearms would be allowed in higher-education buildings only for approved curricular or institutional activities, such as ROTC programs. Violations would be misdemeanors.
“This bill has been introduced three times, in 2023, 2024, 2025. This is the fourth time,” Deeds said. “It’s passed the Senate, all three times, it passed both houses, and was vetoed.”
Deeds first introduced the legislation following the 2022 University of Virginia shooting that killed three students.
Opponents argued the measure would leave students vulnerable. “Students have a right to self defense,” said Eric Nolen, who spoke against the bill.
 Safe storage in homes

Lawmakers approved SB 348, sponsored by Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, requiring firearms and ammunition to be stored in locked containers when a minor or prohibited person is present in the residence. Violations would be a Class 4 misdemeanor, and dealers would be required to post notices explaining the law.
“Every single time I’m carrying this bill, there has been a fatality of a small child,” Boysko said, citing recent shootings involving children in Newport News, Chesterfield County and Norfolk. 
Previous iterations of the bill had twice been vetoed by Youngkin.
 Assault weapons in public spaces

The committee passed SB 312 by Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, expanding Virginia’s prohibition on carrying certain semi-automatic firearms in public places, including streets and parks.
“This was inspired by an incident at the Old Town Farmer’s Market,” Ebbin said, referring to people openly carrying assault-style firearms in Alexandria. 
He also cited the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right rally and research showing higher casualty rates in mass shootings involving such weapons.
Opponents argued the bill is overly broad. Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, said it would criminalize most modern pistols and “would not last five minutes under any constitutional scrutiny.”
 Ghost guns and unserialized firearms

On another party-line vote, lawmakers advanced SB 323, also sponsored by Ebbin, targeting so-called ghost guns and unfinished firearm components. The bill would prohibit manufacturing, selling or possessing unserialized firearms or unfinished frames and receivers, with delayed effective dates to allow compliance.
“This bill is about keeping guns out of the hands of children, or people prohibited from guns, and traffickers,” Ebbin said.
John Weber of the National Rifle Association argued the bill is unworkable, saying, “There is no process set up to acquire a serial number for a firearm.”
 Firearms left in vehicles and concealed carry reciprocity

The committee approved SB 496, sponsored by Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, requiring handguns left in unattended vehicles to be stored in locked, hard-sided containers out of view.
“This is where young people are getting these guns,” Marsden said, citing thefts from vehicles as a major source of illegal firearms.
Republicans warned the bill could criminalize victims of theft. Sen. Glenn Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, said it “essentially criminalizes behavior when someone has been robbed.”
Lawmakers also passed SB 115, sponsored by Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax, tightening Virginia’s recognition of concealed handgun permits issued by other states.
“Basically it says you can’t just go down to Texas and pay a couple bucks and then get a concealed weapon permit all around Virginia,” said Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, the committee chair.
 Republican bill rejected

The committee defeated SB 78, sponsored by Sen. Danny Diggs, R-York, which would have increased mandatory minimum sentences for repeat firearm offenses.
“What deters crime is knowing you’re going to get caught,” Surovell said, arguing harsher penalties alone are ineffective.
Most of the Democratic-backed bills now head to the Senate Finance Committee to determine their fiscal impact.

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)Legislation is advancing through the General Assembly to restrict future data centers to industrially zoned areas.
Several of the bills are aimed at helping localities manage the industry as well as temper community concerns over environmental impacts, sound, and viewshed issues around data centers. One bill looks to place data centers near manufacturers and warehouses – far away from commercial and residential communities.
“What we’re trying to have happen is have localities acknowledge that data centers, especially in the modern day, are not the way that they were just 10 years ago,” Sen. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, said in a local government committee meeting. “But the modern data centers today that are being built up, especially for AI, are industrial use and they need to be classified as such.”
Roem is the sponsor of Senate Bill 94, which has faced pushback from the data center industry and electrical workers unions. The bill does not stop communities from rezoning areas to be industrial in order to make more space for data centers. Localities often require setbacks and buffers when an industrial zone borders a residential area.
Roem’s district, which includes parts of Prince William County, is home to over 60 data centers. A recent move to rezone agricultural areas near Manassas National Battlefield for the controversial Digital Gateway data center project is caught up in a court battle.
The 2024 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission report on data centers stated that the state should allow localities to manage their own ordinances and siting for the industry. But Roem said that since the report’s release localities have been slow to pass ordinances, and community concern around where data centers are allowed has increased. She said the price of land in her district is skyrocketing due to the data center industry and the energy needed to be built to power them.
“You basically have data centers outbidding residential developers in much of Northern Virginia … It has localities looking at, will we be able to actually approve residential rezoning for future projects? Will we be able to use the grid, be able to handle that capacity,” said Andrew Clark, vice president of government affairs for the Home Builders Association of Virginia.
The Home Builders Association did not take a stance on the bill, but did answer a question to the committee posed by Roem.
The data center industry is not a fan of the bill. Nicole Riley with the Data Center Coalition testified against the bill, saying it unfairly targets one industry over other large projects. She pointed to Senate Bill 130 by Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, that allows localities to require environmental and sound impact studies to be done before approving permits for data centers. 
“We believe this is the best approach to address the need for localities to have more tools when approving permits related to projects for high energy use facilities,” Riley said in committee.
The bill was referred to Senate Finance for further consideration with a vote of 8-5 with one abstention.

Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, said an investigation is warranted because VMI’s board did not renew the contract of Ret. General Cedric Wins, the institution’s first Black superintendent, and because of unresolved issues following a 2021 investigation that found persistent disparities, cultural barriers, and a lack of accountability.
“For those of us, like me, who care deeply about service and care deeply about producing leaders of character, we need to ensure that VMI (has turned the page),” said Helmer. 
“This task force offers a real opportunity to ensure we are inspiring leaders of character who understand the importance of the United States, who understand the history of Virginia, and reject rebellion against the United States, all the more important, at a time when we have a president of the United States and others who seem uninterested in the Constitution of the United States.” 
Opposition emerged during the legislative process. Ret. Lt. Gen. David Furness, VMI’s superintendent, voiced concerns about the bill during an appearance before the House Studies Subcommittee on Jan. 23. 
He pointed to VMI’s honor system and progress on equity audit recommendations, noting that 34 out of 38 changes have been completed, and objected to claims that VMI’s leadership supports the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.
“It is hard for me to understand how the institution lauded for its leadership model by so many notable state and national leaders could be described by the patron of this bill as committed to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy,” Furness said. 
“That may have been true of VMI in the past. It is not now, nor will it be in the future.”
The subcommittee, which Helmer chairs, voted 4-1 to send the proposal to the House Rules Committee. House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, cast the lone dissenting vote. .
Helmer’s House Bill 22 had not yet been docketed with the House Education Committee, as of Monday at noon. The proposal would align VMI with standard policies used at other public universities regarding disciplinary immunity for students who report acts of sexual violence.
Helmer said it is critical to understand how VMI is responding to the General Assembly’s concerns, particularly around racism, sexism, sexual assault, educational outcomes, and leadership development.
Separately, the House Education Committee is expected to consider House Bill 1374, which would dissolve VMI’s governing board and transfer oversight to Virginia State University’s Board of Visitors. 
Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, the bill’s patron, said the proposal is intended as a structural — not punitive — response to longstanding governance concerns. 
“The bill reflects broader, longstanding concerns about whether VMI’s current governance structure meets the standards the commonwealth expects,” Feggans said in a Jan. 21 statement. “When patterns of governance issues arise, it is appropriate for the General Assembly to review and, if necessary, adjust oversight structures.”
He added that the proposal “strengthens oversight, clarifies accountability, and ensures that VMI can focus on its core mission while operating under a governance framework that meets modern expectations for a public institution.”
If the measures clear the House, they would move to the Senate before heading to Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s desk, marking the next steps in the legislative process.
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, a graduate of both VMI and Virginia State University, has been a vocal critic of the institution’s leadership. However, she said she played no role in the drafting of the legislation.
“Unequivocally, no,” Carroll Foy said. “I had no idea that these bills were drafted, or that anyone was contemplating drafting these bills. I was never consulted about it. I wasn’t even aware that these bills existed until reporters started asking and inquiring about the bill.”
Carroll Foy said VMI’s current predicament stems from decisions made under former Gov. Glenn Youngkin, past governing board members, and the Spirit of VMI PAC. 
She said confidence has eroded among many lawmakers because those parties failed in their fiduciary duties and engaged in partisan political disputes over the institution’s leadership and direction.
Despite that history, Carroll Foy described VMI as an “extraordinary place for extraordinary people” and said she believes the institution and Board of Visitors can “turn a page on the path and be forward-looking and produce some of the best citizen soldiers in this country.”
Sherry L. Wallace, a VMI spokeswoman, said in a statement, “We are reviewing all recently filed bills and plan to work with our elected officials to demonstrate VMI’s continued progress and ongoing value to the commonwealth of Virginia. VMI is defined by an uncompromising honor system that is more fair, equitable, and transparent today than at any intime of the Institute’s 186-year history. The citizen-soldiers the Institute educates are the epitome of value, and we plan to continue that mission.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The program began as a bipartisan idea: to incentivize cities and towns to change their zoning codes and approve more housing developments.
But three years after the launch of the state-funded, $5 million New Hampshire Housing Champions program, that bipartisan support has crumbled. 
Facing projected revenue shortfalls, lawmakers stopped funding the program in the 2025 budget, but allowed it to disburse the remainder of its funds to cities and towns. This year, they are moving to stop those funds entirely.
The House Housing Committee voted, 10-8, on Jan. 20 to recommend ending the Housing Champions program and potentially redirect the remaining money back into the state’s general fund. House Bill 1196 passed along party lines, with Democrats opposed. 
If signed into law, the bill could result in up to $2.6 million of funds that have already been obligated to cities and towns to be halted and redirected, depending on how the bill is interpreted, according to a fiscal note to the bill by the Department of Business and Economic Affairs.
Some Republicans moving to end the program say it should never have been created, contending it allows for political favoritism by the state. Other Republicans said the program is too expensive to continue, at a time when state agencies are being forced to cut back other programs amid lower business tax revenues. 
“This is a bad program, we can’t afford it, and we should end it,” said Rep. Matt Drew, a Manchester Republican and the sponsor of the bill. 
Democrats opposed the bill and called the program a valuable tool in the fight to reduce the state’s persistent shortage of housing.
“(The bill) removes one of the few incentives we have in this state to spur creative local solutions at a time when families across our state are struggling with rising rents, limited inventory, and barriers to affordable home ownership,” said Rep. David Preece, a Manchester Democrat who said the bill would send “the wrong signal” about housing.
Passed in the 2023 budget and supported by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, the Housing Champions program allows cities and towns to apply to the Department of Business and Economic Affairs to be designated as “Housing Champions.” Getting that designation requires the municipality to take a number of pro-housing actions, such as creating workforce housing districts, adopting an inclusionary zoning ordinance, lowering minimum lot sizes for new houses, implementing sewer or water improvements, conducting training for planning board members, and more. The department awards the designation based on a scoring matrix for each action.
There are financial incentives: Towns declared champions are eligible for state funding to support infrastructure projects, like expanding or upgrading water and sewer lines, and per-unit production grants awarded after the completion of housing projects. 
The 2023 budget dedicated $5 million of state funds toward those incentive grants. In 2024, 18 cities and towns achieved Housing Champion status, according to the Department of Business and Economic Affairs. Those include Boscawen, Concord, Derry, Dover, Enfield, Farmington, Hinsdale, Hooksett, Jaffrey, Keene, Lebanon, Manchester, Nashua, Newport, Portsmouth, Rochester, Salem, and Somersworth. 
To supporters, the program acts as both a financial motivator for reforms and a fact-checking mechanism on cities and towns that claim to have pro-housing ordinances already. 
“It’s a good way for folks to, or communities, to audit what their existing regulatory structure looks like,” said Nick Taylor, executive director of New Hampshire Housing Action, which opposes the repeal bill. “And if they’re running into barrier after barrier, you’re helping them identify that they are not a housing champion, even if they may like to claim that they are.” 
But Drew argued last week the program improperly inserts the state into decision-making that should be made at the local level. 
He also said the program allows the Department of Business and Economic Affairs to pick winners and losers among the towns it honors, and that the funds themselves could allow towns to use state money to reward developers. Both possibilities are an inappropriate use of state funds, he said.
“The issue there is that we’re essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul,” he said. “We’re taking state funds from taxpayers all around the state, and we’re funding specific projects for specific cities because they jumped through the hoops to meet the requirements of this program.”
Democrats disagreed, saying the Housing Champions process works like any state grant award program in which state agencies inevitably use discretion. 
“Do you assume that all grant programs are essentially grants for politically favored applicants?” asked Rep. Merryl Gibbs, a Concord Democrat. Drew replied yes. 
Should the bill pass the House and Senate and be signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte, it is not clear whether it would immediately halt the release of any funds already promised to cities and towns, or simply freeze future funding. Asked about those possibilities, Drew said he did not know but that he would favor stopping the pending payouts. 
The proposed end to the program comes after the Legislature passed a slate of laws in 2025 designed to restrict cities and towns from implementing zoning codes that might limit housing. That included laws requiring municipalities to allow residential development in commercial zones, with some exceptions; restricting the number of parking spaces a municipality can mandate for larger developments; and requiring municipalities to allow detached accessory dwelling units by right. Another law creates an expedited, 60-day state permitting process for large developers who pay a fee.
The 2025 package of pro-housing laws did not include an increase in state funding; in addition to stopping more funding to the Housing Champions program, legislators also declined to increase the $5 million annual amount dedicated to the Affordable Housing Fund, which is paid for by a portion of the real estate transfer tax. 
Some Republicans argued that lack of funding is intentional.
“This committee has already done yeoman’s work, in my opinion, on moving the needle in the housing industry, and we haven’t put a single dollar behind that,” said Rep. Joe Alexander, a Hooksett Republican and the chairman of the Housing Committee. “Because New Hampshire is very creative with how we fund things, but we also are very creative on what we spend things on.” 
For Alexander, the end of the program is personal: In 2023, he was one of its architects. “The Housing Champion program is one of my babies,” he said last week, adding that he had initially opposed the bill when he saw it. 
But he said after giving it more thought, he concluded that the state’s polices have moved on toward encouraging development through deregulation. 
“I think it’s going to be a huge, way bigger of a difference than the money that we’re putting in here,” he said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/housingwarner-1024x684.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 05:57:25.204578

(Photos courtesy of the Arkansas Secretary of State)Republican and unaffiliated party voters in Arkansas’ Senate District 26 can begin casting ballots Tuesday with the start of early voting for the special primary runoff election.
Early voting will run on weekdays until Feb. 2. The runoff itself is Feb. 3.
The special runoff pits Wade Dunn, a retired businessman, against Brad Simon, a small business owner. The winner will go on to represent the GOP in the special general election on March 3 against independent candidate Adam Watson.
Dunn received the most votes during the Jan. 6 special primary, but did not receive the majority needed to avoid a runoff against Simon, who finished second.
The special election to fill the seat previously held by Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch, who died in September, has had its fair share of controversy already.
Republicans’ Arkansas Senate seat runoff campaign a sprint to prove who opposes prison project more

Senate District 26 contains the 815-acre plot where Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders wants to build a 3,000-bed prison — a prospect that has not gone over well with many in the predominantly Republican district that encompasses parts of Franklin, Logan, Johnson and Sebastian counties. Stubblefield had been an outspoken opponent of the prison project.
Sanders’ decision to schedule the special election in June — after legislators are set to return to Little Rock for its legislative session in April, where they are expected to debate funding the prison’s construction — spawned a lawsuit and legal order that forced her to move the election to March.
All five of the Republicans in the primary earlier this month opposed building the prison in Franklin County, including Dunn and Simon.

The think tank analysis of the numbers comes after more than a decade in which the state’s Republican leaders have diverted billions from taxpayers to wealthy interests on promises that it would create jobs.
The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services on Friday released employment figures for December. 
It said the state added just 3,500 jobs in the last month of 2025, and that the unemployment rate remained stuck at 4.5%, which continues to rank in the bottom half of states.
Those who stop seeking work aren’t counted in the unemployment rate because they’re not considered part of the labor force. 
Rea S. Hederman Jr., vice president of policy at the Buckeye Institute, said more Ohioans need to join the labor force and more private-sector jobs need to be added.
“With national job gains slowing, Ohio’s sluggish private-sector job growth is not surprising,” Hederman said in a written statement. 
“And while the unemployment rate is strong by historical measures, more Ohioans need to be in the job market, and more jobs need to be created if Ohio, its communities, and its workers are going to thrive.”
Ohio’s job market is dragging after decades of exploding inequality across the United States. 
The nonpartisan Rand Corporation last year reported that if the bottom 90% of Americans’ share of national income had remained what it was in 1975 (66%), that group would have gotten $80 trillion more by 2023. 
The group comprising 9 in 10 Americans would have gotten $3.9 trillion more — or $13,000 for every person regardless of age or employment status — in 2023 alone, the analysis said.
Molly Bryden, a researcher at Policy Matters Ohio, said some of that inequality is showing up in Ohio’s most recent jobs report.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The accommodation and food service sector saw steep losses overall in 2025, shedding 9,500 jobs in the past year,” she said in a written statement. 
“Uneven growth in the service industry overall implicates growing income inequality among working Ohioans. Employment in higher-paying professions in professional and business services grew by 13,100 in 2025, coinciding with the hiring slowdown for lower-wage jobs in accommodation and food services.”
Bryden added that inequality itself is helping to drag down the economy.
“Losses in accommodation and food service jobs could indicate that rising prices have generated challenges for businesses to maintain hiring levels, along with lower demand for accommodation and food services among Ohio families, as inflation continues to strain household budgets,” she said. 
“Persistent weakness in the accommodation and food service sector — an important economic driver — could have spillover effects, further stalling Ohio’s economic growth.”
There appears to be a strong political imperative to ease economic inequality. 
A YouGov poll taken this month found that 80% of respondents believed that the gap between rich and poor is a very big or somewhat big problem. 
That view commanded majorities across the ideological and political spectrum. 
Despite those views, however, Ohio’s Republican leadership has used claims of job creation to redistribute taxpayer dollars upward since John Kasich became governor in 2011. 
He led the creation of JobsOhio that year. The entity claims to be a private corporation even though it was created by the state government and allowed to lease the state’s liquor franchise for less than it was worth.
JobsOhio now has a large, well-paid staff, and it’s passed out more than $1 billion in what used to be state dollars to private corporations. But the agency’s leaders have struggled to prove that its activities have created any jobs.
In 2013, the Republican-led legislature created a tax break for limited liability corporations, again on claims that it, too, would create jobs. 
It’s costing the state more than $1 billion a year, with the bulk of the benefit going to the wealthy. But its supporters can’t show that it’s delivered on its job-creation promises.
The LLC tax break is part of $12 billion in annual tax cuts tilted in favor of the wealthy, Policy Matters Ohio reported last year.
The latest jobs report might be seen as evidence that those cuts and JobsOhio have been ineffective. 
So could the fact that the Ohio Department of Development expects the state’s population to decline by 675,000 by 2050.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)PORTLAND, Ore. — Keith Ellison held up his cellphone. The Minnesota attorney general was onstage in an Oregon theater in front of hundreds of people, accompanied by four of his Democratic peers from other states, to mark a year of coordinated legal strategy to resist the Trump administration’s expansive use of executive power.
“Can I just note, real quickly, that we need everybody to use these things?” Ellison said to the audience, which earlier had greeted the out-of-state attorney general with a standing ovation. “They have been remarkably helpful.”
Ellison and his fellow Democratic attorneys general were sitting onstage last week at Revolution Hall, a music venue most evenings. Over the past year, AGs have emerged as unlikely rock stars of legal resistance to President Donald Trump, who has made broad use of presidential authority on immigration enforcement and a wide range of other issues, unchecked by the majority-Republican Congress.
Cellphone video has emerged as a powerful rebuttal to Trump’s version of events, at a time when the federal government has restricted state and local investigators from accessing potential evidence to pursue their own investigations into excessive force and fatal shootings by immigration agents in their jurisdictions.
Footage, documents at odds with DHS accounts of immigration enforcement incidents

On Saturday, witnesses with cellphone cameras recorded federal agents in Minneapolis shooting and killing Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who, like many in the city, was recording how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents interact with the public during enforcement activity. The video evidence of Pretti’s killing was captured by coordinated but loosely organized bands of ordinary citizens using their cellphones.
The images, shared widely on social media, directly contradict official accounts, including claims by U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who accused Pretti of attacking agents. Bystander video shows Pretti filming with his cellphone before multiple agents tackled him to the ground, beat him, and then shot him to death after taking his gun. Pretti, who was licensed to carry a gun in public in Minnesota, never drew his weapon.
Two weeks earlier in Minneapolis, cellphone cameras captured from multiple angles the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an immigration agent. A week after that in nearby St. Paul, Minnesota, cellphone video showed armed immigration agents forcing ChongLy Scott Thao, a middle-aged naturalized U.S. citizen, from his home and into subfreezing temperatures while he was wearing only underwear and sandals.
There are “a whole lot more stories,” Ellison said, many caught on mobile phones or dashboard cameras, and all demonstrating the forceful tactics being used by some of the more than 3,000 federal immigration agents in his state. One image Ellison didn’t mention: the photo of a 5-year-old from Ecuador in federal custody, wearing a blue bunny hat and his Spider-Man backpack.
In Minnesota, the state has set up an online tip portal to capture citizen-generated evidence of federal misconduct or unlawful behavior, including cellphone images, after the U.S. Department of Justice refused to share evidence in Good’s death with county prosecutors and Ellison’s office. Similar evidence-gathering portals or federal accountability commissions are in place in Colorado, Illinois and Oregon.
When ordinary people capture aggressive federal tactics on video, Ellison said, they’re also helping make a case in federal court that the mass federal deployment of immigration agents to their states is unconstitutional and violates state sovereignty. Minnesota has sued to end ICE’s aggressive enforcement action in the state, officially known as Operation Metro Surge.

(Photo by Erika Bolstad/Stateline)
Such evidence could also be critical if the federal government continues to resist investigating or pursuing federal criminal charges against the unidentified agents who killed Pretti, as well as Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who killed Good. In a separate case, a federal judge issued an order after Pretti’s death blocking the Trump administration from destroying or altering evidence related to the shooting.
Constitutional limits make it difficult, although not impossible, for states to prosecute federal officers for violations of state law, said Bryna Godar, a staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School. But there are some successful cases in which states have pursued officers who are alleged to have gone beyond the scope of their federal duties or have acted unreasonably in carrying out those duties, she said.
Such cases arise most frequently during periods of considerable friction between states and the federal government, Godar said, including disputes over enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act, Prohibition, and integration and desegregation policies. Another such test of federalism and state sovereignty may be upon us, she said.
“It seems like we’re potentially entering another period or in another period of increased friction between the states and the federal government in a way that could lead to these cases again,” Godar said.
Ellison said that state and county investigators were proceeding carefully and deliberately with their own investigation.
“It’s true that the feds are denying us access to the investigative file,” Ellison said. “It’s also true that there’s no statute of limitations on murder.”
Noem has repeatedly insisted that ICE agents and other officers are the actual victims of the increased violence. She also has argued that protests and scrutiny of their enforcement tactics has not only interfered with their operations, but also has provoked the aggressive federal response.
Deputy U.S. Attorney Todd Blanche said Jan. 16 that the Justice Department will provide all resources necessary to support immigration enforcement, and will prosecute anyone they determine has attacked, impeded or obstructed federal efforts. The Justice Department issued subpoenas last week to multiple Minnesota Democratic officials in an investigation into whether those state leaders have impeded the enforcement surge.
In Minneapolis last week after meeting with immigration agents, Vice President JD Vance suggested the cellphone activism is causing the violence. He blamed “a few very far-left agitators” for the aggressive federal response, saying federal agents were “under an incredible amount of duress” and that state and local authorities had failed to cooperate. Following Good’s death, Vance described it as “a tragedy of her own making.”
“A lot of these guys are unable to do their jobs without being harassed, without being doxed, and sometimes without being assaulted,” Vance said, flanked by federal immigration officials working in Minnesota. “That’s totally unacceptable.”
Often, bystanders capture photos and video at great personal risk, as neighborhoods are swarmed by heavily armed federal agents in unmarked cars smashing car windows and dragging drivers to the ground, ramming doors at private residences and spraying protesters and observers in the face with chemical irritants. The bystanders’ videos frequently counter official, federal accounts of events.
The citizen-generated evidence aids in accountability and in making their case of federal overreach, said Ellison, who in 2021 led the successful prosecution of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the 2020 death of George Floyd. Chauvin’s conviction relied in part on 10 minutes of cellphone footage filmed by 17-year-old Darnella Frazier.
ICE is using Medicaid data to find out where immigrants live

Ellison and the other Democratic attorneys general encouraged people to continue bearing witness and posting to social media.
“Much of the evidence we’ve been able to generate is because of you,” Ellison said. “You have to fight in a courtroom. We absolutely have to. But ultimately, this country will be saved by the people of the United States. And so that means you’re protesting, you’re gathering evidence, you’re sharing with us … is actually how we’re going to win.”
Since their first lawsuit targeting Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order at the beginning of his term in 2025, the Democratic AGs have filed 77 cases. They’ve won 43 of the 53 resolved cases, according to a tracker from the Progressive State Leaders Committee.
It’s not that they want to file so many lawsuits, but they know they must, said Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who hosted Ellison, Rob Bonta of California, Anne Lopez of Hawaii and Aaron Frey of Maine. Oregon hadn’t even been to the U.S. Supreme Court to argue a case in a decade, Rayfield said, until the state took the lead last year on behalf of a coalition of a dozen states that sued over Trump’s sweeping tariff policy on most goods entering the United States.
“We’re not backing down,” Rayfield said. “We aren’t going to let this president continue to chip away our rights and our democracy at this time. We’re going to continue to fight for this entire term and do our job as attorneys general.”
Beyond the AGs, individuals, businesses, labor unions, professional associations, universities, local governments and other entities have filed 593 cases against the president’s expansion of executive branch powers since the beginning of his term, according to the daily digital law policy journal Just Security.
“The unlawfulness has only escalated,” Bonta said. “It’s gotten worse.”

She’s stopped visiting friends, she no longer goes to the gym or the park, and she’s gained 60 pounds since immigration enforcement ramped up in the past year.
Patricia moved to the U.S. from Mexico 18 years ago and built a life as an active member of her community in Connecticut. But today, the only time she leaves her house is to work for a few hours each weekend, cleaning offices.
“Any small noise startles me,” Patricia, who asked that her last name not be published for fear of immigration enforcement, said in Spanish. “I’m afraid to fall asleep deeply. Fear has taken over.”
Across Connecticut, residents who fear they or a loved one may be deported are self-isolating and facing mounting mental and physical health consequences as a result.
A survey from CT DataHaven released in October found nearly a third of Connecticut residents worry “a lot” or “some” that either they or someone close to them could be deported, detained or have their legal immigration status revoked. That concern is significantly higher among Latino residents, 44% of whom reported such fears.   

Anxiety surrounding potential immigration enforcement measures is leading some people to skip medical appointments, lose sleep and opt out of social activities — all of which, physicians say, damages mental and physical health. 
Missed appointments
Researchers at DataHaven found that, of the Connecticut residents who fear immigration enforcement, 14% have avoided medical care or know someone who has.
Camila Bortolleto is a steering committee member for HUSKY for Immigrants, a group that advocates to expand state-sponsored health coverage for residents regardless of immigration status. She said many immigrants are fearful that ICE will show up at their doctor’s appointment, or that they will get in trouble if they seek health care. 
“We’re seeing a lot of folks who are very scared to seek medical care,” Bortolleto said. “They ‘tough it out’ until it gets so bad that they need urgent medical care. At that point, it’s much, much worse, health-wise. It’s also much more expensive by that point.”
Research finds this is a general trend influenced by immigration enforcement increases or policy change. Atheendar Venkataramani, a clinician, researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, contributed to a study in 2021 that found that increased immigration enforcement correlated with a reduction in Hispanic individuals seeking health care. 
“On average, what we found was that there was less health care seeking, even among people with chronic conditions who we would expect to see their doctor relatively frequently,” Venkataramani said. “Ours is one study, but there are tons of studies that link immigration enforcement with health care seeking and health care outcomes.”
Immigration enforcement activity has escalated around the country since President Donald Trump took office. The administration and Department of Homeland Security tout ICE arrests, saying they are meant to “Make America Safe Again” by removing “criminal aliens.” The agency implemented high daily arrest quotas, and data shows large shares of those recently arrested by ICE across the nation have no criminal record. 
In Connecticut, arrests sharply increased following Trump’s inauguration. In August, a series of immigration raids across cities including Danbury, Stamford and Norwalk, dubbed “Operation Broken Trust,” resulted in 65 arrests. ICE agents staked out courthouses and police stations to conduct arrests of those entering the buildings. Earlier this month, a man was arrested by ICE inside the New Haven Superior Court building.
Organizations representing medical facilities in the state said there have been no reports of immigration enforcement officers entering Connecticut hospitals or community health centers. But, amid immigration-related unrest in Minnesota, there have been reports of ICE agents entering hospitals to accompany individuals that have been detained as they’re receiving medical care. 
On Monday, the American Medical Association released a statement stating that the presence of immigration enforcement activity in and around hospitals was “fueling fear among patients and hospital staff alike” and “ultimately undermines basic trust in our health care institutions.”
“To fulfill our oath and best serve our patients, physicians must be able to work in spaces that create a sense of safety for all, not fear for our most vulnerable,” AMA board chair David Aizuss stated.
Despite her fears around the spike in immigration enforcement, Patricia, who lives in central Connecticut, isn’t able to completely avoid medical care. She sees a doctor every three months to manage her diabetes. The disease runs in her family — she and seven of her eight siblings have it.
Zoom appointments are an option, but Patricia said she prefers in-person visits because they are more thorough, even though leaving the house makes her anxious.
“I go because of my health, but I go with fear,” Patricia said.

Laurel Shader worked as a pediatrician at Fair Haven Community Health Care for 32 years before retiring in April. Like Patricia, Shader said telemedicine can be marginally successful, but it doesn’t always have the same impact that in-person treatment can have, particularly for children. 
“I think the little kids can’t quite do it, in the same way that it was hard for little kids to do school online,” Shader said. “There are a lot of things that you have to have your hands on in order to do stuff. And you can only do that if you’re in person.”
Shader worries medical care avoidance could cause health outbreaks and that children with developmental issues may not receive the intervention they need. 
Mental health effects
Even beyond direct impacts to physical health, Shader said the major issue she saw among her patients and their families was behavioral changes.
“Some of the parents would talk about how concerned they were, and some of the older kids who were aware of what was going on would be afraid to be separated from their parents,” Shader said. “They thought that if they went to school, something might happen to their parents.” 
The DataHaven survey found that more than half of Connecticut residents who fear immigration enforcement report increased stress or anxiety. And of residents fearing enforcement, around 20% report avoiding public settings, like school and work, or reported problems eating and sleeping.
Venkataramani agreed with Shader, saying that mental health is likely the aspect of health that “shifts most exquisitely” with immigration policy and enforcement changes. He’s seen these changes first-hand in his own patients who are immigrants. 
“They’ll screen positive for depression and anxiety. They will come in with elevated heart rate, possibly elevated blood pressure,” Venkataramani said. “They’re very circumspect to share what’s going on.” 
Plus, increased stress can have dramatic physical effects on the body, impacting cortisol levels, metabolism and heart health, he added. One 2018 study found that immigration policy targeting undocumented residents in Arizona led to lower birth weight in babies born to immigrant mothers.
Patricia said she’s struggling mentally but can’t afford to get help. Without health insurance, she’d have to pay out of pocket to see a provider, and money has been tight  since her husband got severely injured at work two years ago. Patricia said she has to be her “own therapist.”
Based on her income alone, Patricia would qualify for traditional Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health coverage to people whose incomes fall below specified thresholds. But, outside of a few exceptions, undocumented immigrants and others without “qualifying immigration status” can’t access the program. 
Connecticut currently offers Medicaid-like coverage to children 15 and under — as well as women who are up to a year postpartum — who would qualify if not for their immigration status. Children who enroll are covered until they turn 19. The state does not currently offer any similar coverage for adults.
Patricia’s 16-year-old daughter, who is a citizen, receives health coverage through HUSKY. She’s the only one in the family receiving mental health treatment. Patricia worries her own stress impacted her daughter’s mental health.
“I think I caused part of my daughter’s anxiety,” Patricia said. “She often doesn’t want to leave the house. She stays home, and I think my warnings contributed to her fear.”
Patricia said there is a major need for mental health services within the immigrant community, particularly for those who are undocumented. She and her husband continue to live in fear with minimal support as they watch friends and families like their own get arrested by immigration authorities.
“Many people need mental health help,” Patricia said. “There are many families like us.”
Across the nation, many American-born or naturalized citizens have filmed encounters and arrests between immigrants and ICE agents, and many have protested immigration enforcement in Connecticut. Patricia recognized this support.
“Even though many Americans support us, if someone says ICE is at a location, Americans will go and film, and support people, the fear among immigrants is still huge,” Patricia said.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Earlier this month, the New Hampshire House passed what looks like a tiny change: a 0.05 percentage point cut to the Business Enterprise Tax. But this small number masks big consequences. 
Based on our research, the proposal would drain tens of millions of dollars from the state budget, could weaken funding for education, health care, and local services, and ultimately shift more costs onto families and property-tax payers, all while offering most businesses savings too small to meaningfully boost hiring or investment. Here’s what the data show, and why it matters for Granite Staters.  
First, this proposed change could drain millions from an already-strained state budget. Through examining past BET rate reductions, revenue trends, recent tax filing data, official state revenue projections, and interactions with the Business Profits Tax (BPT), we modeled the likely fiscal and economic effects of the proposed 0.05% change in the BET tax rate and found that if the proposed BET rate had been implemented during the current biennial state budget, it would have cost the state $26 million per year in BET revenue. 
For context, that is equivalent to more than half of last year’s budgets for the New Hampshire Veterans Home, the State Police, or the state’s road and bridge aid to towns and cities. This new annual revenue loss would be on top of the nearly $105 million in BET revenue the state is already set to lose in fiscal year 2026 due to prior reductions. These combined business tax cuts are almost twice what the state spent on targeted special education aid over the past two years. 
Second, business tax savings from the 0.05% reduction in the BET rate would be minimal and, in most cases, certainly not enough to spur hiring. The average business paying BET would save only about $47 per month from the rate reduction. When the 306 filers with more than about $18 million in taxable compensation or payments each are excluded from this calculation, the BET savings would average about $28 per month. The small savings companies will receive are clearly not enough to hire new employees, but they might be able to order a couple of pizzas. 
Third, while supporters of the tax reduction argue that reducing the BET could spur business activity and economic growth, thus ultimately increasing state revenues, the data simply do not support that claim. Historical data show no consistent statistical relationship between BET rates and job growth in New Hampshire over the last four decades. Prior studies, including New Hampshire’s own Commission to Study Business Taxes, have found no evidence that business tax cuts generate enough new economic activity to replace lost revenue, and NHFPI’s own analysis of business tax rate reductions in New Hampshire found that the business tax rate reductions cost the state about a billion dollars in revenue from 2016 to 2024.  
It is true that New Hampshire’s business tax revenues, when BPT and BET are included, have grown overall, but not consistently or as much as in many other states. From 2015 to 2024, our state’s business tax revenues more than doubled (a 118% increase). However, over the same period, business tax revenues more than tripled nationally (a 239% increase) and across the other five New England states (a 224% increase). If state business tax cuts had spurred revenue growth in New Hampshire, the state would have seen revenues outpace states that did not change their tax rates, rather than fall behind. 
Finally, cutting taxes for businesses gets expensive for Granite Staters. When business tax cuts reduce state revenue, the funding disappears, but the needs do not. Schools still need to operate, roads and bridges still need maintenance, and public health systems still need to provide care. With fewer state dollars available, communities are left struggling to meet the same obligations with fewer resources. Too often, the result is higher property taxes, which are already among the highest in the country. Those higher costs don’t stop with homeowners. They are passed on to renters and contribute to the state’s sky-high housing costs.  
The data are clear: this proposed BET cut would deliver minimal benefits to most businesses while creating real fiscal pressures for Granite Staters. As lawmakers look to the next state budget amid federal uncertainty and an ongoing affordability crisis, decisions about tax policy should be grounded in evidence and a clear-eyed understanding of who benefits and who truly pays.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/statehousedometrees-1024x640.jpg,,,2026-01-27 05:57:25.204578

Ohio’s 136th General Assembly is just past its halfway point, as the lawmakers operate on two-year cycles. Bills have until the end of 2026 to pass or else they die. 
Limiting Education Choice Expansions scholarships 
A bipartisan bill would limit Education Choice Expansion scholarships to families with a federal adjusted gross income of $500,000 or less.
Ohio state Reps. Justin Pizzulli, R-Scioto County, and Anita Somani, D-Dublin, introduced Ohio House Bill 643 earlier this month. 
The income threshold would be adjusted annually for inflation, according to the bill’s language. 
Lawmakers expanded the Education Choice Expansion eligibility to 450% of the poverty line through the 2023 state budget — creating near-universal school vouchers.
K-8 students can receive a $6,166 scholarship and high schoolers can receive a $8,408 scholarship in state funding under the expansion.
Ohio spent more than a billion dollars on private school vouchers for the 2025 fiscal year, the second full year with near-universal school vouchers. 
Nearly half of the money ($492.8 million) was from Education Choice Expansion vouchers. 
Make Election Day a state holiday 
An Ohio Senator is trying to make Election Day a state holiday. 
Ohio state Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, introduced Ohio Senate Bill 335, which would make the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November “Democracy Day.” 
Hawaii, Illinois, West Virginia, Maryland, and New York have Election Day as a public holiday and require employers to provide paid time off for voting, according to the Movement Advancement Project. 
Montana, Louisiana, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, and Rhode Island have Election Day as a public holiday, but do not require employees to provide paid time off for voting, according to MAP. 
Seventeen states require employers to provide paid time off for voting, but do not have Election Day as a public holiday, according to MAP. 
Ohio does not have Election Day as a public holiday nor does it require employers to provide paid time off for voting. Ohio does allow for voters to get a “reasonable amount of time” off during the day to do their civic duty.
Voter turnout in Ohio is higher during an election year. 71.71% of registered Ohio voters voted in the 2024 general election, 49.63% of registered voters voted in 2023, 52.32% in 2022, and 73.99% in 2020, according to the Ohio Secretary of State. 
Banning 17 year olds from getting married 
A bipartisan bill would repeal a law that allows a person who is seventeen to marry. 
Ohio Sens. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, and Bill Blessing, R-Colerain Township, introduced Ohio Senate Bill 341 earlier this month. 
This bill would require both parties getting married to be at least 18 years old. 
Ohio law currently has a provision that allows a 17-year-old to get married if they demonstrate to a judge that they received satisfactory marriage counseling, waited 14 days and the age difference is no more than four years.

Ohio cities are finally getting their long-awaited revenue from recreational marijuana after a year and a half of sales.
“It’s a decent chunk of change for sure,” City of Cleveland Spokesperson Tyler Sinclair said.
In November 2023, Ohio voters passed the legalization of recreational cannabis with 57% support.
The law gives the 10% tax revenue from each marijuana sale to four different venues: 36% to the social equity fund to help people disproportionately impacted by marijuana-related laws; 36% to host cities — ones that have dispensaries; 25% to the state’s mental health and addiction services department; and 3% to the state’s cannabis control department.
Due to a procedural issue, that money had been sitting in a state fund.
“We expected to receive some of the revenues last year, and that didn’t happen,” City of Akron Finance Director Steve Fricker said.
Although that funding structure was just changed by lawmakers, the state did release the money to the municipalities.
Sinclair explained that Cleveland just received about $740,000 of the $800,000 they earned through 2025.
“We’re appreciative and glad we can use that towards some basic city services, including some public safety,” Sinclair said.
“I know roads are top of mind right now, especially because of the weather,” he said, chuckling. “It’s really bad weather we’ve got, it’s being reported that we’re going to get a record Snowmageddon… It’s undetermined exactly the specifics of what the money is going to go towards.”
The marijuana dispensaries earned about $36 million total for their communities, the state reported.
While Cleveland was in the top ten performers, it paled in comparison to Columbus, which earned $4.7 million.
Cincinnati will bring in $2.5 million, and Columbia Township in Hamilton County is next with $1.5 million.
Dayton earned $1.2 million; Canton will get $1.1 million; Monroe City in central Ohio will have $950,000; Wintersville Village by Steubenville is getting $900,000.
Next, Akron is set to receive about $880,000.
“We’re happy to have the revenue,” Fricker said.
The amount was a bit lower than Akron expected, but he’s grateful to have it for the city’s needs.
“It’s going to go into our general fund that the city has, that primarily funds our police officers and firefighters,” he said.
He predicts they will only earn more.
“We have some dispensaries that are going through the approval process now,” Fricker said. “When those might open, [those] would impact what future revenue that we get.”
Sinclair isn’t sure why other cities did better, he said, but he guessed the number of dispensaries played a role.
Cleveland’s surrounding areas have dispensaries, whereas Akron has a stronghold on Summit County.
Columbus, which is triple the land mass of Cleveland and triple the population, also has triple the number of dispensaries.
Still, a handful of cities decided to ban marijuana sales. Some of them said they didn’t think the money would be enough.
“I would say anytime that we can get an influx of money, especially $750,000, that’s money that we don’t have currently, and that’s money that will go towards various needs in our community,” Sinclair said. “I do want to level set with some expectations. It’s not going be enough for us to build a brand new skyscraper in the middle of downtown Cleveland, right?”
The cities are expecting to get the rest of the money in the coming weeks.
Other cities and their plans
Cleveland Heights
“The City of Cleveland Heights is excited to receive $190,000 from the allocation. We have not yet determined possible uses for the funds. We plan to work with City Council to consider options that best serve our residents,” a spokesperson for the city said.
Columbus
“In 2024 Columbus City Council legislated that these funds, when received, will go into a Cannabis Host Community Special Reserve Fund, with future use requiring the approval of Council. Mayor Ginter would like to see these funds directed toward critical needs constrained in this year’s budget, so they strengthen core services for Columbus residents,” a spokesperson for the city said.

CLEVELAND, Ohio — Two asylum seekers previously arrested in Athens County will seek voluntary departure from the United States due to the toll that their ongoing detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcements has taken on them, their attorney told the Independent.
Victor Laverde Laguna and Gregory Javier Laverde Laguna are dual citizens of Colombia and Venezuela, and they arrived in the U.S. legally, seeking asylum. But after they were arrested in Athens County in September, the brothers were transferred into ICE custody the following month.
Gregory Javier Laverde Laguna has Down syndrome. Victor Laverde Laguna told the Independent in a Dec. 18 interview that Gregory Javier Laverde Laguna has faced dire conditions throughout the period of their detention.
The brothers remain in ICE custody despite the fact that the criminal charges against both brothers were dismissed in November. An Athens County judge stated that both brothers remain innocent in regard to those charges.


The brothers’ attorney, Liliana Vasquez, previously told the Independent that it was highly unusual that the brothers were taken into ICE custody during the course of their local criminal proceedings.

Vasquez suggested local law enforcement cooperation with ICE was likely responsible, although the Athens County Prosecutor’s Office previously denied cooperation with ICE and the Athens County Sheriff’s Office previously told the Independent the office does not communicate with ICE.
Vasquez previously said that, had the brothers not ended up in ICE custody prior to the conclusion of their criminal cases, they would likely not have been transferred to ICE in the first place. But after being taken into ICE custody, it is difficult to secure release.
An immigration court judge last month declined to consider a request from the brothers to grant them bond, due to directives by the Trump Administration.
Victor Laverde Laguna has not stopped fighting for his brother throughout their months-long detention, he told the Independent in a Dec. 18 interview.
After their request for bond was denied, Victor at first said he was determined to pursue other paths to freedom and to remain in the U.S. However, after that, “It just seems like everything kind of fell apart,” Vasquez told the Independent.
The brothers will seek departure to Colombia due to the ongoing upheaval in their home country of Venezuela, following the U.S. arrest of President Nicolas Máduro, Vasquez said.
Victor Laverde Laguna previously told the Independent he and his brother were seeking asylum in the U.S. due to fear of retaliation for his outspoken statements against Máduro’s government.
Julio Laverde Belandria, Victor’s son, previously told the Independent that a return to Venezuela would mean “certain death” for the brothers.
Vasquez told the Independent that the U.S. arrest of Máduro did not impact the brothers’ decision to request voluntary departure, rather than continuing to fight to stay in the U.S.
“Nothing else changed,” Vasquez said in regard to conditions in Venezuela following Máduro’s ouster. “It just seems to be a matter that they don’t want to be detained anymore, because of the toll that it’s taking.”
Amid the ongoing upheaval in the region, in which U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened military action against Colombia, Vasquez said she advised Victor, “I don’t know what issues we’re going to be running into in terms of, like, length of time that you’re going to have to be in jail.”
Regardless, that is the path Victor wants to take, Vasquez told the Independent, viewing it as the quickest way to end his and his brother’s detention.
The Independent requested an interview with Victor for this story via Vasquez but was unable to arrange a conversation by press time.
Victor Laverde Laguna and Gregory Javier Laverde Laguna were arrested by Athens County law enforcement in September 2025 as the Major Crimes Unit targeted an alleged extortion scheme.
The brothers have maintained that they responded to a Facebook ad for jobs as couriers, not knowing there was anything illegal about the operation.

(Photo by Andy Sacks/Getty Images)Five Sedgwick County Juvenile Intake and Assessment Center officers held a 135-pound, 17-year-old Cedric “C.J.” Lofton face down, pressure on his back, until he died in 2021.
Can anyone reasonably believe these five officers considered themselves at great risk of bodily harm, part of the “stand your ground” standard Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett used in declining to prosecute them?
As Lofton’s civil case returns to Sedgwick County District Court, “stand your ground” likely won’t occupy the plaintiff’s arguments, but for those who watched helplessly as the district attorney refused to charge officers citing this law, the wound has not healed.
Stand-your-ground laws feel like an extension of qualified immunity — which protects law enforcement from virtually all deadly force claims — to the gun-carrying public, expanding legal protections to people choosing deadly force and then claiming self-defense. They rose to prominence following the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin at the hands of George Zimmerman, who’d been ordered by a police dispatcher not to engage the teen.
Zimmerman ignored those commands, and overwhelmed by the youth, shot and killed him.
A jury freed Zimmerman on the state’s stand-your-ground law, essentially deciding that he had the right to create a deadly confrontation, shoot the youth he accosted and then claimed self-defense.
Since then, states across the county — including Kansas — have written similar laws into their books, arguing a right to escalate potentially dangerous situations and yet claim as aggressors they were at great risk of bodily harm. This “shoot first,” or “choose violence,” law benefits men who measure their virility by firearm gauge or caliber rather than by character.
According to a post by the ACLU of Kansas, these laws can even shield police from accountability in deadly force incidents against people in custody, as in the case of C.J. Lofton.
People and groups who have studied the law’s ill effects continue to lobby for repeal.
Journalist and author Radley Balko, a former Washington Post columnist, has said white defendants using deadly force against Black victims are more likely to have their actions deemed justified than Black defendants in similar situations. Balko also has said the laws encourage vigilantism and reveal a startling alignment between the “warrior cop” philosophy of aggressive policing.
Brady United Against Gun Violence, the organization that backed the landmark Brady Bill following the assassination attempt on President Ronald Regan, has offered more concerning statistics.
It argues that these laws increase homicides by up to 11%; that in any given month, approximately 30 to 50 people nationwide die because of them; and that deterrence, burglary, robbery and aggravated assault aren’t affected by stand-your-ground laws.
Brady United also observed racial disparities.
According to its website, the odds of a white person killing a Black person and it being ruled justified is 281% greater than a white person killing a white person. No matter the perpetrator’s race, they were twice as likely to be convicted if the case involved white victims.
It’s worth mentioning again that Donald Black’s “The Behavior of Law,” written in 1976, said the offender-victim combination typically drives such decisions. Black argued legal system behavior was “quantifiable, predictable, and follows deducible general rules.”
The most prosecuted cases? In descending order: Black-on-white crime, white-on-white crime, white-on-Black crime and Black-on-Black crime.
Lofton can be counted among the system’s valueless Black victims.
Detention officers Jason Stepien, Brenton Newby, Karen Conklin, William Buckner and Benito reportedly restrained Lofton for nearly 45 minutes, roughly 10 minutes longer than Bennett’s report noted. One employee restraining Lofton told police he’d applied weight to the teen’s back.
Where’s the threat of great bodily harm? A slight 17-year-old boy held on his stomach for 45 minutes? This doesn’t qualify even under the unjust law’s own standard.
Court of Appeals Judge Carolyn McHugh, writing for Judges Richard Frederico and Allison Eid of the 10th Circuit last year, put it this way: “Defendants had sufficient control over (Lofton). At that point, a reasonable officer would have perceived the threat had passed, and that the use of deadly force was no longer reasonable. Instead, five officers continued to subject Mr. Lofton to a prone restraint while his legs were restrained, and he appeared not to move for prolonged periods.”
Bennett used “stand your ground” in defense of the detention officers.
But this system, the community and this state, must stand up for Lofton while stamping out this heinous law.

Thank God we have video.


– Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. 


In less than three weeks of the new year armed federal agents in flak jackets and full-face masks shot and killed two American citizens. 
Smartphone cameras captured the state-sanctioned executions of a Minneapolis mom and an I.C.U. nurse on videos seen worldwide. 
The pitched screams of horror-struck bystanders is soul-crushing. 
You cannot unsee the savage shootings by amped-up Border Patrol and ICE commandos despite the obscene gaslighting spewed by a sick regime. Do not look away. 
First it was Renee Good, mother of three, gunned down in her Honda Pilot as she tried to drive away from cowboys in balaclavas spoiling for a fight. 
On Saturday, it was Alex Pretti, a federal employee at the VA Medical Center in Minneapolis, gunned down in the street after he tried to help a woman shoved to the ground by a turbocharged federal thug. 
Pretti was pepper-sprayed, pinned, and pummeled by half a dozen border control brawlers who fired at least ten rounds into him — after they disarmed the man of his lawful concealed carry firearm.
Just another extra-judicial killing of a U.S. citizen in service to a lawless president who immediately defended his paramilitary stormtroopers and shared an image of “the gunman’s gun” to vilify the dead man as a domestic terrorist who assaulted “ICE PATRIOTS” doing their job. 
Trump lackeys deployed the same lie to absolve ICE “patriot” Jonathan Ross after he shot Renee Good in the head earlier this month and muttered “f***ing bitch” as she bled out in her SUV.  
Nothing to see here except abundant video evidence of two Americans slain by federal agents in cold-blood.
Urgent course correction to save our unraveling republic cannot wait for the midterms. 
Trump’s rapidly expanding private army is seeding state terror across the country to cow the traumatized into silence and submission. 
We are all cooked if this nightmare is not swiftly neutralized with strict oversight by the vanishing bulwarks of liberty on both sides of the political divide. It is now or never. Do not let any politician who seeks your support change the subject or hide. 
Former Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich was clear-eyed about what went viral Saturday. 
Agents of the state killed a second American and for a second time the state fabricated a narrative to exonerate itself. 
“What’s happening in Minnesota is waking up the whole country,” he posted. “It’s bothering us because we don’t see justice and fairness. It’s tearing the country apart but it’s also raising the consciousness of Americans who say enough is enough.”  
U.S. Senate Democrats are there. They vowed to block a funding package this week if it includes money for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Border Control and ICE.  
“Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences” said Washington state U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, ranking member of the appropriations committee. 
Even some Senate Republicans may balk after DHS and the Justice Department demanded that Minnesota turn over the state’s voter rolls in exchange for federal help on the latest fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration agents. 
A quid pro quo for the rule of law if the government can surveil Minnesota voters??
Seven Democrats in the U.S House voted for the DHS spending bill, but Ohio’s 9th District congresswoman Marcy Kaptur was not one of them. 
“Funding of these agencies without reform and accountability is directly opposed to what our Founders promised,” she posted the day federal agents killed at 37-year-old intensive care nurse. “Kristi Noem [DHS head] must step down and all involved in this tragedy and implementation of the policy that allowed it should be investigated.” 
Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno reserved his outrage for remarks by a Lucas County Commissioner who likened ICE agents to terrorists. 
He fired off a letter to Pete Gerken expressing his “sincere disgust regarding the dangerous public comments you made about our brave men and women in uniform” but expressed no similar disgust with the shooting deaths of two Americans by state police creating content for Stephen Miller’s dystopian dream, nor the administration portraying both of its victims as “domestic terrorists” without evidence.
A week after Renee Good was shot dead by an ICE agent held blameless without investigation, Ohio’s U.S. Sen. Jon Husted praised ICE for keeping “people safe” and insisted that “by and large, they do a really good job at accomplishing that.” 
But the intentionally detached-from-reality Republican warned Ohioans to stay clear of ICE combatants fitted for Fallujah or “you get tragedies like we saw in Minneapolis.”
Former Ohio Democratic U.S Sen. Sherrod Brown, who is running against Husted for his old seat, decried ICE tactics the day before Alex Pretti died in a hail of bullets from federal gunslingers. 
ICE agents had positioned a Minnesota child as a decoy to capture his asylum-seeking father. 
“It’s unconscionable and immoral that ICE would use a five-year-old boy as bait,” Brown said. “What’s playing out has nothing to do with keeping communities safe by going after violent criminals and human traffickers. The targeting of innocent families and American citizens is unacceptable.” 
Dr. Amy Acton, Ohio’s former top public health official and Democratic governor candidate, said that what we are witnessing in Minnesota is not normal or OK.
“Law enforcement should be keeping people safe by going after dangerous criminals not terrorizing communities.”  
But they are and you are not immune. Do not look away.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Hours after Gov. Tim Walz said President Donald Trump was open to an independent state investigation into the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents this month, Minnesota state and local lawyers told a federal judge Monday that they had reason to believe federal agencies wouldn’t follow through.
The hearing revealed an extraordinary conflict between Minnesota and the federal government over whether local authorities should have access to key evidence, which would help them deliberate about potential charges against federal officers in the Good and Pretti cases. 
Citing “serious irregularities in procedure” by agents on the ground and senior government officials in Washington in the aftermath of Pretti’s killing on Saturday, Minnesota Deputy Solicitor General Peter Farrell asked Judge Eric Tostrud to extend an emergency order barring federal law enforcement agencies from destroying or altering evidence in the case.
Tostrud, who President Trump appointed to the federal bench during his first term, issued the order late Saturday night. 
On Monday, Tostrud said he was swayed by a sworn statement from BCA Superintendent Drew Evans that the BCA had reason to believe federal personnel had already mishandled critical evidence, including Pretti’s alleged handgun. Within hours of the incident, the Department of Homeland Security shared photos of the handgun and a loaded magazine that had apparently been removed from the scene of the shooting and placed on a car seat.
“(We have) very serious concerns that Pretti’s alleged firearm was not handled properly,” Farrell said.
Farrell and Clare Diegel, his counterpart at the Office of Hennepin County Attorney, also asked Tostrud in the lawsuit filed Saturday afternoon to declare the federal agencies’ stonewalling “unconstitutional and unlawful” and require them to share evidence with state and county investigators as needed. 
Tostrud did not issue a ruling from the bench Monday but indicated he would do so soon. State and county investigators are pursuing independent investigations of the Good and Pretti shootings, though legal experts say they face long odds due to limited access to evidence and prejudicial statements by top federal officials. 
Farrell, who represents the BCA in Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension et al v. Noem et al, said DHS’ decision to share photos of Pretti’s alleged handgun was one of several questionable choices DHS and other federal agencies made after the shooting. The state was also troubled, he said, that federal personnel twice blocked BCA investigators from the scene of the shooting — even after the investigators returned with a signed judicial warrant.
At Tostrud’s prompting, Farrell allowed that the federal government might — hypothetically — have reason to restrict state investigators’ access to evidence in cases with significant national security implications. 
But “we are miles away from that here,” he said.
Farrell later told Tostrud that Evans could not recall a situation “in his experience” where federal investigators restricted their state counterparts’ access to evidence. Evans joined the BCA in 2005, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Farrell said that sworn affidavits from employees of two federal agencies, the Border Patrol and Homeland Security Investigations, were of limited value because neither appeared to have been present at the scene of the incident. 
In another sworn declaration, an FBI agent present at the scene said — without providing specifics — that protest activity prevented federal investigators from following “normal procedure” after the shooting near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street in south Minneapolis. 
Farrell highlighted two other irregularities in the case that he said made the extension of Tostrud’s initial order “a no-brainer.”
First, that Homeland Security Investigations is the lead investigative agency in the case rather than the FBI is highly unusual and perhaps unprecedented, Farrell said. Second, senior government officials’ “rush to judgment” — with Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino and others proclaiming or amplifying others’ claims that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” intent on killing federal officers — leaves BCA skeptical that an impartial investigation is forthcoming, he said.
“BCA would never put (such) statements out into the world like that,” Farrell said.
Appearing alone and caveating that he was “local counsel” for the federal government rather than its lead attorney, Assistant U.S. Attorney Friedrich Siekert said Homeland Security Investigations and other agencies were following applicable law and would preserve evidence as long as required to support a multifaceted investigation that he suggested would continue for some time. He asked Tostrud to allow Saturday’s order to expire while the judge weighs the plaintiffs’ evidence-sharing request.
“I have not been told that what they are doing will cease,” Siekert said, referring to his clients’ ongoing examination of the evidence. But because “this whole event arose out of a federal immigration matter,” the state presently has no investigative role to play, he added.
“We don’t want the court to micromanage an ongoing federal matter at this point,” Siekert said.
Diegel disagreed, saying the local authorities “do have a sovereign interest” in investigating the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis resident. She said the unprecedented nature of Operation Metro Surge and Twin Cities residents’ pushback in the streets — not to mention senior officials’ statements suggesting they’d already come to a conclusion about what occurred — raised the possibility that federal investigators could quickly wrap up the investigation without informing their state counterparts. At that point, they may conclude that the evidence no longer merits preservation.
“Nothing about what is going on here is normal,” Diegel said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260124_0553-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-27 00:57:07.539826

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)Last week we witnessed the fast-tracking of House Bill 312 — to allow 18 to 20 year-olds to concealed-carry firearms — when it was first heard in the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning and breezed right through the full House 48 hours later with a vote of 73-17.
One lawmaker, Rep.  T.J. Roberts, a Republican from Boone County, argued in favor of the bill on the House floor, saying “Every 18 to 20 year old who wants to carry a concealed firearm probably already does in this commonwealth. I’ll take the Fifth on if I was ever one of those 18 to 20 year olds, but that’s a point that we have to consider.”
There is nothing quite like a lawmaker arguing that young people are already committing a crime, and that he might have committed such a crime himself, so now that he is in a position to make laws, let’s all vote to make it legal?
People are already committing other crimes. Should our legislators change the laws to give them a pass, too?
What a stunning, boneheaded argument. And there was no response from fellow lawmakers or the House speaker as they passed the bill and moved right along to the next item on the agenda.
Headspinning.
Last year a similar measure, Senate Bill 75, made it through the Senate but not the House. So let’s see this year if the Senate — the alleged grown-up side of the chamber — has the integrity and wherewithal ignore HB 312 outright.
And because we do not live in a bubble, I would be remiss to write about gun bills without acknowledging Second Amendment rights and the terror of what is happening on the ground in Minneapolis after yet another person was gunned down by federal agents, seemingly without any apparent justification.
Even Maria Bartiromo of Fox News seemed completely exasperated with the false narratives being propagated by the Trump administration with regard to this incident. On her Sunday show, she said to Kentucky Congressman James Comer, “Another individual is dead at the hands of Border Patrol. Let’s be clear, we do not know if there was any pushback from this individual who was armed. We do not have evidence that he was waving a gun [or] doing anything to threaten Border Patrol.”
Comer did not respond to Bartiromo’s statements, pivoting to how great it was when federal law enforcement came to Washington D.C. and blaming Minnesota officials for their language.
The victim, Alex Pretti, had a legal permit to carry, according to local law enforcement.  There is no current, public video evidence to show he even touched his firearm before Border Patrol removed it and then proceeded to shoot him to death.
“I’ve watched that video dozens of times in slow motion. I’ve tried to determine whether he actually pulled a gun out or not,” Comer said. “I don’t know. I just know that the situation’s bad there.”
Grotesque. Inhumane. UnAmerican.
As reported by fellow States Newsroom outlet, the Minnesota Reformer, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said there are now 3,000 federal officers to Minnesota, or nearly five times the number of sworn Minneapolis police officers. “How many times must local and national leaders plead with you, Donald Trump, to end this operation and recognize that this is not creating safety in our city?” Frey said.
Why is the Minneapolis story important to Kentucky?
Because House Bill 47 — note the shamelessly pandering nod to the 47th President Trump — already has 18 sponsors and was assigned last week to Judiciary, the same committee that started the fastball rolling for HB 312.
HB 47 reads as follows:
“Create a new section of KRS Chapter 16 to define “Task Force Model Program”; require Kentucky State Police posts to enter into agreements with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement to participate in the Task Force Model Program; require Kentucky State Police officers who participate in the Task Force Model Program to complete Immigration and Customs Enforcement training; amend KRS 15.404 to provide that any peace officer who completes Immigration and Customs Enforcement training will be deemed to have completed annual in-service training; require the Kentucky Law Enforcement Council to certify the Immigration Authority Delegation Program as an approved in-service training program.”
How can so many of our lawmakers — the people we elected to represent us — watch the absolute horror continuously unfolding in Minneapolis and say yes, with HB 47 we ask those same federal agents and their constant chaos, brazen cruelty and masked men shooting protestors for practicing their First and Second Amendment rights to come here.
No thank you.
Kentucky law enforcement does not need this headache.
Kentucky families don’t need it, either, anymore than they need to worry about 18 year old kids showing up at parties and sports fields and parks and bus stops with concealed, loaded guns in their backpacks.
Kentucky families need affordable housing, good public education, better access to healthcare that doesn’t bankrupt them, reliable transportation, and good paying jobs.
How about our lawmakers concentrate on that.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_1140-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 00:57:07.539826

Wes Moore's (D) $70.8 billion spending plan unveiled last week closes a more than $1.5 billion deficit for fiscal 2027 but does little to ease projected future budget pain, lawmakers were told Monday.","A Department of Legislative Services chart shows the worsening state budget deficits in coming years. (Chart courtesy Department of Legislative Services)Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) $70.8 billion spending plan unveiled last week closes a more than $1.5 billion deficit for fiscal 2027 but does little to ease projected future budget pain, lawmakers were told Monday.
In the first analysis of Moore’s budget, Department of Legislative Services budget analyst David Romans told members of the Senate Budget and Taxation and House Appropriations committees Monday afternoon that the proposal “makes some progress” but still leaves billions in structural gaps over the next four years.
“I think this budget is a lot less complex than last year, likely less controversial than last year, but it does accomplish the spending affordability committee goals that were set,” Romans said. “So, it does make some progress.”
The budget, the fourth of Moore’s current term, increases funding for education, housing, and police initiatives. It also closes a $1.5 billion gap without new taxes or fees. But the plan leaves multibillion-dollar shortfalls looming in out years.
“It improves the structural outlook, certainly for fiscal ’27 and ’28 as well,” Romans said. “However, it does not make substantial progress for fiscal ’28 and beyond. So, we still face very substantial and challenging shortfalls in the out years that will likely be left to the next term to try to resolve.”
In December, the Joint Spending Affordability Committee recommended limiting the structural deficit to $600 million. Moore’s proposed budget exceeded that request.
With another budget deficit in Maryland, Republicans see an opportunity

Even so, the outlook over the next four years is “pessimistic.”
In the next term, the General Assembly and governor will have to deal with a $2.3 billion shortfall. That gap widens again, this time to about $3 billion in fiscal 2029. By fiscal 2031, the gap is projected to be $4.1 billion.
In addition to the costs that will be imposed on future budgets by the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s sweeping, decade-long education reform plan, the growing deficit will be driven in coming years by rising employee salaries and benefits, teacher retirement, and human services spending.
Not included in that outlook are potential lawsuit settlements related to the Child Victims Act, a 2023 law that lifted the 20-year statute of limitations for public and private entities accused of sexual abuse, essentially allowing victims to file suit at any time. If all the current suits that have been filed against the state under the law were settled for the maximum amount, the state could face a bill of almost $10.7 billion.
“It’s probably not something you’re going to have to deal with this session, but the Child Victims Act remains out there,” Romans said.
There are roughly 12,000 claims filed against the state, each with a potential maximum liability of $890,000. The potential liability equals almost 40% of the fiscal 2027 general fund budget.
The budget increases state aid to local governments by $370.5 million, or 3.2% over the current year. Of that, $359 million is earmarked for public education.
But not all the news is good for local governments.
Local health grants are flat-funded at $115 million.
And Moore proposed making local governments pick up 50% of the increased retirement costs for K-12 education, community colleges and libraries, an estimated $39 million tab for local governments to pick up.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Funding for local governments will be cut by about $27.2 million, driven mostly by reductions in the disparity grant. That money is sent to counties with lower-than-average per capita income tax revenues.
Prince George’s County will see a reduction of nearly $18 million. Allegany County will take a $6.3 million hit.
That cut comes as Allegany County continues to rebuild after a historic flood last spring that hit the communities of Midland, Lonaconing and Westernport particularly hard. The Federal Emergency Management Agency denied the state’s request for more than $33 million in relief aid.

Across the country, people exercising their constitutional rights to speak, protest, and record public activity are increasingly met with confusion, intimidation, and force.
Observing what the government is up to and peacefully protesting are among the most fundamental rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. It protects people across the political spectrum and has powered movements that expanded Americans’ rights for generations.
These protections require officials at every level of government to respect the constitutional limits on their power. When people’s most basic rights are ignored, our government erodes public trust and sacrifices the civil liberties that form the foundation of our democracy. Understanding our rights and the limits of government officials is essential to protecting public safety.
Here are key rights every Connecticut resident should know, whether they are a U.S. citizen or not.  Although these rights are the law, policing and the prosecutorial system are biased, and everyone has their own risk calculus to weigh when stepping out of the house.  What the law is on paper is no substitute for a person’s own sense of safety.
Attending a protest

Your rights are strongest in what are known as “traditional public forums,” such as streets, sidewalks, and parks. You also likely have the right to speak out on other public property, like plazas in front of government buildings, as long as you are not blocking access to the government building or interfering with other purposes the property was designed for.
Private property owners can set rules for speech on their property. The government may not restrict your speech if it is taking place on your own property or with the consent of the property owner.
You don’t need a permit to march in the streets or on sidewalks, as long as marchers don’t obstruct car or pedestrian traffic. If you don’t have a permit, police officers can ask you to move to the side of a street or sidewalk to let others pass or for safety reasons.
Shutting down a protest through a dispersal order must be law enforcement’s last resort. Police may not break up a gathering unless there is a clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic, or other immediate threat to public safety.
If officers issue a dispersal order, they must provide a reasonable opportunity to comply, including sufficient time and a clear, unobstructed exit path.
Individuals must receive clear and detailed notice of a dispersal order, including how much time they have to disperse, the consequences of failing to disperse, and what clear exit route they can follow, before they may be arrested or charged with any crime.
The First Amendment does not protect “true threats” or incitement. Incitement requires intent, imminence, and likelihood: You must intend to provoke another person to break the law immediately, and your speech must be likely to do so.

Recording in public 

When you are lawfully present in any public space, you have the right to photograph anything in plain view, including federal buildings, the police, and federal officials.
On private property, the owner may set rules about photography or video.
Police officers may not confiscate or demand to view your photographs or video without a warrant, nor may they delete data under any circumstances. However, they may order people to cease activities that are truly interfering with legitimate law enforcement operations.
Police should not order you to stop taking pictures or videos, and they may not demand that you delete your photographs or video.

If you are stopped by police 

Stay calm. Make sure to keep your hands visible. Don’t argue, resist, or obstruct the police, even if you believe they are violating your rights. Point out that you are not disrupting anyone else’s activity and that the First Amendment protects your actions.
Ask if you are free to leave. If the officer says yes, calmly walk away.
If you are under arrest, you have a right to ask why. Otherwise, say you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediately.
Don’t say anything or sign anything without a lawyer.
You have the right to make a local phone call. If you are calling your lawyer, police are not allowed to listen.
You never have to consent to a search of yourself or your belongings. If you do explicitly consent, it can affect you later in court.
Police may “pat down” your clothing if they suspect you have a weapon and may search you after an arrest.

You can find a comprehensive guide to protesters’ rights on the National ACLU website.
Protests are meant to disrupt complacency. They are how people force urgent issues into public view, especially when every other avenue has failed. When protests are met with excessive force, mass surveillance, vague dispersal orders, and worse, deadly violence, it sends a clear message: stay home, stay quiet, or risk harm. That is not public safety. It is repression. And it corrodes the foundation of our democracy.
Our government has a responsibility to ensure that people can exercise their constitutional rights without fear of retaliation. Knowing your rights is the first step.

For college students in particular, developing an authentic identity in a politically polarized environment is like trying to stand on shaky ground. Focusing on spirituality instead of politics is an alternative way for young adults with various religious beliefs to form an identity amidst political anxieties. 
By definition, spirituality is “the quality of being concerned with the human spirit or soul as opposed to material or physical things.” However, in practice, spirituality means different things to different people. For example, I developed my spiritual understanding of what Judaism means to me through Hillel.



Hillel is a nationally recognized secular Jewish organization for college students that fosters a sense of belonging among Jews who are often a minority on campus. While living on a liberal arts campus that I and some of my peers describe as politically divisive, Hillel helps me feel safe, grounded, and most importantly, like I belong.
Spirituality is not just an outlet for Jewish students. Spiritual Muslim, Buddhist, Christian, and atheist students alike are finding belonging by focusing their attention internally, which is eternally rewarding. A multireligious spiritual study concludes: “…as a core construct of identity, spirituality was an essential part of personal growth and integration as well as a foundation for approaching life challenges…”
At Northeastern University, spiritual organizations reported an increase in involvement which often led students, such as Lutheran Episcopal Church attendee Munin Mundt, to a spiritual awakening. Mundt explains, “I felt very comforted and it felt very familiar while also being different in needed ways.”

It’s important to note the differences between spiritual and religious. Spiritual college students are not necessarily becoming more religious. Religion is defined as the belief in and worship of a superhuman power(s), especially a God(s). According to the Pew Research Center, in 2023 41% of Americans agreed that they became more spiritual, compared to only 24% of respondents who became more religious.
As religion is becoming increasingly politicized, such as Christianity being affiliated with the Republican Party, some formerly religious individuals are wary of being associated with a political party. In response, while some citizens entirely replace religion with spirituality, most avoid political affiliations by modifying their religious beliefs to become more spiritually oriented.
Spirituality is comforting because it is more individualized than religion, allowing the picking and choosing of beliefs, like a spiritual salad bar. Various religious beliefs can be added, dropped, or refined to better fit individual spiritual practices. This year, at an Office of Religious and Spiritual Life (ORSP) event, I learned how to meditate. Even though this is not a Jewish custom, I found value in meditation, and now incorporate it into my Jewish spiritual practice.
My experience is not isolated. In A National Study of College Students’ Search for Meaning and Purpose, four out of five college first-year students reported “having an interest in spirituality.” The study also revealed that 55% of spiritual individuals are frequently able to find meaning during difficult times and 58% feel at peace and centered, compared to only 11% and 18%, respectively, of lower scorers on spirituality. It is comforting to know that my experience is neither unique nor concerning.
Modern day politics are failing to provide the sense of stabilization and security that young adults need during their pivotal time frame for development and self discovery. Instead, I believe that spirituality can be a needed outlet.
My confidence in my personal identity continues to solidify as I weave spirituality into my religious Jewish practice. As political polarization continues to grow, it is easy, especially for young people, to feel small and powerless. By turning inward and focusing on what I can control, on spirituality, the world looks more manageable – even more welcoming.
I therefore reject feeling flustered by a daunting world that seems impossible to change. Instead, I am among the growing number of college students who find strength, comfort, and control by nurturing spirituality.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that an Anne Arundel County man should not get a new trial in the attempted murder of his pregnant girlfriend after prosecutors withheld some information from him in the case.
The unsigned decision by the court went against rulings by two lower federal courts that had granted Charles Brandon Martin a new trial in the 2008 shooting of his girlfriend, Jodi Torok. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only judge who dissented from the ruling, but there was no written explanation for her dissent.
The justices said federal courts are bound by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) to give deference to state court rulings, unless the state court had “blunder[ed] so badly that every fairminded jurist would disagree” with the decision. That was not the case for Martin, the high court ruled.
“Faithful application of those standards sometimes puts federal district courts and courts of appeals in the disagreeable position of having to deny relief in cases they would have analyzed differently if they had been in the shoes of the relevant state court,” the court wrote in the 16-page decision. “But federal courts are dutybound to com ply with AEDPA, and we have granted summary relief when the lower courts have departed from the role AEDPA assigns.”
According to court documents, Martin was married and had two children as well as two other girlfriends in 2008 when he was told by Torok, his third girlfriend,  that she was pregnant. Martin wanted Torok to get an abortion. Not only did she refuse, but “intended to go to court to compel him to provide child support. She also threatened to tell his ‘wife or baby mama’ about the child.”
A few weeks later, in October, Martin sent Torok a text message asking when she would be at work, and Torok replied that she was off that day. Hours later, Torok’s housemate found her in their Crofton apartment, bleeding from an apparent gunshot wound to the head. Torok survived the shooting with permanent injuries, but the unborn baby did not.
Police recovered a spent .380-caliber shell casing from the apartment, along with a Gatorade bottle with the mouth end wrapped heavily in tape and a small hole in the bottom — what prosecutors argued was a homemade silencer for a gun.
DNA evidence presented at trial linked a hair that was found in the tape on the Gatorade bottle to Martin. Also at trial, Maggie McFadden, one of Martin’s other girlfriends, testified she saw Martin with a  “small semiautomatic gun in the weeks before the shooting.” McFadden’s brother said the same thing.
The state presented testimony from the third girlfriend, Sheri Carter, who said Martin kept a laptop computer at her apartment where she said he looked up silencers. Carter said Martin “got rid of it … because he didn’t want it found there” after Torok’s shooting.
The trial judge instructed the jury that Martin could be found guilty if he had aided or encouraged the attempted murder and assault with the intent that the crime succeed. Martin was found guilty as an accessory before the fact and sentenced to life in prison.
On appeal, Martin’s attorneys claimed that not only was the laptop not lost, it had been in police custody the entire time. They said a forensic computer report showed that no search for silencers had been done on the computer, which had not been used since 2005, discrediting Carter’s testimony.
In their 43-page petition to the Supreme Court, Martin’s attorneys wrote prosecutors failed to disclose “favorable” evidence to the defense to safeguard the defendant’s “right to a fair trial.”
“Had the report been disclosed, it would have destroyed the prosecution’s made-for-TV-movie theory,” wrote Martin’s attorneys. “The report would have discredited Carter’s testimony and thus eliminated the only evidence connecting Mr. Martin to silencers.”
Martin’s attorneys did not respond to requests for comment Monday evening. The Maryland Attorney General’s Office declined to comment on the case.
The Maryland Court of Special Appeals and the Court of Appeals rejected that argument and let Martin’s conviction stand. But a U.S. District Court judge in Maryland ordered a new trial for Martin over the state’s failure to disclose the computer report, and a divided panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling in January 2025.
But the Supreme Court ruled the AEDPA limits federal review of habeas claims raised by state prisoners. The justices wrote the act is an important but limited safeguard to protect against extreme malfunctions in the state courts’ adjudication of constitutional claims. It is not an opportunity for federal judges to decide “whether the state court’s opinion satisfies the federal court’s opinion-writing standards,” the justices said.
In addition, the justices wrote that evidence of Martin’s DNA on the Gatorade bottle, his text to Torok the same day as the shooting and testimony that he “owned the kind of gun that seemed to have used to shoot Torok” linked Martin to the crime.
Even if the undisclosed forensic report about the laptop had been disclosed at trial, the justices wrote, Martin “would have been convicted even if it the report severely impeached Carter.”
“Based on its review of the entire record, the court found that the evidence linking Martin to the crime was so strong that there was no reasonable probability that the result of his trial would have been different,” the justices wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/supremecourt-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-27 08:57:26.129942

In closing arguments, attorneys from both the Missouri Attorney General’s Office and Planned Parenthood brought the focus back to the crux of the case: are Missouri’s abortion regulations necessary safeguards for women or discriminatory road blocks for patients?
In a final attempt to cast doubt on the validity of the case, Peter Donohue, deputy solicitor general for Missouri, argued that Planned Parenthood had not met Missouri’s high legal burden needed to nullify state laws in total. 
Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang gave both parties until April 10 to file post-trial briefs. She urged them to opine on the burden-of-proof argument, which was recently addressed by the Missouri Supreme Court in a separate constitutional case on the state’s gender-affirming care ban for minors. 
The outcome of this month’s trial will determine the accessibility of abortion across the state before Missourians are asked to vote on whether they want to again ban the procedure in November.
Donohue defended the regulations as protecting women from unsafe abortion providers, which he accused of having a history “fraught with harms to women.” 
Even if current Planned Parenthood clinics provided safe care, as they testified, he said the state must think about any provider who might provide abortion care in the future. 
Abortion rights returned to Missouri one year ago. Access never did

“If they’re safe,” he argued, “these requirements don’t burden them.” 
But attorneys for Planned Parenthood spent days of testimony laying out how each regulation left clinics hamstrung to provide abortions. These regulations, introduced over the past few decades, increasingly drove Missourians out of state to get abortions. 
Planned Parenthood providers and staff recounted the toll the regulations took on patients left unable to access abortion quickly and close to home. 
These few dozen targeted regulation of abortion, or TRAP, laws are currently in state statute. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri filed a lawsuit asking a judge to deem the laws unconstitutional after voters approved the abortion rights amendment in November 2024. Some were temporarily enjoined last year, allowing procedural abortions to resume. 
“All these laws target abortion in a unique way,” Vanessa Pai-Thompson, an attorney with Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in her closing argument. “And a unique way that is now also an unconstitutional way.”
These regulations include required distribution of Missouri’s informed consent booklet prior to an abortion; a 72-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and an abortion; abortion facility licensing requirements; a ban on prescribing medication abortion via telehealth, and mandatory pelvic exams prior to a medication abortion.
Pai-Thompson said although abortion is essential health care, it remains regulated by state laws that are now discriminatory under the new amendment. Pai-Thompson then pointed back to a timeline showing decades of Missouri’s restrictions that have limited access.
Binders full of exhibits are wheeled into the hallway of the Jackson County courthouse on Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, at the conclusion of a 10-day-long trial over Missouri’s abortion rights amendment (Kevin Hardy/Stateline).
Two decades ago, several thousands abortions were performed in Missouri annually, according to state health department data. By 2021, the year before abortion was outlawed in Missouri, there were only 151, as a result of the TRAP laws. But many women still have abortions. In 2024, nearly 12,000 women went to Kansas and Illinois to end their pregnancies.
The state was the only side to call women to testify about their abortions, most of whom said they went on to regret them. This included a woman on Monday who said she obtained two medication abortions from the Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia in 2012 and 2015, the second of which was followed by an emergency surgery to remove fetal tissue. The exact details of her medical issue were not detailed during her brief testimony. 
Pai-Thompson in closings characterized the state’s expert witnesses — which included a parade of doctors who oppose abortion — as unreliable advocates. She underscored the medical consensus among leading medical organizations that abortion is safe, telling the judge that abortions pose less risk than pregnancy or childbirth. 
Testimony from Planned Parenthood earlier in the trial detailed that roughly 1% of the more than 53,000 Missourians who received abortions over the last 10 years in Illinois and Kansas experienced complications, ranging from infection to incomplete abortions to hemorrhaging. 
Planned Parenthood began the trial with Dr. Margaret Baum, chief medical officer with Planned Parenthood Great Rivers. She returned to the stand Monday to dispute the state’s characterization of women seeking abortions as being uncertain about their decision and easily coerced into abortion. 
“I find that infantilizing of my patients and of women in general,” Baum said. “Most of my patients who present for abortions already have been pregnant or already have children. They know exactly what it means to be pregnant.”
Baum also disagreed with assertions from state witnesses that women often regret their abortions. She said her patients most frequently express relief. And when she tells people about her work in social settings, she hears abortion stories from other women, who express gratitude. 
“The most common thing people have said to me is ‘thank you,’” Baum said. “‘My abortion saved my life.’”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0818-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 22:57:30.458215

This latest venture will be told through the eyes of children.

Called “Little Hearts — Big Roots,” the binational initiative centers on students at Pine Elementary in Omaha’s Little Italy neighborhood and partner schools in Carlentini, one of Omaha’s official sister cities.
The local students were invited to create artwork related to a “My World, Your World” theme that reflects their everyday Nebraska lives with family, food, traditions, neighborhoods and other cultural identity. 
Winning entries will be used as the foundation for mural workshops in Carlentini, where Sicilian children and artists will come up with their own creations. The results will be installed as murals stretching through the halls of Carlentini schools: Pirandello Elementary and Carlos V Elementary.
De la Guardia says the effort stands out for its kid-centric, ancestry-driven flair.
“It helps them connect with their roots,” she said. “They get to share a part of their world — which will be shown in another part of the world.”
 Mixture of cultures

Monday, about 25 students from Pine Elementary presented their art pieces to de la Guardia, who will leave later this week for Carlentini to work on the venture from that end. Monday’s batch joins another 20 or so already submitted. Entries will be accepted through Feb. 10.

Many of the youths share Italian roots, but have never visited the country of their ancestors. Others may be of another heritage, but are growing up with influences of the Little Italy area.
One third-grader painted a Dia de Los Muertos image, representing the Day of the Dead celebrated especially in Mexico, and said it reminded her of her grandma.
The student’s description brought de la Guardia to tears.
“That’s her culture. I wanted them to share their world,” de la Guardia said. “We come from many different cultures, and descend from immigrants all over the world,” she said, noting that Omaha’s Little Italy neighborhood has evolved into a mixture of cultures and backgrounds. 
The names of Omaha students will appear in the final murals alongside their art — adding another lasting memento of the sister city partnership that became official in 2024, following a “friendship” pact.
 Longtime bond 

A park named Omaha, on Italian island of Sicily, signals revived partnership

To be sure, the bond began more than a century ago, when an emigration wave sent nearly half the population of Carlentini — about 3,500 people — across the Atlantic Ocean to America to work, with the biggest share settling in Omaha.
Omaha’s Little Italy neighborhood has existed since those early days, but the sister city connection ramped up in recent years, fueled by younger generations’ thirst to better know their motherland. 
De la Guardia, whose Omaha mom was born in Carlentini and who retains close ties there, has encouraged ongoing ties, with projects including a podcast and the mural she helped paint and organize on a wall of Little Italy icon Orsi’s Bakery and Pizzeria.
She said the latest children-focused mural project is designed as the first phase of a multi-year effort called “United in Our Roots: A Tale of Two Cities.”
That larger venture aims for six install sites across Carlentini, featuring murals, mosaics and public art created via a cultural exchange to be led by de la Guardia and a team of about eight American and Sicilian professional artists.

Underlying the project is years of community-based work in Omaha’s Little Italy and a desire to preserve and activate cultural identity through art while creating tangible connections for local families, said de la Guardia.
 Another goal: ‘creative district’ 

She said the project also will help build the case for establishing a “creative district” in Little Italy, a designation by the Nebraska Arts Council.
Such districts have been named across the state and, for example, in Omaha’s Benson and historic Dundee neighborhoods. Key benefits include access to dedicated development grants, official state branding and could trigger increased economic activity through perhaps art galleries and events.
Once the youth art submissions are selected, workshops are to be held in Carlentini. De la Guardia also is seeking sponsorships to help with materials, workshops and costs of mural installation in Carlentini. She said the budget for that first-phase mural project is $15,000. 
Remaining phases call for another $400,000, for which de la Guardia said she is seeking grants and a grant administrator.
De la Guardia says she’s motivated by pride and love for her heritage  and wants others to enjoy connections to their ancestral roots as well.
“Everything I’m doing is from my soul,” she said. “And these kids put their hearts into their artwork. It really filled my heart.”

House Bill 1078 aimed to extend a concept already applied to approved computer science courses to agriculture programming. High school students can earn one of their required science credits with a yearlong computer course.
The bill came from Rep. Kaley Nolz, R-Mitchell. It cleared the House Education Committee 11-3 last week, but some of its committee supporters switched sides on the House floor when the bill first appeared there on Friday and failed, before Tuesday’s reconsideration attempt.
Bills that could change high school PE and science requirements advance in Legislature

Rep. Nicole Uhre-Balk, D-Rapid City, said she learned that it’s possible for agriculture teachers to get a waiver that would get their students science credit under current Department of Education rules.
“It’s not as onerous a process” as she was led to believe in the committee hearing, Uhre-Balk said.
Nolz argued that some teachers are too overburdened to deal with waiver requirements or may, in some counties, be intimidated by state bureaucracy.
“Why are they having to jump through hoops to prove it’s a science credit?” Nolz asked during debate on Friday. “Why not have it in books for clarity, certainty and, really, less administrative paperwork?”
The bill garnered a 33-31 vote on Friday, but needed a majority of the House’s 70 members to pass. Half a dozen lawmakers were missing that afternoon, and Aberdeen Republican Rep. Logan Manhart signaled an intent to reconsider the vote.
On Monday, the House said no to Manhart, voting 33-34 on a motion to reopen the debate.
Credit for sports falls
House Bill 1008 sought to extend physical education credits to high school athletes. 
Unlike with ag science courses, Rep. Kathy Rice said, South Dakota doesn’t have a way for coaches to translate their athletes’ work into high school credit. 
When students devote hundreds of hours to their athletics, the Blackhawk Republican said, their academics suffer. 
“That’s what it takes to do varsity sports,” she said.
Track coach and state Rep. John Shubeck, R-Beresford, said some of his athletes “work harder than their parents do” and don’t need a semester of physical education to learn how to stay fit and healthy into adulthood.
“When I see my athletes and the work they put in, they need a break,” Shubeck said.
Opponents, like Doland Republican Lana Greenfield, worried about unintended consequences of removing PE credits from classrooms.
“PE is a graded course. It is a part of your GPA. If you don’t have a certified coach,” Doland said, referencing the common rural phenomenon of non-teacher coaches across South Dakota, “who’s going to give the grade?”
Rep. Will Mortenson, R-Fort Pierre, mentioned that esports are now an officially sanctioned extracurricular sport in South Dakota.
“Are we going to give high school credit for playing video games?” Mortenson said.
The House vote on the measure was 31-36.

(Doyon Drilling photo/Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation)A winter oil-drilling campaign planned by ConocoPhillips will proceed without interruption despite the dramatic wreck of an oil rig over the weekend.
Doyon 26, claimed to be the largest mobile oil drilling rig in the United States, toppled over while being transported along a gravel road on the North Slope on Friday afternoon. A video of the crash shows a small fire erupting as the structure tumbles onto the nearby tundra.
Eight people were treated for minor injuries, according to a Sunday report from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, and up to 4,000 gallons of diesel fuel may have spilled.
The environmental effects of that spill, if any, are still being determined by that agency.
The rig, nicknamed “the Beast,” is owned by Doyon Drilling Inc. and was one of two that ConocoPhillips intended to use in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, located west of Prudhoe Bay, this winter.
ConocoPhillips is developing the vast Willow project in the reserve and intended to use both Doyon 26 and another rig as part of its winter development work, said Brandi Sellepack, manager of the company’s exploration program, in a court affidavit published Monday morning. Most new construction on the North Slope occurs during winter, when the ground is frozen and can be traversed with less harm to the environment.
The oil company’s drilling program has been legally challenged in court by several environmental and local groups, and its attorneys included details of the incident in a notice to the judge hearing that challenge.
“After assessing the impact of the unfortunate loss of Doyon 26, ConocoPhillips’s current plan is to proceed with the full four-well exploration drilling program utilizing a substitute drilling rig, Doyon 142, which is capable of completing all of the planned drilling scope that Doyon 26 was scheduled to complete,” Sellepack said in the affidavit. “As the drilling program proceeds, ConocoPhillips will evaluate whether aspects of the program must be shortened based on this change of plans, such as, for example, the extent of datagathering from the wells and the length of any production testing. This change of plans will not increase the scope of any aspects of the drilling program.”
The company said an underground seismic surveying program — intended to reveal the scope of oil pockets in the area — was unaffected by the rig’s accident and will proceed on schedule.
Development of Willow is seen as critical for the state treasury, according to current forecasts. Oil produced from the project will result in billions of dollars in tax revenue for the state treasury, local governments, and the U.S. government. 
At the same time, the project will have some effect on the local and global environment, both through construction and emissions that contribute to climate change.
Those side effects have been the topic of extended lawsuits, including one currently active in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska.
In its notice to the court, ConocoPhillips said it believes Friday’s accident is unrelated to the arguments raised in that case.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota voters should determine whether legislators need tighter term limits, the state Senate decided Monday at the Capitol.
If the House agrees, the measure will be on the November general election ballot.
The Senate voted 20-14 in favor of sending the proposed state constitutional amendment to voters. It would cap state lawmakers at 16 consecutive years of service, which equates to eight consecutive two-year terms. That would be added to the current term limits of eight consecutive years in either chamber. Currently, without an overall limit, legislators can bounce back and forth between the chambers repeatedly.
Sen. Michael Rohl, R-Aberdeen, sponsors the bill. He said 16 consecutive years is a reasonable maximum that still allows for the retention of experience while ensuring turnover and opportunities for “leaders of tomorrow.”
Opponents, including Sen. Carl Perry, R-Aberdeen, called it a “solution looking for a problem.” They argued the system already turns over frequently, and warned that forced turnover could weaken institutional knowledge and shift influence to bureaucrats and lobbyists. Perry said term limits reduce voter choice because elections already allow constituents to remove lawmakers every two years.

Larry Rhoden on Monday asked the South Dakota Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on whether the lieutenant governor, while presiding as president of the state Senate, may cast a tiebreaking vote.
“This is a matter of great public importance, and of significant impact on state government. Judicial interpretation would bring clarity and certainty to this matter going forward,” Rhoden wrote. 
Rhoden’s request follows a dispute last week after the Senate deadlocked 17-17 on passage of a bill updating permitting provisions for energy and transmission facilities. Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, presiding as president of the Senate, broke the tie with a “yes” vote, but Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, challenged the action. The Senate voted to uphold the challenge, voiding the tiebreaker. 
The potential for a tie exists because Sen. Arch Beal, R-Sioux Falls, is on an extended absence due to illness. The absence leaves an even number of senators, at 34, when the chamber typically has 35.
After the earlier tiebreaker was deemed invalid, the Senate reconsidered the affected bill on Monday, adopted an amendment, and passed the legislation. But while the bill’s fate was decided, uncertainty remains about future tie votes.
“If a tiebreaking vote cannot be cast for final passage, it will be impossible for any such piece of legislation to pass the Legislature and be presented to the governor for signature or veto,” Rhoden wrote. “An advisory opinion from the court is the only realistic way to resolve this question.”

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Opponents far outnumbered supporters Monday of two legislative proposals seeking to throw out parts of a 20-year-old Nebraska law allowing certain undocumented immigrants who grew up and graduated in the state to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities.
In all, 13 Nebraskans testified against Legislative Bills 1061 and 870, introduced by State Sens. Dave Murman of Glenvil and Bob Andersen of western Sarpy County, respectively. The bills were aired Monday during a two-hour public hearing before the Legislature’s Education Committee.

In contrast, one person showed up to speak in favor.
A combined 215 people wrote to the committee to object to the two bills, and 32 submitted written support.
The committee took no immediate action on whether to advance either measure to the full Legislature.
As state law currently stands, students who graduate from Nebraska high schools after living here three years and who meet certain other criteria — regardless of immigration status — can continue their education in the state by paying the same tuition rates as local counterparts who are U.S. citizens.
 ‘Attack’ on immigrants 

In response to questions from committee members, neither Andersen nor Murman could say how many students might be affected. They said their concern was fairness to taxpayers, though they identified no specific cost savings.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, a member of the committee, said the bills appear to be a tactic that perpetuates fear among immigrants. The proposed changes come as national and local protests have swelled over the Trump administration’s efforts to rid the country of undocumented immigrants.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Saturday in Minneapolis, the second U.S. citizen in three weeks was shot to death by federal agents while rallying against immigration enforcement in that city, which has escalated under the second Trump administration.
“I think that we have to put a name on the fact that this is really just another attack, I think, on immigrant neighbors in Nebraska and has very little, if anything, to do with budgetary savings,” said Conrad.
Andersen described his effort as “a simple bill to reimplement common sense and fiscal responsibility.”
“It’s a cost-saving effort and making sure people entitled to get the entitlement actually get it,” he said. Murman told the committee that he plans to withdraw his bill and support Andersen’s LB 870. 
The University of Nebraska doesn’t ask for documentation of a student’s immigration status and uses high school transcripts to verify whether the applicant is a Nebraska resident for tuition purposes, according to a legislative fiscal analysis for the Andersen bill. If the proposed changes pass, the analysis says, new verification procedures would need to be implemented at an estimated cost next fiscal year of about $372,400, and $383,572 the following year.
 ‘Magnet’ for illegal immigration

Doug Kagan, who leads Nebraska Taxpayers for Freedom, was the lone testifier in support of the bills. He said current in-state tuition provisions are a “magnet for further illegal immigration into Nebraska” and are “unfair” to American citizens.
Those testifying in support of the current law included university professors, immigration lawyers, a Douglas County commissioner speaking on his own and a veteran who described LBs 1061 and 870 as contrary to state efforts to strengthen the talent and workforce pipeline.

Crystal Garcia, a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said she wanted to appeal to lawmakers’ humanity.
“The proposed bills do not in any way improve the lives of Nebraskans,” she said. “(They) will also hurt Nebraska colleges and universities, as they will certainly lose students who will pursue education outside of Nebraska and critical revenue along with those students.”
When questioned by committee members — some of whom challenged the loose use of immigration terminology by the two bill sponsors — Murman and Andersen clarified that their goal is to repeal in-state tuition for students who do not have a lawful status in the country.
Murman said he wanted to comply with federal law and save Nebraska the cost of defending a lawsuit. 
Both proposals follow a push by the Trump administration to eliminate similar in-state tuition laws in other states. Under his leadership, the feds launched legal challenges in at least seven states with similar laws, including Texas, California, Illinois and Minnesota.

The U.S. Justice Department has argued that in-state tuition laws give an unfair benefit to foreign-born students unavailable to U.S. citizens and legal residents living in different states.
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward asked if Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers had weighed in on the legality of the proposals, to which Murman said no.
 ‘Brain drain’ pain

Among those opposing the bills was Lina Traslaviña Stover, a sociologist whose research has focused on access to higher education and who is executive director of a statewide immigrant advocacy organization called Heartland Workers Center.
She called the legislation “shortsighted” and opposite the goal of reversing Nebraska’s brain drain, the exodus of young talent from the state.
“These bills send a harmful message to middle school students from immigrant families that they are not welcomed or valued in our education system,” Stover said. “When students believe college is unattainable because of cost, they are more likely to disengage from school and leave the college-pre track. This limits their options for years to come.”

She estimated that a “small number” of Nebraska immigrants tap into the current in-state tuition provisions.
Douglas County commissioner Roger Garcia told the committee his wife, Yanira, was assisted by in-state tuition rates that have been in effect since the Legislature in 2006 overrode a veto by then-Gov. Dave Heineman. 
Yanira is now a U.S. citizen, a professional in the banking industry and an elected member of the Regional Metropolitan Transit Board. 
Undocumented students typically are not eligible for federal student aid. But in-state tuition can be the key pathway for higher education to some undocumented students already being educated in Nebraska’s public school system, Garcia said. 
“This is not a scholarship. This is not a financial grant. There is no money going into a student account. They are paying tuition,” he said. Garcia said he doubted the number of recipients in Nebraska is remarkable but said they likely work multiple jobs to pay for tuition. 
“So these are actually pretty outstanding students and young individuals in our state,” he said.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Lawmakers rejected a pretrial monitoring program Monday that was requested by South Dakota’s top judicial official, as some legislators expressed concerns about the perceived political persuasion of the foundation that pledged to pay for it.
House Bill 1015 came to the House of Representatives at the request of Steven Jensen, chief justice of the South Dakota Supreme Court. It would authorize a pilot program in Pennington County in which court service officers would watch people released on bond as they await trial to make sure they adhere to their release conditions and don’t miss court dates.
The state Unified Judicial System secured a $385,000 grant to pay for the yearlong experiment from the MacArthur Foundation, a Chicago-based nonprofit that focuses on criminal justice reform.

The foundation has extended grant funding to both Pennington and Minnehaha Counties in the past for programs aimed at reducing their jail populations and addressing racial and ethnic disparities in the justice system.
The House Judiciary Committee voted 10-3 last week to back the pilot program, but the bill authorizing it was met with a buzzsaw of opposition on the House floor. 
Nine of the 15 lawmakers who rose to speak on the idea urged a no vote, and six of the nine opponents lobbed criticism at the MacArthur Foundation for promoting policies they said make communities less safe and cost taxpayers money when grant dollars run out.
The House vote on the bill was 33-34.
Opponent calls grant money ‘woke’
“House Bill 1015 hands over control of our state policies to an unelected, unaccountable national foundation,” said Republican Rep. Mary Fitzgerald of St. Onge. “This organization answers to no one here, yet they want us to follow their agenda.”
Fitzgerald said the pilot program would heap extra burdens upon overworked court service officers in Pennington County, as the grant dollars don’t pay for additional staff. She argued that the pilot would lead to a “catch and release” justice system and turn South Dakota into San Francisco. 
“This bill may not say cashless bail, but it moves us squarely in that direction” she said. “The pilot program is funded by a group trying to eliminate cash bail across the country.”
Pretrial monitoring could reduce missed court appearances and improve outcomes, court officials say

The words “diversity, equity and inclusion” on the MacArthur Foundation’s website — listed as a core value on its “about” page — caught the eye of Aberdeen Republican Brandei Schaefbauer. 
“What are the strings attached” to work with the foundation, she asked lawmakers? She suggested that the foundation would push South Dakota to adopt permanent, further-reaching reforms that would cost taxpayers to maintain long-term.
“I do not think we will actually achieve our goals in reducing the recidivism,” she said, referencing a term for repeat offenses. “What we will achieve is bringing Marxist-communist propaganda to our state.”
Rep. Trish Ladner, R-Hot Springs, said she can’t trust that the pilot program would improve outcomes. Ladner noted that Pennington County had to expand its jail, even after accepting MacArthur Foundation money to implement alternatives to incarceration.
“The burden of the cost of the county government will ultimately result in an increase in the county’s property tax burden to its citizens,” Ladner said.
Republican Rep. Julie Auch of Yankton called MacArthur money “woke,” citing what she described as MacArthur’s “obsessive” focus on racial and ethnic disparities. 
“It’s unfortunate that a foundation of their stature is clearly engaging in politics,” Auch said.
Backers ask for deference to chief justice
Auch said she has “great respect” for Chief Justice Jensen, but that she sees the pilot program as potentially deleterious to public safety.
Rep. John Hughes, R-Sioux Falls, also referenced Jensen in his remarks, but did so to encourage colleagues to extend the chief justice respect and give a chance for the program he’d endorsed in his State of the Judiciary speech to prove itself.
The pilot program is paid for, Hughes said, will end in 2027, and “will produce data and information” that lawmakers can use to decide to move forward.

Many of those released on bond today struggle with addiction, Hughes said, and could use help staying on the right track while they await trial.
“We have to do better than we’re doing,” said Hughes. “So the goal of all of this is to connect individuals with people who are concerned, and who have some sensitivity toward addiction issues.”
Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, pushed back on the notion that South Dakota has no business focusing its attention on racial and ethnic disparities. Wittman said she wanted “to remind this body that we do have racial disparities in our justice system.”
“In South Dakota, more than 50% of our incarcerated women are Indigenous and more than 30% of our incarcerated men are Indigenous, while they only make up 8% of our state’s population,” Wittman said.
Rep. Mike Stevens, R-Yankton, the bill’s prime sponsor, said he trusts that no one in the Legislature would allow a nonprofit organization to turn South Dakota into San Francisco. 
“This really isn’t supposed to be a vote on whether you like MacArthur Foundation or not,” Stevens said. “It’s really about ‘what are we going to do to help our state, our South Dakota.’” 
Stevens also said people are released on bond every day in South Dakota, and that judges don’t lose any of that authority under the bill. Most people released on bond are not monitored now, he said. 
The only place where they are is Minnehaha County, which has opted to do things like remind defendants of court appearances since 2018. Missed court appearances there have fallen 40%, Stevens said. 
Wittman announced her intent to seek reconsideration of the bill. If a majority opts to reopen debate, the bill could have another chance.

Escalation in Nebraska divide over state Brand Committee,Juan Salinas II,,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2026/01/26/branding-problem-escalation-in-nebraska-divide-over-state-brand-committee/,A bill to eliminate self-funded state agency comes after it explained why it hasn’t followed part of a state law since 2021.,"A feedlot in Grand Island on Dec. 30, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Brand Committee could be gone. 
A bill from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair would eliminate the governor-appointed state branding committee and transfer its responsibilities to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture, which is run by a gubernatorial appointee. The proposal, Legislative Bill 1258, would make brand inspection voluntary, instead of required. 
Nebraska has a quirky branding law that applies only to cattle owners in the western two-thirds of the state, where the Brand Committee is responsible for investigating cattle theft and verifying ownership through branding when cattle are bought, sold or moved within or beyond the branding zone set in state law. Its services are funded entirely through fees, not by taxpayers. 
The proposal is the latest escalation in a divide over the future of the committee among rural and agricultural constituencies that flared up last legislative session. A  north-central rural lawmaker said the bill is “trying to create a mockery” out of one of the state’s most valuable industries.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. April 17, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
It comes after the Brand Committee explained in a Jan. 15 social media statement that it hadn’t been following part of a state law change from 2021, following a complaint filed with Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers’s office. 
The Attorney General’s Office declined to provide more information on the complaint. 
Don Arp, the committee’s executive director, posted that the group had chosen to continue charging $20 per head of cattle inspection surcharge instead of calculating the state-required fee for the actual miles traveled by the inspectors to reach each inspection. The group’s post said the committee planned to start using the state-required system after the complaint.

Said Hansen: “The way we address branding in the state of Nebraska doesn’t seem like an efficient use of taxpayer dollars … or an efficient use of the producers’ time and their money.” 
Nebraska does it differently
Other cattle-feeding states, including Texas and Oklahoma, deal with cattle branding differently. Branding isn’t mandatory in those states but is encouraged to deter theft, while brand inspections are mandatory in Wyoming and Colorado. 
Nebraska’s livestock branding law was tweaked in 2021 to reduce inspection fees, provide advance notice of a branding inspection and transition from a flat surcharge to a charge for the miles traveled for each inspection, according to the Midwest Messenger. 
State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, of west-central Nebraska, proposed a bill last session that would exempt feedlots from branding and inspection fees under the state’s livestock branding law. Livestock brings in over $12 billion into the state’s economy annually, according to the state Ag Department.

The bill advanced to final reading after Ibach amended it to add a one-time $1,000 payment to apply for feedlots to obtain brand-exempt status, and to exempt dairy cattle. State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, a rural lawmaker from north-central, expressed concerns about lawmakers making an uninformed decision about the future of the committee. 
Ibach told the Examiner she supports Hansen’s proposal, calling it a solution that “best serves Nebraska’s cattle producers.” She was “disappointed” that her bill didn’t pass last year, and still wants it to pass, but said “action this year is imperative.” 
“To remain competitive and sustainable in the future, the time has come to act to protect Nebraska’s cattle industry,” Ibach said. She said Hansen’s proposal “provides additional oversight to ensure proper enforcement of the law.”
Questions about need for change
Storer told KNEB in Scottsbluff-Gering that the cattle industry has to remain open-minded about changes, “but anything that degrades or erodes that basic provision for proof of ownership is not acceptable.”
State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman. Feb. 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“They’re not in the cattle business,” Storer told the Rural Radio Network about her legislative colleagues “They don’t understand the cattle business, but they’re willing to take a sledgehammer and try to destroy a system of proof of inspection.”
She said the Branding Committee is about preserving the integrity of a very valuable asset in the state, referring to cattle. 
Storer told the Examiner Monday that lawmakers who sponsored the bill probably “listened to a handful of feedlot owners who have hired a lobbyist to represent them” to paint a picture of the system they say is “out of date or unfair.”
“When four or five businesses come in and ask to be deregulated, that does not warrant grounds for deregulation,” Storer said. “I don’t feel like all segments of the industry have been fairly represented in this discussion.”
The Nebraska Cattlemen said it would meet later this week to decide its stance on the proposal. The Nebraska Farm Bureau is also currently reviewing the legislation. Last session, many urban lawmakers chose not to weigh in on the rural debate. Hansen said he expected another “spirited” debate. 
In a hint of how heated — Storer has filed an amendment to Hansen’s proposal that would change the bill’s name to the “Livestock Dead Capitol Act” from the “Livestock Protection Act.”

Jay Inslee announced her appointment in 2019. (Photo courtesy of the governor's office)State Supreme Court Justice Raquel Montoya-Lewis, the first Native American elected statewide in Washington’s history, won’t seek reelection for a second term on the high court. 
Montoya-Lewis has been on the court since 2020. She’ll serve out her term, which ends Dec. 31, leaving the seat open for election this year. 
It means there will be elections for at least two open state Supreme Court seats this fall, as Justice Charles Johnson is stepping aside.
Montoya-Lewis announced her decision to colleagues Thursday and publicly Monday. She didn’t give a clear reason why she was leaving, but said the role has been an “honor.”
“I am excited for the coming year on the court and then continuing my career answering the call to do justice, a call I have followed throughout my career,” Montoya-Lewis said in a statement. 
“While I will step away from my work as a justice at the end of 2026, I have no plans to retire,” she continued. “I look forward to writing books, teaching and mentoring law students, lawyers and judges, and building and learning new ways to create a more equitable world.”
Montoya-Lewis, 57, is a member of the Pueblo of Isleta tribe and a descendant of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe, both of which are in New Mexico. Upon her appointment by then-Gov. Jay Inslee, she was believed to be the second Native American state Supreme Court justice in the country. 
The state Supreme Court is going through a period of turnover. 
Last year, Justice Sal Mungia joined the bench after a tight election for the seat vacated by the retirement of the late Susan Owens. 
Justice Mary Yu retired last year, leaving a seat open for Gov. Bob Ferguson to appoint. He tapped Colleen Melody, who was the civil rights division chief at the attorney general’s office. In that role, she worked for years under Ferguson in his time as attorney general. She was sworn into the court last week, and will be up for election this year to serve the remainder of Yu’s term through 2028.
And Johnson, the court’s longest-serving active justice, is set to retire as he turns 75 this year. The state constitution requires justices to retire at the end of the calendar year in which they turn 75. Johnson has been on the court since 1991.
King County Superior Court Judge Sean O’Donnell and David Shelvey have filed for election to replace Johnson. Shelvey ran for the seat Mungia won in 2024 and finished a distant fourth in the primary.
On Monday, Division 1 Court of Appeals Judge J. Michael Diaz filed to run for Montoya-Lewis’ seat. Inslee appointed him to the appellate court in 2022. Before that, Diaz was a King County Superior Court judge. President Barack Obama had nominated him to the U.S. District Court bench in western Washington, but the nomination expired without U.S. Senate confirmation.
In 2022, Montoya-Lewis took medical leave from the court before later returning.
Before joining the Supreme Court, she served five years on the Whatcom County Superior Court. Inslee’s appointment of Montoya-Lewis to that position made her the only Native American judge serving on a superior court in Washington. And before that, she was a tribal court judge for multiple tribes in the region.
She also taught at Western Washington University’s Fairhaven College. She’s been a major advocate for implicit bias training among court officials.
While on the court, she authored notable opinions to keep children with Native American heritage with their families and expand protections to stave off racism in civil court cases.
Writing for Seattle Met in 2020, the justice recalled a reporter asking her what she would tell people who thought she got a leg up for her Supreme Court appointment due to her heritage.
“Every time I’ve done well in anything, people want to chalk it up to being given some kind of special treatment. And the reverse has been true,” Montoya-Lewis wrote. “In my experience, I have had to overcome other people’s views about my abilities rather than being given some sort of extra credit for being Native.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/montoyalewis-1024x819.jpg,,,2026-01-26 20:57:29.975893

The legislation’s aims are laudable. But several of its proposed restrictions on data collection and use are likely to hurt small businesses — which employ nearly 45 percent of the state’s workers and are critical to our economy.  
I’ve spent years studying information-privacy law and policy. Data privacy undoubtedly needs the Legislature’s attention: It would take months — literally — for consumers to read the privacy policies for all the websites they visit annually. But data-privacy regulations need to strike just the right balance — because in today’s digital economy, small businesses rely on data-powered tools to grow and succeed. 
Nearly two-thirds of small businesses, for instance, use data-powered ads to connect with customers. As an example, if you’ve been searching online for new hiking boots, you might get a digital ad from your local outdoors store. The store isn’t surveilling you; instead, its digital partners send the ads to devices where data indicates a good match for the store’s offerings.  
That highly precise advertising helps the store find likely customers without wasting money advertising to unlikely customers, allowing it to compete with big players like Dick’s Sporting Goods or REI, who can afford to run multimillion-dollar ad campaigns.  
Small businesses also benefit from insights provided by data-analytics tools. These tools identify trends in aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, helping business owners see things like how visitors arrive at their website — say, by clicking on an ad or social media post — and what regions customers come from.  
Those insights help business owners make smart decisions about everything from how to spend a limited marketing budget, to where to open a new brick-and-mortar location. Eighty-six percent of Massachusetts small businesses use data to enhance their marketing efforts. 
The data privacy legislation offers a number of sensible provisions, including strict rules for handling sensitive data, requirements for guarding against data breaches, and a prohibition on sending kids targeted ads. Here’s where it goes too far for small businesses: As currently written, the Mass. Data Privacy Act would limit businesses to collecting and processing only the minimum data necessary to deliver a specific, customer-requested product or service. That would dramatically reduce the data available for the advertising, marketing, and analysis purposes that are so valuable to small businesses. 
The bill’s proposed limitations would hit small businesses hard. With less data to inform ad placement, Massachusetts small businesses’ ads would become less effective. That means the businesses would have to spend more money on ads that would likely generate fewer sales — dealing a blow to their bottom line. Bay State small businesses would also struggle to compete against out-of-state rivals, who wouldn’t face the same restrictions, and would lose ground to deep-pocketed corporate competitors who could still afford to market and advertise their products. 
The proposed data privacy law would apply to companies that collect the data of 60,000 or more consumers. That threshold would be among the lowest in the nation, and far lower than the 100,000-consumer threshold that exists in half of the states that have passed consumer privacy laws, including Connecticut and California. In Europe, similar regulations led to disproportionately high compliance costs for small businesses, as compared to larger businesses. The bill pending in the Legislature would likely have the same impact on Massachusetts small businesses, overburdening the businesses least able to bear its costs — and who pose the least risk to consumers.  
I support lawmakers’ efforts to protect consumers’ privacy, but I urge them to reconsider the data privacy act’s application to small businesses. Other states have shown that it’s possible to safeguard consumer data while still allowing small businesses to grow, compete, and succeed. Massachusetts can do the same by crafting balanced rules that protect privacy without hurting businesses that form the lifeblood of our economy.

More than half of California’s Democratic legislative caucus called for a government shutdown and introduced bills to hold federal agents accountable


California legislative Democrats are urging their congressional colleagues to shut down the federal government and block further funding to immigration enforcement agencies after agents shot and killed another civilian in Minnesota over the weekend.
At least 50 Democratic state senators and assemblymembers — more than half the party’s caucus — on Monday decried the slaying of Alex Pretti, the Minneapolis resident and Veterans Affairs intensive care nurse who on Saturday was gunned down by federal immigration enforcement agents. 
The lawmakers proclaimed their solidarity with Minnesota and other cities and states that have been targeted by federal law enforcement agents. They railed against what they called the Trump administration’s militarization of American cities as some wiped away tears.
The previously bipartisan spending package, which would fund the departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, awaits a vote in the U.S. Senate, where an increasing number of Democrats have vowed to filibuster it. 
But California lawmakers warned that Senate Democrats, many of whom represent battleground states, might cave and give Republicans the votes they need to push the measure to President Donald Trump’s desk.
“This message is for Sen. Chuck Schumer,” said Assemblymember Liz Ortega, Democrat of Hayward. “Do your job. Stand for something. Don’t fold again.”
Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, Democrat of Salinas, called for Schumer to “step aside” if he couldn’t keep his caucus in lockstep.
Rivas and his colleagues also had a message for Republican lawmakers. 
“We need you to speak out. You cannot watch these videos coming out of Minneapolis, Minn. and think that this is acceptable,” Rivas said. “We need your voice, we need your solidarity, and standing up for American values.”
In reference to the fact that Pretti was apparently carrying a permitted weapon, Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez of Los Angeles quoted a 2018 tweet from the late Charlie Kirk, which stated that the Second Amendment wasn’t for hunting or self protection, but “to ensure that free people can defend themselves if, god forbid, government became tyrannical and turned against its citizens.”
“What do you call a masked agent killing people in the street? What do you call children being taken from families?” Gonzalez said. 
He noted that the National Rifle Association condemned premature conclusions about the shooting as “dangerous and wrong.”
“Even the NRA is calling out the dangerous ignorance of federal officials trying to excuse the killing of Alex Pretti,” Gonzalez said. “When even staunch defenders of the Second Amendment recognize the need for accountability, we must listen.”

So far, California Republicans have targeted their criticism mainly at Democrats. Republican legislative leadership deferred to other members of their caucus when asked for comment. 
Sen. Tony Strickland, Republican of Huntington Beach, said Democratic officials have created risky and unsafe conditions for both the agents and civilian onlookers through so-called “sanctuary” policies that limit local and state law enforcement from working with federal immigration agents. They argue that those policies create risky situations where civilians like Pretti feel they need to monitor and track officers. 
“Stop the rhetoric that ICE agents are Gestapo, that they’re secret police, that they’re Nazis,” said Assemblymember James Gallagher of Chico, the former Republican Assembly leader who recently announced his bid for the special election to fulfill the final months of the late Rep. Doug LaMalfa’s congressional term. “This type of rhetoric is helping to contribute to the chaotic environment in places like Minnesota.”
Gallagher called Pretti’s death a “terrible thing” and called for an independent investigation and accountability. 
Legislation calls for greater ICE oversight
Some lawmakers are committing to introduce new measures to curtail the power of federal agents. 
“Certainly this is a frustrating situation because so much of the power and the authority here is in the hands of the federal government in Washington, D.C., but that doesn’t mean that the answer for us is to do nothing,” said Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, Democrat of Encino. 
Gabriel plans to introduce a bill that would require the California attorney general to conduct an independent investigation into any shooting by federal immigration enforcement agents in the state, an extension of an existing law that already requires such investigations for shootings by local and state law enforcement. He will also co-author a bill with Assemblymember Juan Carrillo that would ban federal immigration enforcement agencies from using state resources to facilitate their operations, such as staging equipment and personnel on state property.
“We have to use every tool at our disposal, every lawful opportunity that we have to use our power, our authority to think of all of the different ways that we can push back,” Gabriel said.
Also on deck for a vote in the California Senate this week is Senate Bill 747 co-authored by Sen. Aisha Wahab of Hayward and Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who is running to replace Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi in Congress, that would allow Californians to sue federal agents for civil rights violations. The bill builds upon Wiener’s measure from last year that banned federal immigration enforcement agents from wearing masks, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law.
Wiener argued that the issue should not be partisan.
“This is really about everyone’s rights under any federal administration,” Wiener told CalMatters on Monday. “Local and state law enforcement are already subject to civil rights liability if they violate someone’s rights, and federal agents effectively are not,” he said. 
“This is simply seeking to apply the same standards for all law enforcement.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012426_ICEProtestSF_JK_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 20:57:29.975893

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)U.S. Senate candidate and former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper called for “immediate reforms” before any additional funding for ICE and Border Patrol operations following the deaths of two Minneapolis activists during altercations with federal agents.
“The federal government should deport violent criminals, but instead they have killed American citizens,” Cooper said in a statement on social media Monday afternoon. “Americans deserve answers and any additional funding for these ICE operations must come with immediate reforms that stop this chaos and keep people safe.”
The call for reform comes two days after the two-term Democratic governor first condemned federal immigration enforcement for the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. “These horrific shootings in Minnesota should not have happened,” he said. “American citizens should not be targeted and killed.”

The campaign of Michael Whatley, Cooper’s expected 2026 general election opponent, did not respond to a request for comment. His campaign had not addressed the Minnesota shootings on its social media as of Monday afternoon.
In November, Whatley lauded “strong, decisive action” from the Trump administration when Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents were operating in Charlotte, writing on social media, “The highest function of any government is to keep its citizens safe.”
The National Republican Senatorial Committee, responded to Cooper but did not address his call for reform, zeroing in on another part of his statement: “As attorney general and governor, I locked up violent criminals to keep people safe.”
“Tell us more about how you ‘locked up violent criminals to keep people safe,’” the NRSC responded on X.
The post included a still image from the surveillance footage of last year’s killing of Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte public transportation. Republicans have argued that although Cooper was not governor at the time, he bears the responsibility for the attack because the alleged assailant was released from state prison under his administration after serving his full sentence. The North Carolina Republican Party reposted the criticism.

In response, Cooper campaign spokesman Jordan Monaghan said the attack on the former governor’s record was a distraction.
“Roy Cooper is the only candidate who spent his career prosecuting violent criminals and keeping thousands of them behind bars as attorney general, and signing tough on crime laws and stricter pretrial release bail policy as governor,” Monaghan said.
Cooper’s call for conditions on funding echoes those of U.S. Senate Democrats, nearly all of whom oppose additional funding for Homeland Security without restrictions on immigration enforcement operations. That standoff could potentially lead to a partial government shutdown.
Some Republicans have also voiced concerns over the shootings. On Sunday, Sen. Thom Tillis, whose seat Cooper and Whatley are vying to fill, urged a “thorough and impartial investigation” into Pretti’s death. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called on the heads of ICE, Border Patrol, and USCIS to testify before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Monday afternoon.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3632-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 20:57:29.975893

(Photo by Scott Housley/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Young children would still be required to get vaccinated before entering a Florida school or day care, but it would be easier for parents and guardians to opt out of those vaccinations under a bill passed by the Senate Health Policy Committee Monday afternoon.
In addition to addressing school vaccine requirements, SB 1756 would allow Florida pharmacists to provide ivermectin to adults without a prescription as a behind-the counter medication until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves it for over-the-counter sale. Ivermectin has been approved by the FDA for certain parasitic infections but federal guidelines require a prescription.
SB 1756 cleared the Senate Health Policy Committee by a 6-4 vote with longtime Stuart Republican state Sen. Gayle Harrell joining Democrats to oppose the measure. But at least two other senators — Health Policy Committee Chair Colleen Burton, a Winter Haven Republican, and Inverness Republican Sen. Ralph Masullo, a dermatologist — said the bill needed to change for them to support it in the future.
“As we know, this is a step in the process, and I’d like to see it much better going forward,” Massullo told the sponsor, Jacksonville Republican Sen. Clay Yarborough.
Specifically, the bill would allow parents to opt out of vaccines based on their conscience. Today, parents are allowed to opt out for medical or religious reasons.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo made national headlines in September when they announced they’d like to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes and regulations, a move that could affect schoolchildren but also college students and even nursing home residents.
Ladapo said at the time that mandates drip “with disdain and slavery” and that legislators would have to “pick a side” in the vaccine debate.
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

Florida law requires immunization for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus for entry and attendance in Florida schools, childcare facilities, and family daycare homes.
Yarborough’s s bill wouldn’t change that. But the bill would require providers who vaccinate minors to provide parents or guardians with information about the risks, benefits, safety, and efficacy of each vaccine being administered. The information provided to the parents would be produced by the Florida Board of Medicine and the Florida Board Ostepathic Medicine (whose members answer to the governor.)
Additionally, before giving a vaccines to a minor the bill would require providers to get a parent or guardian’s signature affirming they’ve been provided the requisite information. The bill would require health care providers s to discuss with parents and guardians the administration of multiple vaccines at once and offer alternative timing options.
The bill would not, however, require parents who don’t want to vaccinate their children to have the same conversations or have forms signed by providers attesting they’ve been provided information about vaccines. Harrell argued it had been longstanding policy at the Florida Department of Health to require consultations for parents who opt out but that the DeSantis administration reversed the policy during COVID.
Harrell is considered a top Republican voice in the Senate on health care policy; her husband, now deceased, was an obstetrician-gynecologist and she helped operate his clinics. She offered an amendment to the bill that would have made the DOH also require parents who opt out of vaccinating their children to Florida licensed physicians sign forms attesting they discussed the benefits and risks associated with the vaccinations with parents.
“We are about to go down a road that’s going to create a major problem for children but also seniors … who can’t be vaccinated,” she said. “We will wind up with outbreaks of very devastating diseases such as polio — and I had a grandmother who had polio and I know how devastating that it,” said Harrell.
It was shot down at the request of Yarborough, who said it was an added barrier that wasn’t needed.
Another Harrell-sponsored amendment was adopted by the committee, though. It would provide civil, criminal, and administrative protections to medical doctors, osteopathic physicians, and advanced nurses who prescribe or administer ivermectin to adults.
Who’s in the driver’s seat?
Senate Health Policy Committee Chair Burton noted that Yarborough said SB 1756 would help put parents back in the “drivers seat.” But Burton said that the parents who testified before the committee Monday said the bill would do the exact opposite.
“We heard from a number of parents today who don’t feel like they’re in the driver seat if we pass this bill today,” she said. “I know you’ve heard that before because you’re a thoughtful person and you  listen to everybody,” she said.
“We have the challenge of weighing the rights and responsibilities of all parents, right? We lean one way or another, we will be leaving somebody out and potentially we’ll be endangering some students. And if we give parents the driver seat that allows them additional exemptions to not vaccinate their children, then I’m not sure what seat that leaves some of the other parents when they don’t have options of where to send their children to school because every school has to accept these children, including private institutions.”
While Masullo voted for the bill, he said his future support also was incumbent upon changes.
“You know our governor today was talking about MAHA (Make America Health Again) and making our country greater by making our population healthier. Vaccines is part of that. And we would need to remove some of these — I’d call false — statements about vaccines and have people believe the truth. But the only way they’re going to do that is we make the truth evident to them,” he said.
More than one
SB 1756 isn’t the only vaccine-related bill the Senate has discussed to date.
The Senate Committee on Regulated Industries last week voted to approve SB 408. Specifically, the bill would amend Florida law regulating drugs and cosmetics to allow an individual to file a lawsuit within three years following an alleged vaccine-related injury. The bill would provide one-way attorney fees, allowing any claimant who wins to recover “reasonable attorney fees” but not allow winning defendants to do the same.

Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, is pushing a proposal (SB 626) to amend statutes to require the vaccines (hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus influenzae type b, and pneumococcal disease) Ladapo is trying to eliminate via rule.
That bill has been referred to the Senate Health Policy, Education Pre-K-12, and Rules committees. But that proposal hasn’t been heard yet.

The bill targets decisions by school districts to raise more revenue by “opting out” of property tax limitations imposed by the state. Local residents can already petition a board’s opt-out decision to a public vote, but there is no requirement for an election if nobody organizes a petition drive.

Under the bill, a school board could approve an opt-out with a two-thirds vote, but the decision would then go to a mandatory election. The bill also requires boards to spell out not only the number of years an opt-out would run, but the “total maximum dollar amount of taxes payable over the full term.”
There are 79 active school district opt-outs across South Dakota, according to data from the Legislative Research Council, resulting in a combined total of $43 million in excess property taxes.
Sen. Sue Peterson, R-Sioux Falls, introduced the bill, which was recommended by lawmakers on last summer’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force.
The bill aims to provide property tax relief and increase accountability among school districts and boards, Peterson told lawmakers, adding that the current system is “making spending limits obsolete.”
“It only makes sense that the burden should be on the school boards to get direct consent from the people if they want to circumvent spending limits,” Peterson said. “It should not be the responsibility of the people to gather petition signatures to prevent over-the-limit spending.”
Opponents of the bill said taxpayer dollars would be spent on unnecessary elections since many referred opt-outs are upheld by voters. Sen. Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, said that school board members decide to opt out because of inadequate state funding.

At the same time, Utah Republican state leaders say there needs to be a de-escalation from both political sides. However, they made no comments on how the Trump administration has characterized the killing.

“In everything I’ve ever been involved in that’s been very controversial, and this surely is, it takes two sides, and I think you’ve got to figure it out, and it’d be really nice if we find a way to de-escalate it,” Utah Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said on Monday. “And I think there’s rhetoric on both sides. And I really feel like, right now, whatever we say, we’re going to spin it up, and I don’t want to spin it up. I want to spin it down. I just think we know better how to treat each other and what’s happening there is not right.”
For Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, there’s blame to be placed “on the far right and the far left.” The lack of action from Congress has led to the current situation, he told reporters on Monday.
“I think if Congress would get its crap together and act and come up with a reasonable solution to fix our broken immigration system, a lot of these things would go away,” Schultz said. “And it’s not that hard.”
As protests against the tactics of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement emerge nationwide, including in Salt Lake City, elected officials are also thinking about plans to mitigate violence in Utah demonstrations, with Schultz saying the state promotes peaceful protest but will not tolerate violence.



Let us know what you think...


 


Adams, who described Pretti’s killing as “just horrible,” said Utah has been able to “manage things well.”
“Does anybody like the loss of a life? I mean, that’s just crazy. It’s not a positive thing,” Adams said. “And yet, you know, law enforcement has a really tough job.” 
But, when asked how the Trump administration is handling the Minneapolis situation and about whether they believe the administration’s description of the shooting was accurate, Adams asked other members of the Senate leadership for thoughts, but only got one answer from Sen. Jerry Stevenson, R-Layton.
“I would really like to discuss Utah issues,” Stevenson said.
Schultz said he hasn’t seen the video of the shooting, so he wouldn’t get into the specifics of the case.
Graphic video captured by witnesses shows six federal agents appearing to wrestle Pretti to the ground and 10 shots can be heard. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Congress hurtles toward partial shutdown after Alex Pretti killing in Minneapolis

The Department of Homeland Security said Saturday morning “this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” However, video shows an agent approaching Pretti as he was being held on the ground and then walking away with what appeared to be a gun in his hand before shots were fired.
Like Curtis, Schultz said he would also be in favor of an investigation on the shooting.
“Again, we’re all sitting here, and I don’t think any of us can agree on what exactly happened. And so I think having a better understanding of what happened, I think, is important,” he said.
But, he added, it is the responsibility of the federal government to handle immigration issues.
“I’m going to come back to collaboration. This wouldn’t happen in Utah and it shouldn’t happen in Minnesota,” he said. “They need to find a way to come together for the benefit of the citizens of this state of Minnesota, and that’s the state, and the locals, and the federal government.”
Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, said there are a lot of concerns and fear among families in Utah.
“We’re prepping, understanding that there’s no control as a state in terms of what the federal government does for that, and that we can exercise all of our tools in our toolbox to make sure that we protect our residents and our citizens in the state of Utah,” Escamilla said.
Additionally, Escamilla said to expect Utah House and Senate members to ask the state’s congressional delegation to push for more oversight of Department of Homeland Security actions.
Amid the turmoil, U.S. Senate Democrats are insisting on a renegotiation of Homeland Security spending to include more constraints on federal immigration enforcement. If an agreement is not reached by Friday, there may be a partial government shutdown.
Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee said he would oppose any effort to defund the Department of Homeland Security and has called multiple times to send in the national guard to Minneapolis on his X account. 
“We’re not defunding ICE. Live with it.” he wrote Sunday.

(Screengrab from virtual hearing)A New Mexico district judge on Monday denied social media giant Meta’s requests to limit news sources from streaming or recording an upcoming trial in Santa Fe regarding allegations of child exploitation on its websites.
New Mexico First Judicial District Judge Bryan Biedscheid gave his ruling from the bench late Monday morning saying that Meta’s concerns of “security matters” did not meet the standards to outweigh public interest in the case.
“While this court is sensitive to a point about concerns related to future trials and concerns about security and the like, the court does not find that, on balance, those outweigh the public’s right to understand,” Biedscheid said.
The New Mexico Foundation for Open Government and five media organizations sought to intervene in the case. Chuck Peifer, the attorney representing the media organizations and NMFOG, told the court that limiting video and recording would be a “significant impingement” on public access to the courtroom.
“When you say there’s no video and there’s no audio, you can only have print, which means that the public only gets to hear a narrative third-party description of what happened in the courtroom,” Peifer said.
The decision marks the latest development in the case against the company that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, spurred by the 2023 civil lawsuit brought by New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez. In the complaint, the New Mexico Department of Justice alleges that Meta and CEO Mark Zuckerberg “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on the internet.
At the conclusion of the hearing, Biedscheid said he would consider making limitations on a more specific level for certain witnesses or evidence shown in the courtroom at a future date, saying he is not “oblivious or insensitive to specific concerns.”
“I, at this point, am focused on the broadest concern, and that is making it clear that there can be livestreaming video and audio that will be allowed throughout the trial,” he said.
Jury selection for the trial is scheduled to start on Feb. 2.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The New Mexico House Judiciary Committee on Monday quickly passed legislation that would enter the state into seven health care worker compacts, part of lawmakers’ effort to pass as many compact bills as possible despite Senate opposition.
House legislators in both parties say the compacts are necessary to help reduce health care worker shortages in a variety of fields. Joining the compacts reduces licensure requirements and therefore barriers for health care workers to move to New Mexico and work here. 
The House and Senate Republicans have pushed for the compacts for several years. Senate Democrats have opposed them, though they agreed this session under mounting pressure to advance legislation entering the state into compacts for doctors and social workers. 
NM Senate passes interstate medical compact bill

The seven compacts the House committee passed Monday afternoon include physicians assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, dentists, dental hygienists and paramedics.
The committee did not hear two other pieces of compact legislation for counselors and psychologists. Rep. Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque), who sponsored those bills, is still working on substitute versions of the bills that reflect the language preferences of the compacts she’s seeking to join. 
House Democrats celebrated the passage of the bills, which are now headed to the House floor. 
“By joining interstate compacts, New Mexico can expand access to vital healthcare services —  from counseling and physical therapy to emergency medical services and dentistry — all across the state,” Rep. Liz Thomson (D-Albuquerque), chair of the Health and Human Services Committee and lead sponsor of five of the compact bills, said in a statement.  Thomson’s committee passed the nine compacts last week. 
Should the additional compact bills pass the House as expected, House leaders said in a statement Monday afternoon they are “hopeful” the bills have enough support in both chambers.
Senate Democratic leaders, however, have argued against passing more than the social worker and doctor compacts.

Wes Moore (D), in an interview on CNN Monday signaled a willingness to back a partial federal government shutdown over aggressive immigration enforcement. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) said he hates the thought of another government shutdown, but he also said that there needs to be some accountability for federal immigration officers who are using increasingly aggressive tactics that have led to the shooting deaths of two protesters in Minneapolis this month.
Moore, during an interview Monday with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, signaled a willingness to back threats by members of his own party in Congress to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security — a move that could lead to a partial government shutdown this weekend.
“Just the idea that we should have a government shutdown, it hurts my state more than any state in the country,” Moore said on CNN. “But I also know this: We cannot continue to allow this funding of the 13th-largest military force, by funding, in the world to continue to exist where there is no accountability, where people are not trained, and where we’re watching these travesties happening in our communities every single day.”
Moore’s comments come as Senate Democrats are threatening to block a vote on the Homeland Security budget after the shooting by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis Saturday of Alex Pretti, 37, an intensive care nurse with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Pretti’s shooting came just over two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis.
The DHS budget is one of six that need to be approved by Friday before current funding runs out. Those budgets were passed last week by the House and appeared headed toward approval in the Senate, but that was derailed by the fatal shooting of Pretti. Senate Democrats are now demanding that the DHS budget, which includes funding for ICE and Border Patrol, be renegotiated.
Deadly shooting in Minneapolis could lead to partial government shutdown over ICE funding

“I hate government shutdowns,” Moore said in the CNN interview. He noted that Maryland lost 25,000 jobs to federal workforce reductions in the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term. Maryland, which is home to tens of thousands of government workers and contractors, also suffered through last fall’s 43-day shutdown, the longest in U.S. history.
At the same time, Moore said the aggressive enforcement in Minnesota and other states “needs to stop.” The fatal shootings in Minneapolis are “not just heartbreaking, it’s just deeply against American values and what our values … should be.”
The governor added he is concerned that an increased ICE presence and enforcement could come to Maryland.
“You know, there are already ICE agents who are patrolling throughout the state of Maryland and in other states around the country,” Moore said.
“We have a lack of clarity on values, a lack of clarity on mission, a lack of clarity on what the end game is, and frankly, a lack of clarity on what accountability actually looks like,” Moore said. “The president as the commander in chief, he needs to provide commander’s intent.”
Moore then tied his efforts to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts to efforts to protect Marylanders from federal government overreach.
“It’s the reason that we are pushing to ensure that we are going to fight back against this lawlessness in every way that we see it to include the governor’s redistricting Advisory Commission that I put forward to ensure that we can have maps that actually reflect the values of our people,” Moore said.
“There is nothing that I will not do to make sure that my people are protected against the type of atrocities that we are seeing,” he said, “and there is nothing that the state of Maryland will not do to show that we are willing to lead even when it is tough.”

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The New Mexico Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee on Monday unanimously advanced a bill allocating $547 million for a new University of New Mexico School of Medicine, something Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham labeled a priority in her final State of the State address. 
Senate Bill 6, a one-page bill, would direct nearly $547 million from the state general fund to the university Board of Regents to build and furnish a new school by 2030. Supporters of the bill, including sponsor Sen. George Muñoz, (D-Gallup), said it would provide a much-needed facelift to a 65-year-old school, double the number of medical students and ease the state’s physician shortage. The school currently produces nearly 40% of the practicing physicians across the state.
“I go to Arizona a lot. There’s not a 65-year-old building on Arizona State University’s campus,” Muñoz said.
The overall project will cost about $600 million, according to the university. Plans call for building the 330,000 square-foot facility on the northeast corner of University and Lomas boulevards, near the existing UNM Hospital. 
Both chambers of the Legislature have taken up causes to address New Mexico’s physician shortage. The state Senate voted 40-0 on Friday to pass Senate Bill 1, known as the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Act. Supporters say the legislation would make it easier for licensed health care professionals from other states to practice in New Mexico.
Although the committee voted 10-0 to advance the UNM bill, some Republicans expressed concern over the dollar amount. Since late 2025, state economists have warned that lawmakers will have to deal with reduced spending in setting the upcoming fiscal year’s budget. Of particular concern is recurring spending, such as hiring new government employees. Lawmakers have said that non-recurring spending, such as construction projects, is less of a concern. 
“$550 million does suck a lot of oxygen out of the NM non-recurring budget,” Sen. Larry Scott (R-Hobbs) said at the hearing.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/senate-health-and-public-affairs-1024x816.jpg,,,2026-01-26 19:56:33.654986

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)With less than three weeks to go until their deadline, conservative groups collecting signatures as part of an effort to repeal Utah’s voter-approved independent redistricting law known as Proposition 4 still have a long way to go in order to qualify their effort for the 2026 ballot. 
According to the latest tallies recorded to the lieutenant governor’s website Monday morning, county clerks had verified 57,437 signatures submitted by the political issues committee Utahns for Representative Government, which was founded by Utah Republican Party Chairman Rob Axson. 
In order to pose the repeal question to voters on the November ballot, the GOP must collect at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters across Utah while meeting specific thresholds in at least 26 of Utah’s 29 Senate districts. 
That means the group needs to obtain and submit at least 83,311 more valid signatures by Feb. 15 at 5 p.m.
Another redistricting twist: Utah GOP changes tactics to repeal independent map-drawing law

It’s likely, however, the group has collected more signatures than what is currently reflected on the lieutenant governor’s website because totals are posted after county clerks verify signature packets. 
In response to a request for an interview Monday about the effort’s progress, Axson told Utah News Dispatch in a text message that the 57,437 signatures tallied on the lieutenant governor’s website as of Monday morning is “many weeks old,” adding there is a “substantial lag” from when signatures are gathered to when they are verified by clerks and posted online. 
County clerks have 21 days from when they receive each signature gathering packet to verify signatures. The final day for clerks to verify signatures is March 7. 
Trump looks to give repeal effort a boost
As the deadline looms, President Donald Trump looked to give the signature gathering effort a boost Friday, when he posted a call to action to Utahns on Truth Social, calling the Proposition 4 repeal effort “very important” to “KEEP UTAH RED.” 
The president echoed complaints from the Utah Republican Party and GOP lawmakers about the state’s new congressional boundaries recently ordered by a judge to be used for the 2026 elections. The courts determined the 2021 Utah Legislature violated Utahns’ constitutional rights when it repealed and replaced Proposition 4 and adopted a congressional map that year that wasn’t drawn using the measure’s independent commission or neutral map-drawing standards.
After determining the Utah Legislature’s proposed remedial map again didn’t adhere to Proposition 4’s neutral standards meant to guard against gerrymandering, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson chose an alternative map drawn by plaintiffs in the redistricting lawsuit that she concluded did adhere to map-drawing standards outlined by Proposition 4, which she restored as law. 
Utah’s court-ordered map created a Democratic-majority congressional district concentrated around northern Salt Lake County and three Republican districts — to the dismay of the state’s Republican leaders. The Legislature has pledged to appeal that decision to the Utah Supreme Court.
Utah Democrats likely to win congressional seat in 2026 if judge’s map order stands

“Utahns deserve Maps drawn by those they elect, not Rogue Judges or Leftwing Activists who never faced the Voters, and, therefore, I encourage all Patriotic Utahns, Republicans, and MAGA Supporters who love their Great State and Country to sign this initiative, ASAP,” Trump posted, while urging Utahns to attend signature gathering events held over the weekend across the state. 
Axson, chairman of the Utah Republican Party, applauded Trump’s post in a statement shared to social media, saying, “it is evident from the President’s message that he deeply cares about Utah, its people, and our future.”
“We greatly appreciate his help to share the message of representative government and constitutional order so that Utah remains true to conservative principles,” Axson said. 
It’s not yet clear how much of a bump Trump’s post may have given the Proposition 4 repeal effort. 
But as they’ve watched, critics of the repeal effort say it’s lagging far behind what it needs to qualify the question for the ballot. 
‘Desperation’
Utah Democratic Party Chairman Brian King called Trump’s Friday statement “desperation — the same strong-arm playbook, trying to intimidate voters instead of facing the truth.” 
“Donald Trump and his Utah Republican backers are desperate because they’re finally starting to come to terms with how unpopular their gerrymandering scam actually is,” King said. “Utahns already voted on Prop 4 and made it crystal clear that they demand fair maps, fair elections, and fair representation.” 
The Utah GOP has enlisted the help of conservative influencer Scott Presler, who over the weekend posted multiple times on X that he was working hard to gather signatures. 
A dark money group that helped finance Trump’s presidential campaign in 2024 is also bankrolling the Proposition 4 repeal effort. The nonprofit Securing American Greatness has contributed more than $4.3 million to Utahns for Representative Government, all of which was spent on its contracted signature gathering company, Patriot Grassroots, according to the group’s financial disclosure reports. 
King said despite throwing millions at the effort, “there’s a reason why Republicans are struggling to get the signatures they need and are parachuting Trump in from the sidelines: Utahns don’t want them to manipulate our elections.” 
5 key Utah redistricting issues to watch in 2026

“If Republicans want to earn voters’ trust, they should stop cheating and start actually listening to what Utahns want,” he said. 
The anti-gerrymandering group Better Boundaries that successfully sought Proposition 4 back in 2018 and other groups are urging Utahns to “decline to sign” the repeal effort, and is also encouraging anyone who did sign to go through a legal process to remove their signatures. 
Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, reacted to Trump’s statement in a video posted to social media with disbelief that the president said “the quiet part out loud” —  that the purpose of the repeal is to “keep Utah red.” 
“Utah’s maps are governed by Utah law, not national politics,” Rasmussen said in a statement issued in response to Trump’s post. 
She went on to say the Utah GOP’s efforts to gather enough signatures was falling flat because it’s not popular with Utahns.
“After burning through millions of dollars, outside actors still can’t get enough Utahns to sign on to repealing the reform voters already passed,” she said. “That tells you everything. If this repeal were popular with Utah voters, it wouldn’t need national megaphones and millions of dollars to survive. Prop 4 was about keeping politicians from picking their voters. Utahns meant it then, and they continue to mean it now.”
What do Utahns think about gerrymandering in Utah?
On Monday, Better Boundaries released a poll it commissioned, conducted by the firm Embold Research, that showed 71% of Utah voters believe there should be neutral, independent standards for redistricting in Utah. The poll also found: 

64% of Utah voters support Proposition 4, including 46% who strongly support and 18% who somewhat support. 
57% of Utah voters disapprove of the Legislature repealing Proposition 4, including 87% of registered Democrats and 68% of unaffiliated voters. About 47% of registered Republicans also disapprove, according to the poll, but a higher share (25%) said they were unsure.

The poll of 1,731 registered Utah voters was conducted Jan. 12-15 has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, according to a summary of its findings issued by Embold Research. 
“We don’t need to spin or hype these numbers,” Rasmussen said in a prepared statement issued with the poll. “It is clear that Utahns want to choose their politicians, and they don’t believe that politicians should have the power to choose their voters.”
Utah GOP lawmakers confident repeal will qualify for ballot
In a media availability with reporters Monday, some Republican legislators said the repeal signature gathering effort is likely going better than people think — and they argued it’s something that should be put to a vote to let Utahns decide Proposition 4’s ultimate fate. 
“I think it’s going really well,” said Senate Majority Assistant Whip Mike McKell, who lives in the conservative city of Spanish Fork.

McKell said his personal business was used as a venue for a signature gathering event for the repeal effort, and “there were a lot of folks in south Utah county that were excited to come in and sign. … There was a lot of interest in my community.” 
Asked about the lagging number of verified signatures posted to the lieutenant governor’s website, McKell said he’s confident “they’ll get the signatures” to qualify the question for the ballot. 
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said he hasn’t been directly involved in the effort, but “you really don’t understand how it’s going … until the last week or two until all the signatures really start to get turned in.” 
“There’s a strategy there to be a little late,” Schultz said, though he added, “I don’t know what’s happening and what’s not happening. But I’m confident that it will likely end up on the ballot.”
Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, noted that Proposition 4 passed by a narrow margin — with 50.34% of the vote — and he argued Utah voters should be given another chance to weigh in on the issue. 
“Now there’s a group that says, ‘We want to try it again and see if enough people will turn it around,” Sandall said, questioning why that’s controversial. 
Asked about Better Boundaries’ poll, Sandall said he thinks a vote on repealing Proposition 4 will be “a lot closer” than the numbers reflected in that poll, based on “when I talk to people, at least, in my area.”

For some colleges still dealing with power outages, that meant ensuring students and others on campus had warm places to retreat to and hot meals regardless of whether they have paid meal plans.
Delta State University, for example, will open its Statesman’s Shelf Food Pantry on Tuesday and Thursday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The Young-Mauldin Cafeteria will be open through Wednesday from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., according to the university. Delta State students and essential staff can eat hot meals in the cafeteria and take home bagged dinners when they stop by for brunch, spokeswoman Suzette Matthews said in an email. Officials aim to return to regular hours and offering three meals a day by Thursday, Matthews said. 
“And we are SO SO thankful for our staff for making this happen,” Matthews said in the email.
In a Monday Facebook post, Delta State President Daniel Ennis noted lingering safety concerns such as icy roads around campus and interruptions in cell phone service. 
“We’re having a cold day on campus, but with power and food; we’re better off than some,” Ennis wrote. “Our facilities crew continues to make progress clearing paths, and the student center has been opened for off-campus students who are still without power.”
K–12 schools across the state are also responding to lingering weather hazards. Roughly half of Mississippi’s public school districts closed or implemented virtual learning on Monday. Dozens plan to remain closed Tuesday or for longer.

The worst might still be ahead as even colder temperatures are forecast for the state overnight, where more than 125,000 residents in its northern and central sections remained without electricity Monday afternoon. 
Icy roads and downed trees are hindering power restoration efforts, with some portions of rural Northeast Louisiana possibly having to wait until Thursday to get reconnected.  
Gov. Jeff Landry urged residents to stay put so that utility crews can continue their work and first responders don’t have to take unnecessary risks to aid stranded motorists.
“Just because a road is passable does not mean it’s safe,” Landry said Tuesday during an update on the state’s response to the weather event.

State climatologist Jay Grymes said much of northern Louisiana will see temperatures down to the teens by Tuesday morning, with single-digits reading possible in some areas. Down in the state’s coastal parishes, readings in the 20s are forecast. 
“Even though we’re done with the freezing rain, the sleet and the snow, we’re still a long way from being out of the woods in terms of the cold,” Grymes said. “The dangerous and potentially deadly cold will continue through the week.”    
An 86-year-old DeSoto Parish man and his two pets were found dead at his home Monday morning, KSLA-TV reported. The state health department attributed his death to carbon monoxide poisoning, and State Fire Marshal Bryan Adams confirmed the man was using a generator in the garage adjacent to his home.  
Over the weekend, the deaths of two unidentified men in Caddo Parish were blamed on the severe cold, one of whom was found near the Shreveport YMCA. 
Louisiana Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein confirmed hypothermia caused their deaths, and he said two more fatalities being investigated are also believed to be from exposure to the subfreezing conditions.
“We think that the hypothermia deaths are avoidable. We really implore you to basically take care of yourself and take care of your neighbors,” said Greenstein, who directed residents to the state’s Get a Game Plan website and cellphone app for more information on warming centers that have been set up around the state. 
More than 60 warming centers were open as of Monday afternoon, and the governor said the state is fielding requests from parishes to open additional locations.

The need for warming centers is expected to last as long as parts of the state struggle to have their power restored. Outages during the winter storm reached 175,000 customers at their peak, Public Service Commission executive director Brandon Frey said. That number had been reduced to 125,000 as of Monday afternoon.
The problem was most severe in rural areas of Northeast Louisiana. In East Carroll Parish, 95% of its nearly 3,400 customers did not have power as of 3:45 p.m. Monday, and almost 60% of West Carroll’s 2,500 customers were in the same predicament, according to the tracking website FindEnergy.com. The outage rate was also high for Richland Parish, where 58% of its 9,200 customers awaited restoration. 
The situation was also acute in Ouachita Parish, where 57% of 83,000 customers didn’t have electricity Monday afternoon. Officials there were also dealing with water service issues. Greenstein said St. Francis Medical Center in Monroe reported it was experiencing low water pressure, though he expected the problem to be resolved shortly.
At the University of Louisiana Monroe, residential halls housing 440 students remained without power, though school officials said they are still safe for students. A warming center was made available on campus.

Entergy Louisiana serves all four parishes and reported the largest number of outages remaining statewide at roughly 84,000. Company CEO Philip May said 90% of its customers that aren’t dealing with access issues to have their power restored, such as closed roads or downed power lines, should have their electricity back by Wednesday. The utility has 4,300 workers in the field handling restoration, May said.  
For Entergy customers where crews can’t access their service lines, it could take until Thursday for their power to come back on. Anyone with home damage from the winter storm will need to consult an electrician to determine if they can have their power restored, May said. 
Some 24,500 SWEPCO customers should have electricity by Wednesday, and the bulk of more than 5,100 CLECO customers are expected to have their power back Tuesday, according to Frey.
More than 1,500 state highway workers are actively clearing roads of ice and debris, Transportation Secretary Glenn Ledet said, and employees from southern Louisiana are being sent north to help.
The governor said his staff has been in touch with the Federal Emergency Management Agency with a request to elevate the federal emergency declaration for Louisiana. The hope is FEMA can provide resources to assist the state with debris clearing, though the Trump administration has slashed funding and personnel at the agency. 
Another round of freezing weather is expected to impact Louisiana this weekend, though Grymes said it should not include the sleet or ice that created the current hazardous conditions.

University spokesman Adam McDonald said power provider Entergy Louisiana is hopeful it can restore power to 90% of the Interstate 20 corridor, which includes Monroe, by Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, temperatures are expected to remain below freezing into Tuesday. 
ULM students will be safe in their residence halls overnight, though the university has opened its activity center as a 24-hour warming center with cots, bathrooms and charging capability, McDonald said. 
“My entire leadership team is working around the clock with local and state partners and utilizing every resource available to us,” ULM President Carrie Castille wrote in a social media post. “Our priority is keeping our students safe, warm, and fed. I fully understand the discomfort and stress many of our students are experiencing, and I want to assure you that we are pushing for solutions on every front.” 
Classes at UL Monroe will remain cancelled at least until next Monday, McDonald said.
While ULM residence halls have water, the city of Monroe is experiencing low water pressure as the hard freeze has created leaks in its delivery system. 
Other universities in North Louisiana have not been as negatively impacted by the storm. Louisiana Tech, Grambling, LSU Shreveport and Northwestern State University have power, university officials said in separate interviews. 
But even with power, classes at Grambling, Northwestern State, LSU Shreveport, Southern University Shreveport and Centenary College are cancelled Tuesday, according to their websites. The Louisiana Tech campus will also be closed Wednesday.
LSU Shreveport spokeswoman Erin Smith said some students on campus lost power for a few hours Sunday, but it has since been restored. Some student apartments have also had hot water issues, though affected students are able to access hot water in other locations, Smith said. 
Louisiana Tech spokeswoman Cami Geisman said icy streets have made it difficult for some essential campus workers to make it to their posts, but campus police have been driving food service workers to work to ensure students are fed.

ULM students will be safe in their residence halls overnight, though the university has opened its activity center as a 24-hour warming center with cots, bathrooms and charging capability, McDonald said. 
“My entire leadership team is working around the clock with local and state partners and utilizing every resource available to us,” ULM President Carrie Castille wrote in a social media post. “Our priority is keeping our students safe, warm, and fed. I fully understand the discomfort and stress many of our students are experiencing, and I want to assure you that we are pushing for solutions on every front.” 
Classes at UL Monroe will remain cancelled at least until next Monday, McDonald said.
While ULM residence halls have water, the city of Monroe is experiencing low water pressure as the hard freeze has created leaks in its delivery system. 
Other universities in North Louisiana have not been as negatively impacted by the storm. Louisiana Tech, Grambling, LSU Shreveport and Northwestern State University have power, university officials said in separate interviews. 
But even with power, classes at Grambling, Northwestern State, LSU Shreveport, Southern University Shreveport and Centenary College are cancelled Tuesday, according to their websites. The Louisiana Tech campus will also be closed Wednesday.
LSU Shreveport spokeswoman Erin Smith said some students on campus lost power for a few hours Sunday, but it has since been restored. Some student apartments have also had hot water issues, though affected students are able to access hot water in other locations, Smith said. 
Louisiana Tech spokeswoman Cami Geisman said icy streets have made it difficult for some essential campus workers to make it to their posts, but campus police have been driving food service workers to work to ensure students are fed.

Larry Rhoden listens to a question at his first press conference of the 2026 legislative session on Jan. 15, 2026, at the South Dakota Capitol in Pierre. (Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — The South Dakota governor should retain exclusive control over a pot of economic development money known as the Future Fund, a committee of lawmakers decided Monday at the Capitol. 
The Senate State Affairs Committee rejected a bill that would have subjected the fund to greater oversight, after an earlier tie vote left the measure in limbo.
The committee voted 4-4 earlier this month on a motion to send the bill to the full Senate, with Sen. Arch Beal, R-Sioux Falls, excused due to illness. On Monday, with Sen. Curt Voight, R-Rapid City, replacing Beal on the committee, the proposal was defeated 5-4.
The bill would have required Future Fund awards to be approved by a majority vote of the governor-appointed Board of Economic Development, instead of the governor alone. It also would have directed the Governor’s Office of Economic Development to write rules establishing an application process, methods of assessing economic impact, selection criteria, qualification requirements and procedures for disbursing awards.
Governor pledges transparency in funding decisions that lawmakers might vote to take away

The Future Fund receives money from a fee paid by employers. It has drawn scrutiny in recent years over uses by former Gov. Kristi Noem, including millions in spending for a shooting range that lawmakers declined to fund, a rodeo and an advertising campaign starring Noem. 
Some of the bill’s opponents said a few examples do not undermine the value of a governor-controlled fund, which is intended to give the governor flexibility to quickly respond to economic opportunities. 
“This is funded by the employers. Not every taxpayer in the state funds this,” said Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish. “And those groups that represent employers are soundly opposed to this.” 
Groups opposing the bill included the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the South Dakota Retailers Association. 
Earlier this month, Gov. Larry Rhoden attempted to get ahead of the issue with an executive order laying out procedures for how Future Fund awards are handled. It self-imposes requirements for public posting of awards and agreements, while still preserving the governor’s sole authority over the fund. The order is not binding on future governors if they choose to operate the fund differently.
Meanwhile, another bill would increase the Governor’s Office of Economic Development’s reporting requirements for the Future Fund. That bill, from Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, has not yet had a hearing.
The economic development office is already required to report minimal information about the Future Fund twice per year to the Legislature’s budget committee. Muckey’s bill would require additional information to be included in the reports, such as all awards made in the prior 20 years, the fund balance at the time of the report, and the status of the research or economic development purpose of the awards. The report would also add a list of other legislative committees required to receive the reports once per year.

Colorado law currently restricts law enforcement from helping with federal immigration enforcement. Officers cannot keep someone in custody based on an ICE detainer request or arrest someone suspected of being in the country illegally at a courthouse. 
Local government officials and employees are also prohibited from sharing personal identifying information about immigration status with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which operates under DHS. Public officials who intentionally violate that data sharing provision are liable for a $50,000 civil fine, which goes to the state’s immigration legal defense fund.
As a constitutional amendment, the measure would need 55% of the vote to pass.
Advance Colorado, a conservative nonprofit advocacy group that does not disclose its donors, is behind the measure. The group led another ballot measure on the 2026 ballot that would mandate harsher penalties for possession of fentanyl.
U.S. Customs and Border patrol agents this week in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, just two weeks after ICE agents shot and killed Renee Good in that city. The two killings have sparked nationwide outrage, even as President Donald Trump’s top advisers have rushed to spread false information about Pretti and Good, both of whom were smeared as “domestic terrorists” by the administration within hours of being killed.
The election is Nov. 3.

(Photo by Jim Obradovich for Iowa Capital Dispatch)With less than six months until the 2026 primaries, three candidates announced Monday they are ending their campaigns for Iowa U.S. House seats.
In Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, state Rep. Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, suspended her campaign and endorsed Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, to become the Democratic nominee for the seat currently held by GOP Rep. Zach Nunn.
Konfrst said in a statement Monday she decided to run for Congress in January 2025 in order to “bring balance back to DC and bring my working class Iowa roots to the job.”
“I’m a sixth generation Iowan and I’ve spent most of my life in Iowa,” Konfrst said. “I love this state, even when it has disappointed me in recent years. I want Iowa to be a kinder place to live and raise a family. I want it to be a place where working class Iowans aren’t crushed by costs and struggling to get by. I want it to be a place where young Iowans, like my own kids and my students, can build a future for themselves. That’s still my goal and I’m ready to explore ways to do that.”
While Federal Election Commission fundraising reports are not due for federal candidates until Jan. 31, Konfrst fell behind Trone Garriott in October and July fundraising reports. The Democratic candidate thanked her campaign’s supporters who donated to her campaign, as well as the elected officials and community leaders who endorsed her in the race.
“I’m deeply proud of the campaign we’ve run, and I’m looking forward to serving in the Iowa legislature and working for my constituents,” Konfrst said.
Konfrst, formerly Iowa House minority leader, has not said whether she plans to seek another term at the Statehouse. She said her focus heading into 2026 was on electing Democrats in the 2026 elections, calling for mobilization against Iowa Republicans like Nunn who have supported President Donald Trump’s agenda.
“President Trump, enabled by Republican Congressman Zach Nunn, has unleashed an armed mob on American citizens, increased prices for groceries and utilities and engaged in unprecedented levels of corruption,” Konfrst said. “We must elect Democrats to the House and Senate in November to stop the chaos, fear and economic destruction – and this work begins in Iowa. I will be in this fight with you to elect Democrats, here at home in Polk County and across the whole state of Iowa.”
Trone Garriott thanked Konfrst for her leadership and the endorsement of her campaign.
“In a time when politics can feel loud and chaotic, Jennifer has stayed focused on what matters: protecting our public schools, doing right by Iowans, and standing up for our values. Our party is stronger because of her, and I’m thankful for her service,” Trone Garriot said. “… I’m ready to work alongside her to unify Democrats, earn the trust of voters across IA-03, and defeat Zach Nunn so we can lower costs and restore balance and accountability in Washington.”
In Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, Democrat Taylor Wettach also suspended his congressional campaign Monday, saying he will instead run for state auditor.
Wettach, a lawyer from Muscatine, announced his campaign in July for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks. In a campaign ad announcing his run, Wettach spoke about resigning from his job at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, after the New York-based law firm agreed to provide free legal services to the Trump administration to avoid facing executive actions.
As he moved to the auditor’s race, Wettach said in a statement he wants to ensure the seat is held by someone who will serve as “an independent watchdog for the people, regardless of who is in power – not a lapdog for corrupt politicians.”
Currently, Democrat Rob Sand serves as Iowa auditor — currently the only Democrat to hold statewide elected office. Sand is running for Iowa governor in 2026. Wettach is currently the only Democrat running for the auditor’s seat, but there are two Republicans vying for their party nomination — Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer and Abigail Maas, an Iowa County supervisor.
Wettach said he believed the race should not be focused on partisan issues, and that he believes his experience as an attorney will allow him to provide “accountability” for Iowa taxpayers.
“When Iowans are tightening their belts, the last thing they should have to worry about is whether their tax dollars are being wasted or misused,” Wettach said in a statement. “Instead of making life better for Iowans, some politicians in Des Moines are rigging the system to protect themselves instead of protecting taxpayers. Corruption isn’t then an accident – it’s the predictable result of unchecked power – and that should alarm every Iowan, regardless of party.”
Wettach announced endorsements from prominent Democrats, including former Gov. Tom Vilsack, former Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller and Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart for his campaign for auditor.
Republican officials have pointed to Wettach and Konfrst’s announcements as signs that Iowa Democrats wanting to avoid primaries. Iowa’s 1st and 3rd congressional districts are expected to be extremely competitive races in the upcoming election, with political forecasters like the Cook Political Report rating both races as “toss-ups.”
With Konfrst exiting the 3rd District race, Trone Garriott is likely poised to become the party nominee in the race. In the 1st District, Democrat Christina Bohannan has led in 2025 campaign finance reports against both Democratic challengers and Miller-Meeks. Though Wettach left the race, Bohannan still faces a primary race against Travis Terrell, a patient access specialist at University of Iowa Health Care.
Iowa GOP spokesperson Jade Cichy said in a Monday statement the Iowa Democratic Party “is once again trying to decide primaries before voters ever have their say.”
“Today’s coordinated announcements make their priorities clear: protecting party favorites, not empowering Iowans,” Cichy said. “By attempting to anoint Christina Bohannan and Sarah Trone Garriott, party insiders are proving these candidates would serve as nothing more than mouthpieces for the Democrat establishment.”
One Republican candidate also suspended her campaign Monday — Iowa Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, who was running for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District.
Lundgren said in a Monday statement she made the decision alongside her family to seek another term in the Iowa Legislature instead of seeking federal office.
“The challenges facing Iowa families are urgent, and I believe my voice and experience are most needed in the Iowa Legislature right now,” Lundgren said. “From lowering taxes and supporting our farmers to protecting our communities and promoting opportunity, I’ve worked tirelessly to make Iowa a better place. I’m excited to keep that momentum going and intend to run for reelection to the Iowa House to continue this important work on behalf of the hardworking people of District 65.”
There are two other Republicans — Republican candidate Joe Mitchell, a former state legislator and the the founder of Run Gen Z, and state Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett — running for the seat currently held by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson. Hinson is running for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat in 2026, a decision she announced after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst said she will not seek another term.
There are still four Democrats running for the party nomination in the 2nd Congressional District: Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque; Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25; Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College, and Guy Morgan, a Democrat from Boone.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/voting-stations-june-2024-primary-dm-12-13-_-jim-obradovich.jpg,,,2026-01-26 19:56:33.654986

Faster evictions in a tight housing market will only deepen Vermont’s homelessness crisis.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Maryellen Griffin: Evictions cause homelessness. We can’t afford more.  .","This commentary is by Maryellen Griffin, a staff attorney with Vermont Legal Aid who lives in Danville.



The data confirms what common sense tells us: eviction is a leading cause of homelessness. Thousands of Vermonters are already homeless, including hundreds of children, and legislative proposals to speed up evictions will only make things worse.  
Landlords filed 1,818 eviction cases in Vermont in 2024. If we speed up the eviction process, where will these households go? 

READ MORE

With a rental vacancy rate of just 2.1% and only 1% in Chittenden County, there’s simply nowhere for people to land. Raising the number and speed of evictions will create more homelessness.  
Instead, the Legislature should focus on preventing eviction. Preventing eviction is far cheaper than homelessness. 
The evidence consistently shows that back-rent assistance and right-to-counsel programs save states money by preventing eviction, homelessness and the resulting costs to taxpayers. These aren’t theoretical solutions. They’re proven interventions. 
Elinor (not her real name), a Legal Aid client, has lived in her apartment for five years without incident. Two years ago, three investors bought her building. 
They raised her rent by 30%, and when she questioned the increase, they started eviction proceedings against her. 
Vermont has no legal limit on how much a landlord can raise rent or how quickly, and Elinor can be evicted for no reason at all, even if she pays the increase. She’s willing to move, but she does not have anywhere to go. Way too many tenants in this situation end up homeless. 
Elinor’s story isn’t unique. In the past five years, requests for legal help with eviction have increased by 45%. This is what happens when eviction meets a housing crisis. 
Between 2019 and 2024, Vermont’s rental vacancy rate dropped from 4.5% to 2.1%. During this same period, median gross rent jumped 34.6%, from $980 to $1,319. 
Over half of Vermont’s renter households already pay more than 30% of their income on rent, and, for one in four, housing costs are more than half their income. 
More than 70% of all evictions are for nonpayment of rent. These aren’t irresponsible tenants. They’re our neighbors, our service workers, families and retirees whose income stayed flat while rents rose 35% in five years. 
In recent years, the number of available rental units has actually decreased. Between population growth, short-term rentals, flood damage and other losses, Vermont just doesn’t have enough of the kind of housing people need. 
Given the severe shortage of affordable units and the extremely limited availability of deeply affordable housing, our high rates of homelessness are completely predictable. 
When you evict someone in a market with a tiny vacancy rate, you’re not helping them find better housing. You’re making them homeless.  
In a crisis where there’s nowhere for displaced tenants to go, making evictions faster just pushes families into homelessness, transferring costs to the public that are far higher than the original rent dispute. 
The costs of mass homelessness are staggering: emergency department visits, shelter costs, management of encampments and, tragically, lives lost.  
While emergency housing is expensive, kicking people out of emergency housing when they have nowhere else to go is not just cruel; it actually costs municipalities even more. 
Meanwhile, some legislators are proposing ways to evict people faster, even though investing in eviction prevention strategies would cost less and work better. 
These are our neighbors being evicted. This can happen to anyone in a market this tight. 
Vermont faces a clear choice. We can fund back-rent programs and require mediation before evictions are filed. We can ensure effective housing support services are available to everyone facing eviction and guarantee tenants the right to legal counsel—programs that cost less and work better than managing the homelessness that results from eviction. We can improve access to rental assistance. 
Or we can speed up evictions and watch our homelessness crisis accelerate, spending even more on emergency services and shelter and seeing even more Vermonters suffer. 
Where are people supposed to go when we evict them faster? Until we answer that question honestly and invest in real solutions, legislating for more and faster evictions isn’t a solution. It’s simply a way to push more Vermonters onto our streets. 
The evidence is clear, and the human cost of getting this wrong is too high to ignore.

SB 1326 would require Florida judges to sentence offenders found guilty who intended to commit their crimes to prison, even if the accused couldn’t tell whether their actions were right or wrong. It was inspired by fears that Florida could accidentally release violent, legally insane offenders onto the street.
But the bill had glaring loopholes: Its language could remove the option for offenders to receive court-mandated mental health treatment. An independent senator called the legislation “crap,” a Democrat deemed it “unjust,” and a Republican voted “no,” resulting in SB 1326 barely passing in a 4-to-3 vote.
However, Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin, the bill’s sponsor, acknowledged problems and promised changes. 
“This bill is something that is far from perfect,” he said in the Senate Criminal Justice committee. 
“At this point, it’s our first attempt to deal with the issue that comes up when somebody is guilty of a heinous act and, but for the fact that they’re being found not guilty legally for reasons of insanity, they would serve a very long prison sentence,” the Fort Myers Republican added.
Florida is one of 25 states that uses the prevailing “right-wrong test,” or “M’Naghten Rule.” The strictest of insanity defenses, defendants can only be declared legally insane if they’re unable to tell the difference between right and wrong. 
Twenty-six other states use looser versions of the defense, while just four states have outlawed it altogether. Florida hopes to follow that latter pattern.
Despite this, the insanity defense is used in fewer than 1% of cases nationwide, and is successful in just a quarter of those attempts. That means roughly 30 Americans every year are declared not guilty by reason of insanity.
Harsh criticism
The measure ran into serious problems during its Monday afternoon stop. 
This included that the language would prevent judges from issuing a lesser sentence than usual if circumstances warrant and fails to mandate mental health treatment for unwell offenders. 
“It’s crap the way it’s written right now,” said Sen. Jason Pizzo, a former prosecutor and the sole independent lawmaker in the Legislature. The Hollywood NPA emphasized that he doesn’t believe the Legislature should take “the pen out of” judges’ hands. 
“I know where you’re trying to get … but we have some judges that … I would trust to find the appropriate remedy,” he added. Despite this, Pizzo voted yes because he believes the insanity defense needs reform and if Martin’s bill dies Monday, so would the issue.
Democratic Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, representing Orlando, took a different approach. He called the idea of removing judges’ ability to make special changes “unjust,” and a “public safety risk,” deriding the idea of putting a violent offender in prison with no available treatment options.
“We know what our prisons are dealing with. They are bursting at the seams, they are overcrowded, they are understaffed,” Smith said. “And this bill forces more people with serious mental illnesses deeper into a prison system that’s already failing.”
Joining Smith in his “no” vote were Democratic Sen. Mack Bernard from West Palm Beach and Miami Republican Sen. Ileana Garcia.
Where did it come from?
SB 1326 is a priority bill for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier. In October, Uthmeier called for sweeping reforms to the state’s insanity defense, inspired by a 2015 case out of Kentucky.
Ronald Exantus stabbed a 6-year-old to death in Versailles, Kentucky. He was convicted of assault, but found not guilty by reason of insanity of murder. After serving less than half of his 20-year sentence, he was placed on mandatory supervised release.
Exantus moved to Florida, where he lived in Marion County near an elementary school and subsequently failed to register as a felon. So, Uthmeier in October led the charge to repatriate him to Kentucky.
“We cannot allow what happened in Kentucky to ever occur in Florida,” he said at the time.
Of note, Kentucky abides by a weaker version of the insanity defense than Florida, called the Model Penal Code. This allows defendants to be declared legally insane if they couldn’t tell right from wrong or could not control an impulse that led to the crime. 
Although 21 states use the MPC, it largely fell out of favor when the attempted Ronald Reagan assassin, John Hinckley Jr., was found not guilty by reason of insanity through it.
If Martin’s bill backed by the AG passes, it would replace the “right-wrong test,” with intent to commit a crime. This closely reflects a controversial, yet landmark, law out of Kansas. The Kansas law, fully eliminating the insanity defense, was battled up to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2020, where it was ultimately decided that states don’t have to adopt insanity defense laws.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1135138396-scaled-1-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 18:56:49.327235

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Days after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, New Mexico Democrats on Monday morning said they’ll continue to protect immigrants across the state. One representative called on the governor to demand an end to all U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.
Rep. Sarah Silva (D-Las Cruces) in a Sunday afternoon statement called on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to demand the federal government cease ICE operations and “de-escalate the situations we are seeing in Minnesota, New Mexico and other parts of the country.” In an interview with Source NM Monday, Silva said she was concerned that, without intervention, the Trump administration could similarly target New Mexico.
The U.S. Department of Justice in December sued New Mexico and five other states for allegedly failing to produce statewide voter registration lists. In Minnesota, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in a letter to Gov. Tim Walz said state leaders could end the influx of federal agents, in part, by turning over voter data to the federal government.
“I am very concerned that New Mexico has already been targeted by the president with his comments around our Secretary of State and our voter rolls,” Silva said. “That, paired with Attorney General Bondi’s insistence that if Minnesota turns over their voter rolls, ICE will back off. That tells me that there’s a pattern that could put New Mexico next on the list.”
Lujan Grisham in a statement Sunday said she was “horrified by the killing of U.S. citizens by ICE agents in Minneapolis in recent days” and backed a statement from the Democratic Governors Association that said “these dangerous and reckless actions must come to an end.” The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Silva expressed optimism, however, that criticisms of federal agents’ deadly use of force appear to be crossing party lines. She cited Chris Madel, a Minnesota attorney who on Monday posted a statement criticizing the wave of federal agents in Minneapolis and announced that he would no longer seek the state’s GOP nomination for governor.
As Silva left her office on the fourth floor of the Roundhouse, demonstrators gathered on the western steps of the Capitol building for Immigrant and Workers Day of Action. A bundled-up crowd waved pro-immigrant picket signs as the wind chill hovered in the high teens. New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) addressed the crowd with a promise to look out for immigrants in New Mexico, in part by passing House Bill 9, known as the Immigrant Safety Act, which would ban New Mexico counties and towns from signing onto immigration detention contracts.
“I will shout from the rooftops and demand that the federal government do the right thing. And I will also work like hell to make sure that every single policy passing is focused on…the rights of the least amongst us,” Martínez told Source NM.
He said he would happily back Silva’s call on the governor to act and said he hopes his constituents know that regarding the federal government’s immigration crackdowns, there is “no room in our state and there’s no room in this country for that type of hate.”
Nationally, some Republicans have called for an investigation into Pretti’s killing. In New Mexico, Senate Minority Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) in an interview with Source NM said that “having somebody killed for any reason is tragic,” and said he believes “any death,” including those involving law enforcement officers, ought to be investigated. However, he said he doesn’t think people would die while protesting ICE if it weren’t for “organized rallies to interfere with their operations.”
“Why are people at risk today? Because we’ve got elected officials that are telling people to go out there and interfere with law enforcement,” he said. “They have a right to protest, I’m not saying that. But when you go out of your way to create a mob, that’s what causes problems.”
State Fair transformation project returns to Legislature
Lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee on Monday morning had their first chance to weigh in on a massive State Fair grounds transformation project the Legislature set in motion last session.
The project has drawn widespread interest because it could move the New Mexico State Fair from its home of nearly 90 years and make way for proposed developments, including a new amphitheater, affordable housing and a public park. The potential benefits the investment could bring to the nearby International District, which has long been beleaguered by high rates of pedestrian deaths, crime and drug addiction, have also drawn particular interest.
Lawmakers this session will be asked to approve $92 million in bonds that will go toward acquiring property at the southeast end of the fairgrounds, as well as projects to improve pedestrian safety at two intersections. The legislation lawmakers approved last year empowers the board to issue up to $500 million in bonds for the transformation project. 
Republicans, including Sens. Steve Lanier of Aztec and Nicole Tobiassen of Albuquerque, urged presenters to bear in mind the cultural importance of the fair, particularly to rural farmers and kids in the 4-H program. 
Former Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez, who is spearheading the project on behalf of the governor, stressed that no decisions have been made thus far about the fair’s future.
“These are things we call ‘move-agnostic,’ Chavez said of the changes made possible through the bonds. “The issue of whether the fair goes or stays — a decision is not made. And that’s going to be a fun one for everybody involved.”
65 years in the making
In 1961 — while John F. Kennedy was being sworn in as president and the Beatles were playing their first show under that name at the Cavern Club in Liverpool — the State Legislature established the first University of New Mexico School of Medicine.
The Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee on Monday reviewed a measure, Senate Bill 6, to build a new UNM School of Medicine that would allow the school, which currently produces about 40% of the state’s practicing physicians, to double its enrollment. Lujan Grisham labeled that growth a priority in her State of the State address earlier in January.
Looking ahead
The House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee is scheduled on Tuesday afternoon to review four public safety bills, including House Bill 25. If enacted, HB25 would ban the sale or possession of a gun by an adult who was charged or sentenced for using a gun during a crime before they were 18, even if the person were not sentenced as an adult. Additionally, juvenile crime records involving firearms, which are typically sealed, would be available to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the instant background check database. 
Tuesday is Future Farmers of America Day at the Roundhouse.

Lawmakers tweaked provisions that would have increased class size and omitted positions like school counselors from the funding model. This came after hours of testimony, much in opposition.
The post After pushback, legislative committee scales back proposed cuts to public education appeared first on WyoFile .","Over two days last week, teachers, parents, administrators, lobbyists and others took turns explaining to state lawmakers the problems they see with Wyoming’s evolving plan to fund public education. 
Many who testified before the Select School Recalibration Committee in Cheyenne began by pointing out the positive — the bill would give teachers a salary bump. 
But — and there were a lot of buts — the bill draft also raised classroom sizes, eliminated hundreds of full-time teacher roles, cut millions in education funding and failed to address issues like school nutrition and mental health counseling mandated by a 2025 court order, critics said. 
“Teachers aren’t fooled,” Laramie County educator Jen McKee said Friday. “We see the hidden tradeoff buried in this plan … This proposal pretends to invest in education while quietly dismantling the structures that keep Wyoming schools functioning.”
The complaints did not go unnoticed. The lawmaking panel ultimately made several amendments to the legislation, modifying it to create smaller class sizes, adjusting the minimum number of teachers in small schools and inserting a placeholder for mental health, nurses, counselors and related-support funding.
Lawmakers will still wait until next summer to nail down the specifics for funding those areas, said Sen. Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, but the placeholder shows intention. 
“I think it’s wise that we put it in the bill draft to show as a placeholder, to show that we are serious about this,” Biteman said. 
He wasn’t the only lawmaker to emphasize the gravity of the job. The committee is tasked with the exhaustive and tedious work of assessing the state’s constitutionally mandated school funding model and making necessary updates. Recalibration, as it is known, is required every five years, and this time it is unfolding following a 2025 court decision that Wyoming was failing to properly fund its public schools. 
The committee, which has been chipping away at the process since early last summer, reconvened last week for a final time before the legislative session starts in February. Lawmakers, perhaps anticipating blowback, were quick to defend their work.

“We want everyone to know that we are working diligently on recalibration. It’s a tremendous undertaking,” Co-chair Scott Heiner, R-Green River, said, adding that the committee didn’t feel it could get through it all in the one-year timeframe. “We just don’t have a silver bullet to fix everything within one fell swoop, and it’s going to take time to hear all the testimony and do what’s best for our state and for the children of Wyoming.”
State-funded education 
The recalibration process is required every five years to ensure the Legislature fulfills its constitutional duty to “provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.” 
To do that, the state’s consultants, Picus, Odden and Associates, have been holding meetings with Wyoming educators, analyzing data and making recommendations over the course of many months.
Amid the minutiae and acronym-heavy language of education, several issues emerged early as topics of high interest for educators and lawmakers — including teacher pay, school resource officers, school nutrition programs and technology. Wyoming once offered stellar pay compared with neighboring states, educators, say, but that has slipped and with it districts’ ability to attract and retain high-quality teachers.
Many of those priorities overlap with areas identified in a February district court ruling that found the Wyoming Legislature violated the state’s constitution by underfunding public education and must amend that. The ruling, which the state is appealing, is the latest in a string of court cases that have further delineated the state’s education obligations.

In his 186-page order, Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher found the Legislature failed to properly fund the “basket of quality educational goods and services,” that the Wyoming Supreme Court in 1995 ordered lawmakers to set, update and fund every two years. 
The judge also found the state failed to properly adjust funding for inflation; failed to provide funding for adequate salaries for teachers and staff; and failed to provide sufficient funding for mental health counselors, school safety resource officers, nutritional programs and computers for students. Lawmakers also have failed to properly assess school buildings for “educational suitability,” and have allowed inadequate facilities to exist for too long without repair or replacement, he ruled.
In October, recalibration committee members advanced several recommendations for inclusion into the final bill. That included setting average weighted teacher salaries at roughly $70,000, a bump from the model’s current weighted average of under $60,000. It also, however, increased classroom sizes, mandated that districts use the state health insurance plan and tabled topics like mental health counselors for future study. 
Educators and others decried the latter decisions during the two days of testimony last week. 
Several district superintendents stressed the importance of Wyoming’s so-called “block grant model,” which gives districts flexibility on spending. 
“Some of these policies could inadvertently hurt all schools that rely on flexibility to meet essential needs,” Fremont County School District 2 Business Manager Amanda Ysen said. 
Administrators along with insurance industry representatives also came out strongly against a mandate to join the state’s health insurance plan, warning it would have negative consequences. There are good reasons that districts have not opted to join the plan in the past, said Sheridan County School District 1 Business Manager Jeremy Smith. The mandate represents “a massive government takeover of private industry,” he said. 
“Don’t waste anyone else’s time today testifying about how the state health insurance plan works, because it doesn’t work for us,” he said. “It won’t work for us, and that’s true for the other 47 districts who have not chosen it.”
Another major bone of contention was class sizes.

“In education, we know that the most important factor in a child’s learning is the teacher in the classroom, and that teacher’s ability to build relationships with students and spend time with students,” said Sheridan third-grade teacher and mother Megan Edmunds. “I’m deeply concerned about the proposed funding changes and the negative impact I feel they’ll have on student learning.”
Alex Petrino, a parent, counselor, Natrona County school board trustee and Wyoming Counseling Association member, warned lawmakers that mental health supports are essential in schools. 
“Educators, counselors and school teams are not asking for extras. They’re asking for basic capacity,” Petrino said. “And yet this committee is talking about taking away the very basic support that the students need where they spend most of their day. This is not recalibration, that’s destabilization.”
Taken together, Lincoln County School District 1 Superintendent Teresa Chaulk said, the bill’s proposals are harmful.  
“I respectfully urge the Legislature to align it with its stated priorities and to provide clear, transparent answers so that Wyoming students and teachers are not the unintended casualties of this recalibration process,” Chaulk said.
Bipartisan, unanimous
After hours of feedback last week, lawmakers began to propose changes aimed at quelling some of the public’s concerns. 
Sen. Wendy Schuler, R-Evanston, proposed an amendment to decrease the proposed fourth- through eighth-grade class size ratios from 25 students to one teacher down to 22:1, and kindergarten through third-grade from 16:1 to 15:1. That passed. 
“I think this will help the districts tremendously,” Schuler said. 
Rep. Mike Yin, a Teton County Democrat, proposed a complicated amendment that aimed to buffer his home district from negative impacts a regional cost adjustment would incur owing to Teton County’s unique economics. Rep. Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, proposed an amendment to increase minimum teachers for small schools. Rep. Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie, proposed limits on maximum school-population-reduction  amounts for schools. All passed.

Sheridan Republican Rep. Tom Kelly proposed striking the state health insurance plan mandate. 
“I have been a critic of fixing something I don’t think is broken, and in this case, I think the choice of health insurance is not a broken system,” Kelly said. 
Kelly’s motion was not seconded, meaning it didn’t have enough support for discussion or vote.  
Laramie Democrat Sen. Chris Rothfuss piggybacked on the topic by asking that the committee undergo more rigorous investigation into the insurance provision before pulling the trigger. His suggestion passed. 
The committee also tweaked provisions regarding investments and how often cost adjustments take place, and extended a state mental health grant by one year. 
Lawmakers unanimously advanced the recalibration bill, which Co-Chair Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, said wasn’t luck.
“We did a lot of work,” Salazar said. “There was a lot of give and take. There was compromise, and I so appreciate working on a bipartisan effort to have a unanimous vote.”
Not everyone was took such a rosy view. In a legislative update post on its website, the Wyoming Education Association, which filed the lawsuit that resulted in the 2025 court order, said the committee presented no substantial solutions to the concerns it heard.
“The big takeaway is that after days of testimony, with educators and advocates lined out the door to provide testimony, the committee offered no real fixes and instead dangled scraps from the table in an attempt to dissuade education professionals from standing up for themselves and their students,” the post read.
The bill still has a long way to go. The Wyoming Legislature convenes for its budget session on Feb. 9.

Both seem to be pushing slightly against their respective party lines.
Pretti, a Veterans Affairs nurse, was shot multiple times by immigration agents during a scuffle that erupted Saturday as he stepped between two women and an agent who was shoving them.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Pretti, who had a pistol holstered in his waistband, “attacked” officers and “brandished” his weapon. But video footage appears to contradict that accusation, and does not show Pretti ever holding the firearm. He had a permit to carry the pistol legally.

The shooting took place just over two weeks after another ICE officer shot and killed Minnesota resident Renee Good.
Republican Sen. Dave McCormick issued a statement on Sunday calling for a “full investigation” into the shooting that killed Pretti.
“As I have often said, I support the Border Patrol, ICE, and the critical work they do to enforce our laws. Irresponsible rhetoric and a lack of cooperation from Minnesota’s politicians are fueling a dangerous situation,” he wrote on the social media platform X. “I also agree with the [National Rifle Association] and others — we need a full investigation into the tragedy in Minneapolis. We need all the facts. We must enforce our laws in a way that protects the public while maintaining its trust. This gives our law enforcement officers the best chance to succeed in their difficult mission.”
The National Rifle Association, which has long supported primarily conservative politicians, objected to administration officials’ claim that Pretti was an innate danger for carrying a gun, and also called for a “full investigation” into the shooting.
McCormick did not respond to questions from the Pennsylvania Capital-Star about who should lead the investigation. 
Sen. John Fetterman, meanwhile, has been perhaps the staunchest supporter of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement agenda among congressional Democrats.
While many in his party, including Democratic House members from Pennsylvania, were quick to criticize the shooting, Fetterman remained silent — until Monday.
“The operation in Minneapolis should stand down and immediately end. It has become an ungovernable and dangerous urban theatre for civilians and law enforcement that is incompatible with the American spirit,” Fetterman said in a statement. “As a very pro-immigration Democrat and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border Management, I believe our nation deserves a secured border and that we should deport all criminal migrants. I also believe there needs to be a path to citizenship for those hardworking families who are here.”

Fetterman also rejected calls from members of his party to “abolish ICE” entirely. And he addressed a movement in his caucus to vote against a coming appropriations bill over DHS funding, a move that could lead to a partial government shutdown.
“I’ve also spent significant time hearing many different positions on the funding bills and maintain that I will never vote to shut our government down, especially our Defense Department,” Fetterman’s statement said. “A vote to shut our government down will not defund ICE. DHS has $178B in funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which I did not vote for.”
Fetterman’s comments followed shortly after his wife, Gisele Fetterman, issued a statement of her own. 
“For more than a decade, I lived undocumented in the US,” she wrote in her first post on the social media platform X in almost a year. “Every day carried the same uncertainty and fear lived in my body – a tight chest, shallow breaths, racing heart. What I thought was my private, chronic dread has now become a shared national wound. This now-daily violence is not “law and order.” It is terror inflicted on people who contribute, love and build their lives here. It’s devastatingly cruel and unAmerican.”
Pennsylvania’s Democratic U.S.House members have largely taken a harder tack. Even before Pretti was killed, all seven Democratic representatives voted against a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Those who spoke about their decisions cited concerns about a lack of oversight and accountability for the agency’s immigration enforcement officers. The bill passed the Republican-led chamber regardless.

Six of the Democrats — all but Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-06) — have co-sponsored articles of impeachment filed for Noem. Without Republican support, it’s unlikely to result in impeachment in the House or conviction in the Senate.
All ten of Pennsylvania’s Republican House members voted in favor of funding for DHS. A number have publicly supported ICE as well, even after the killing of Good in Minneapolis.
Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a Republican who represents a swing district, has issued a statement calling for “a full and fair investigation” into Pretti’s shooting.
“Moving forward, oversight and cooperation need to be emphasized,” he wrote on X. But,  Mackenzie did not lay the blame squarely on ICE. He also noted, “officials in Minneapolis and even here in our own community have fanned the flames of division and disrespect for law enforcement.”
As it stands, the Department of Homeland Security has said they are conducting their own investigation, which has raised concerns of a possible coverup among local elected leaders and investigators, as well as Democrats.
According to state officials, law enforcement were blocked from the scene when initially responding to the shooting, even after obtaining a warrant. The Hennepin County Attorney’s office and Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension have filed a lawsuit to prevent the destruction of evidence. It claims witnesses were arrested by federal agents and cell phones that may have been used to record the shooting were seized.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alexpretti-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 18:56:49.327235

The report from Doug Hoffer’s office describes a lack of systems for tracking energy reductions and two projects that cost the state hundreds of thousands more than they save.

Vermont is failing to meet and monitor its own longstanding goals to formally reduce the amount of energy the state consumes — laws and systems aimed both at reducing cost and impact on the environment — according to a recent report from the State Auditor’s Office.
At the center of auditor Doug Hoffer’s report are the shortcomings of two initiatives: the State Agency Energy Plan, which is an evolving document providing guidance since 1992 for state agencies to reduce energy consumption in government work, and the State Energy Management Program, which is run by the Department of Buildings and General Services to implement these energy efficiency projects in state buildings.
The Department of Buildings and General Services has not been measuring the state’s progress in meeting the goals outlined by the State Agency Energy Plan, despite its requirement to report on it every two years, as the auditor’s report outlined.  
It has no system to quantify how much transportation fuel state employees use and how much energy the state uses in the buildings it leases, and no established way to capture all the energy used across state buildings, Hoffer’s report cites.
Moreover, the auditor’s report found two instances where the BGS energy office actually lost money, rather than achieving energy efficiency savings with its project.
One lighting project the auditor cited at the Barre Courthouse cost $143,170 more than it is expected to save over the course of its lifetime, according to estimates by Efficiency Vermont, an organization that contracts with the state and aims to reduce energy use and cost — though the department’s internal estimates reported it would cost $72,749 more than it saved. 
A second lighting project, at the government office building at 133 State St. in Montpelier, will cost $550,687 more than its expected lifetime savings, the auditor’s report found, again highlighting a difference in its calculations and the department’s. The department originally stated the project would save more than $303,000 because it was partially paid for with funds from outside the State Energy Management Program. 
It’s part of a broader trend the auditor describes of miscalculation at the department. The Auditor’s Office compared Efficiency Vermont’s estimates of lifetime savings for 13 projects and found that the Department of Buildings and General Services overestimated savings by more than $1,666,500.

Moreover, the program may be leaving money on the table by not seeking out as many cost-saving projects as it historically has, the auditor report claims. Normally the program completes around five projects a year, the report cites, but over the last three fiscal years, that number has been only one or two a year. 
It’s likely due to staffing shortages, the auditor wrote. One or both of the energy project manager positions have been vacant since 2021, he noted. It’s likely not due to any shortage in potential projects, of which the program has identified more than 50, through energy audits from 2016 through 2024. Of those, the department only completed 15. 
The auditor concluded with a series of recommendations to address these shortfalls, including that the department adhere to the reporting requirements and develop a system for tracking energy use. Hoffer’s report also calls for the department to scale up the number of projects it does and for more coordination with Efficiency Vermont. 
Wanda Minoli, the commissioner of the Department of Buildings and General Services, responded to Hoffer’s findings in a letter added to the report. Minoli agreed with nearly all of Hoffer’s findings and offered a timeline for the department to implement the recommendations the report outlines.

Monday’s email from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services did not specify why the plan was canceled or whether it will be rescheduled, an employee said.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has reportedly canceled its plan to send some of its Vermont workers to Minnesota — for now.
According to an employee who works for the federal agency in one of its Vermont offices, USCIS notified workers by email Monday that its plan to temporarily deploy a few employees to Minnesota to assist the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, is canceled.
Last week, at least seven USCIS employees based in Vermont were tapped to be reassigned to Minnesota this month, according to an employee who spoke to VTDigger on the condition they not be named due to fear of retaliation.

Monday’s email from USCIS did not specify why the plan was canceled or whether it will be rescheduled, the employee said. The person was not one of those chosen for the temporary relocation.
A federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security that processes visa, asylum, citizenship and other immigration-related applications, USCIS has several offices across Vermont, including in Barre and Essex Junction. It does not typically engage in the kind of immigration enforcement ICE conducts.
The decision to send workers who mostly process paperwork to support ICE activity in Minneapolis would be “dangerous,” the employee said last week.
U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., who was “outraged” last week and demanded answers from the Department of Homeland Security for sending Vermont workers to assist ICE in another state, welcomed the recent change.
“Given the aggressive ICE operations underway in Minnesota which have already led to deadly force and widespread fear, I raised serious concerns about sending Vermont USCIS employees into roles far outside their mission and training,” she said in a Monday press release. “I’m relieved those reassignments are no longer moving forward, and that these public servants can remain focused on helping people navigate the immigration system safely and lawfully.”
Escalating enforcement in the northern state of Minnesota, which borders Canada, has become the department’s largest immigration operation to date, according to Homeland Security.
Continued violence and heightened tensions in Minnesota have sparked anti-ICE protests across the nation and in Vermont since federal immigration agents in Minneapolis fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on Jan. 7 and then 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday.
Republican Gov. Phil Scott has since condemned the violence of federal immigration agents and called on President Donald Trump to change course in Minnesota.
Senators Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Peter Welch, D-Vt, both condemned ICE’s aggressive immigration tactics there.
“ICE is out of control, ignoring the law and our Constitution,” Sanders said in a press release Monday urging Congress to vote against additional funding for Homeland Security. 
Welch called for the “dire need for accountability” on the shootings of civilians in Minneapolis on MS NOW.
“When I talked to law enforcement officers here in Vermont, this is not policing that they at all respect. There has to be an investigation [into] the tactics of ICE,” he said, according to a press release Monday.
Meanwhile, more than a dozen clergy from across Vermont traveled to Minnesota last week to stand in solidarity with faith leaders against the violence, according to a Monday press release from Vermont Interfaith Action, a grassroots community organizing network.

Trey Gregory, a political neophyte, is originally from Atlanta, Georgia and attended Texas Christian University. He has worked with hedge funds, in medical sales, and as a entrepreneur and consultant according to his campaign website.
He is running “not as a career politician, but as an outsider ready to be the authentic voice for all Montanans,” according to his campaign.
Republican Trey Gregory is campaigning to unseat incumbent Sen. Steve Daines.
In an email to the Daily Montanan, Gregory said he’s challenging Daines because he believes the incumbent has fallen short in delivering “tangible outcomes for everyday Montanans.”
“Healthcare is still a disaster – especially for seniors living on fixed incomes and for younger Montanans who don’t have the luxury of staying on a parent’s health plan,” Gregory wrote. “We talk about reform every election cycle, but people are still struggling to afford care, prescriptions, and coverage. That’s unacceptable.”
He also said that Montana’s land and natural resources are not being utilized to the fullest extent, saying that he believes there is work that can be done to forge “mutually beneficial partnerships” with the state’s Tribal Nations to responsibly increase resource development.
A pillar of Gregory’s campaign is a plan to entirely fund his efforts to unseat a sitting senator, which he says he has received criticism for, but he believes it’s what Montanans want to see.
“Find me one person who dislikes the fact that they don’t have to cough up funds to support the right person for the job,” Gregory wrote. “I am not fundraising for this campaign. I don’t believe Montanans should have to pay for representation or open their wallets just to support someone running for office.”
“I’m not taking anyone’s money, therefore I’m not beholden to anyone. That independence is intentional,” he said, adding that Daines has previously had “campaign finance controversies.”
Montana’s primary election will be held on June 2.

(Photo by Karsan Turner for Iowa Capital Dispatch) Young hunters could skip the in-person elements currently required by Iowa’s hunter safety program under a bill that advanced from a House subcommittee Monday. 
Currently, Iowa hunter education for those under the age of 17 requires either in-person classes or a combination of an approved online program, plus an in-person field day. 
House File 2020 was filed by Rep. Jason Gearhart, R-Strawberry Point, who explained that the in-person requirements were difficult to attend for some families — like his own — who live in more rural areas and have limited opportunities to attend.

Gearhart said to get around this, his children took an approved hunter safety course from the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, which does not have a field day requirement, but is accepted in Iowa through reciprocity. 
“So we accept it from other states, I just feel like we should offer the same and make the field day optional,” Gearhart said. 
The bill adds language that a hunter over the age of 11 may obtain a hunter safety certification from a “nationally recognized organization, including the national rifle association.” 
HF 2020 also said the requirement could be satisfied by an online course either offered or approved by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. 
Tammie Krausman, DNR’s communications director, said the language pointing to “recognized organizations” could affect Iowa’s reciprocity with other states since certifications are issued by a government entity. 
Krausman said the field days are a time for hunters to learn about handling firearms, Iowa-specific laws and how to interact with landowners. 
“We want to make sure we have really good hunters out there with good ethics,” Krausman said. 
The department was not registered for or against the bill. 
Gearhart said the field days should be optional for hunters who have someone to show them how to shoot and be responsible hunters.
“I feel it’s more important for a parent, mentor or grandparent, someone to take that child out, teach them how to hunt versus one day at a field day,” Gearhart said.

The office also includes the Billings Office of the Custer-Gallatin National Forest (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montana)A series of public opinion polls show strong opposition from western voters to President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Bureau of Land Management. 
According to the poll conducted by RABA Research and released by the Montana Wildlife Fund, 75% of voters in Montana oppose the nomination of Steve Pearce. 
Identical surveys conducted in Idaho and New Mexico showed similar results.
Pearce has been a polarizing pick to lead the nation’s largest federal land management agency, with opponents pointing to his record advocating for selling off federal lands, while mining and energy companies have enthusiastically supported his nomination. 
A former Congressman from New Mexico, Pearce sponsored legislation in Congress that would authorize land sales or exchanges with local governments, and he once wrote that the federal government does “not even need” most of the public land in the west. 
He also has strong industry ties as the former owner of an oilfield services company who still holds strong business connections. 
But there has been a concerted effort by outdoor-focused lobbying groups to draw a hard line on public land sales — a flashpoint in Congress last year — including funding polls to illustrate a dearth of public support for Pearce’s nomination. 
The Montana poll, which was conducted via online interviews with 503 voters from Jan. 16-18, found that 97% of respondents said public lands were important to the state and community, and that 84% said public lands should be “protected and kept in public hands.”
Nine in 10 respondents said they have concerns Pearce’s confirmation could dramatically change how Montanans use BLM land. 
Among the respondents, 40% self-identified as Republicans, while 27% self-identified as Democrats. 
Asked specifically about the state’s current U.S. Senators, who must vote to confirm the nominee to lead the BLM, 62% of respondents said they would have a more favorable opinion of their elected officials if they voted against Pearce. The poll had a calculated margin of error of around 4.4%. 
Frank Szollosi, director of the Montana Wildlife Fund which released the poll, said the results demonstrate Montanans’ desire to preserve their public lands and offer the state’s senators a “clear choice” about standing with the majority of Montanans. 
“You don’t keep public lands in public hands by putting someone in charge who wants to sell them off,” Szollosi said in a statement. “Steve Pearce has treated public lands like disposable real estate. Montana’s BLM lands provide world-class hunting for elk, deer, antelope, and upland birds. These places protect important wildlife habitat and should not be sold to the highest bidder.”
Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy are both members of the newly-formed Senate Stewardship Caucus, a bipartisan coalition focused on public land access, land management policies and rural communities.
The two senators bucked their party in a vote last summer which blocked a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill that would have included public land sales.
However, Daines is the only member of Montana’s congressional delegation who has issued a comment on Pearce’s nomination, which is awaiting approval by the Senate. 
“I knew Steve in the House days, and Steve is a great pick. And I particularly like the fact that it’s a Westerner,” Daines said in an interview. “I think it’s helpful when we have leaders in those important positions that come from the West, when they understand uniquely the challenges we face as it relates to federal land, state land, private land. And Steve Pearce has lived it and breathed it.”
Sheehy has not publicly stated whether he will support Pearce. 
In Montana and the two Dakotas, the BLM manages more than 8.3 million acres of federal land. Nationwide, the BLM oversees 245 million acres of federal land, along with 700 million acres of subsurface rights for extraction and energy development, putting the position directly in the crosshairs of energy developers and outdoor industry groups. 
Opponents to Pearce’s nomination have also held up his relationships with oil and gas companies as problematic. In a letter to the Senate Energy and National Resources Committee, dozens of environmental and conservation organizations pointed to his former ownership of an oilfield services company and extensive stock holdings in oil-related companies, as well as the more than $2 million he received in political donations from the industry as reasons he “has not merited the honor of stewarding” public lands. 
The RABA survey found that 80% of Montana voters said Pearce’s connections to the oil and gas industry is inappropriate. 
Identical surveys conducted in Idaho and New Mexico showed 76% and 71% of voters, respectively, oppose Peace’s nomination, and 69% and 60% of respondents saying they’d view their senators more favorably for opposing Pearce.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BLM-office-I-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 18:56:49.327235

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Snowed in — unless you’re skiing: Vermont schools close as slopes fill up.","Winter storms blanketed Vermont with snow over the weekend and Monday, forcing schools to close, impacting road conditions and driving the masses to ski slopes. 
At least 8 inches of snow accumulation was reported across that state, with some locations reporting close to 15 inches over the course of the storm, according to the National Weather Services. 
Snow from the storm was lighter and more powdery because of the low moisture content, according to Adrianna Kremer, a meteorologist in the Burlington office of the weather service. Lighter snow poses less of a hazard to trees and power infrastructure, she added.
The weather service forecasted that additional snow storms would add 2 to 4 inches to the standing snow across most of the state by the end of Monday. Kremer did not expect much more snow in the coming week after Monday.  
Roads were still being cleared on Monday afternoon, according to the Vermont Agency of Transportation’s plow finder map. Few road closures or delays were reported on New England 511’s road conditions map as of Monday afternoon. 
Over the past weekend, school districts throughout the state preemptively announced closures.  
“Today was one of the best days for skiing and riding all year,” said Matt McCawley, a spokesperson for Smugglers’ Notch Resort, in an email. “Conditions right now are like Mary Poppins, practically perfect in every way.” 

McCawley said local ski pass holders came out in force after a foot of fresh powder covered the resort. Families took advantage of the school closures, he said, to get an extra day of skiing in. 
Killington Resort reported similar turnout as the storm dumped 14 inches of snow on the resort’s slopes by Monday morning, with an additional snow accumulation bringing its total to 17 inches by Monday afternoon. 
“Killington and Pico are seeing the best conditions of the season,” said Amy Laramie, a spokesperson for Killington Resort.
“Monday, the place was jumping,” McCawley said. “The joyous hoots and hollers coming from the woods over the silence this morning was amazing.”

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
As with tens of thousands of fellow Mississippians since a winter storm struck during the weekend, the Hood family of Oxford was coping with the loss of electricity as best they could early Monday in their Northpointe neighborhood home about 2 miles north of Square.
Tucker and Leanna Hood, husband and wife and both lawyers, and their two young daughters were all bundled up and “camping in” around the gas fire logs in the living room. Mary Ann Hood, Tucker’s mom who was visiting from Brandon, was also sleeping under several blankets. They were all fairly cozy, until the home’s carbon monoxide alarm, which had converted from electric power to battery-operated, went off at 5:30 a.m.
Reynolds Hood, 2, stayed warm in the car.
“It woke me up, and I immediately turned off the gas logs,” Tucker Hood said.
The temperature was 7 degrees outside and it was going to get really cold, really fast inside the house. The Hoods’ oldest daughter, Reynolds, is 2. The youngest, Ida Orley, turned 5 months old Monday. The roads were covered in ice and snow.
What to do?
“We decided to go for the cars,” Tucker said. “Seemed like the best option.”
One problem: The car doors and locks were frozen. Using heated water from a gas stove, the Hoods were able to get in the family van and crank it up, along with Mary Ann Hood’s small SUV.
In the vehicles, they had all they needed, except space.
Mary Ann Hood posted on Facebook: ”I am sitting on my lovely heated seat and the warm air is blasting away. I am charging my phone while listening to channel 28 on SirrusXM or sometimes to my favorite playlist… I have three excellent books to choose from and just had a delicious breakfast of belVita Crunchy biscuits. I have on my best Patagonia long underwear, flannel PJ’s, puffy jacket and two pair of Ugg socks in my cozy Ugg boots (thanks to whoever gave me these wonderful socks for Christmas). …Thank goodness, I have a full tank of gas.”
Tucker, LeAnna and the kids were parked a few feet away in the family van. Reynolds, the 2-year-old, was watching a movie in the backseat.
And that’s where they spent the next five hours until a family friend arrived with a generator to use in the house. File this all under: All’s well that ends well.
Said Tucker Hood, “I’m just glad that carbon monoxide alarm worked.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26161621/Reynolds-Hood-outside.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 18:56:49.327235

Mark Kelly’s lawyers say Pentagon attempting to violate his constitutional rights,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-sen-mark-kellys-lawyers-say-pentagon-attempting-violate-his-constitutional-rights,,"WASHINGTON — Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly’s lawyers on Monday urged a federal judge to block the Defense Department from downgrading his retirement rank as a Navy captain and his pay for telling U.S. troops they aren’t required to follow illegal orders. Paul J. Fishman wrote in a 35-page filing that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempt to punish Kelly for appearing in the video alongside other members of Congress violates several constitutional rights.  “As a decorated combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Kelly is deeply committed to the necessity of good order and discipline in the armed forces,” Fishman wrote. “He asks this Court to reinforce, not degrade, those principles. “His speech—simply reminding servicemembers of their fundamental obligation not to follow unlawful orders— promotes good order. And discipline does not demand silence —particularly from those no longer serving on active duty.”Fishman firmly rejected the Department of Justice’s assertion in a brief filed last week that the federal court system has no authority over the Defense Department’s actions in this instance. “Defendants begin from the premise that questions of ‘military discipline’ lie beyond judicial review,” Fishman wrote. “Their claim that this Court is ‘not permitted to address’ Senator Kelly’s challenge disregards reams of precedent reviewing military disciplinary actions and demands an untenable level of deference.”Senior Judge Richard J. Leon, who was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush, had scheduled a hearing on the issue for Wednesday, but postponed that until Feb. 3 due to the snowstorm. Hegseth pursues penaltiesDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced earlier this month that he had started the process to downgrade Kelly’s retirement rank and pay, writing in a social media post that his “status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.”The Defense Department letter of censure to Kelly alleged that his participation in the video undermined the military chain of command, counseled disobedience, created confusion about duty, brought discredit upon the Armed Forces and included conduct unbecoming of an officer. The video at the center of the debate featured Kelly, Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, Pennsylvania Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and New Hampshire Rep. Maggie Goodlander, all Democrats with backgrounds in the military or intelligence community.They said that Americans in those institutions “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” they said. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”Kelly lawyer’s argumentsFishman wrote in his brief that the Trump administration is asking the court to “embrace a novel rule” regarding the First Amendment: “that retired military veterans have no constitutional protection for their speech whenever the Secretary of Defense—in his sole discretion and without even identifying all of the speech at issue—concludes that it ‘risks undermining military discipline and good order.’” The Justice Department's brief from last week, he wrote, erroneously argued that retired military officers can legally face punishment for speaking out against Defense Department policies they oppose.“From Alexander Hamilton denouncing President Adams’s fitness to command during the Quasi-War, to modern episodes in which retired generals publicly called for Secretary Rumsfeld’s resignation over the Iraq War, retired officers have long participated forcefully in public debate over military policy,” Fishman wrote. “The same is true today: retired servicemembers, including Members of Congress, have openly criticized presidential decisions ranging from the Afghanistan withdrawal to vaccination requirements,” he added. “Many continue to serve with distinction as legislators, governors, and federal judges. Yet against that backdrop, Defendants assert the power to limit the First Amendment rights of more than two million retired servicemembers, all without judicial review.”",,,,2026-01-26 18:56:49.327235

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities appeared before a federal judge Monday and asked the court to stop the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement surge, arguing the chaos of recent weeks and the administration’s threats are unconstitutional.
Minnesota, Minneapolis and St. Paul on Jan. 12 sued the Trump administration, alleging that the influx of federal agents under the Trump administration’s “Operation Metro Surge” harms Minnesota’s police powers and violates state sovereignty. These rights are guaranteed under the 10th Amendment.
U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, heard arguments from both the state and federal government Monday but didn’t issue a ruling. Menendez asked skeptical questions of both sides, and though she said the case was “extremely important,” she didn’t issue a ruling Monday.
The state submitted voluminous filings to bolster their case, documenting widespread use of racial profiling, arbitrary arrests and warrantless searches of private residences.
The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota has led to three shootings by immigration officers in three weeks, with two ending in death.
But most of the hearing was dedicated to abstract legal arguments, in particular the claim from the plaintiffs that the federal operation is violating the state’s sovereign rights under the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Brian Carter, an attorney for the state, said the government is using Operation Metro Surge to “coerce” the state into acceding to its policy goals. Under the 10th Amendment’s anti-commandeering doctrine, the federal government cannot coerce states to enforce federal laws.
As evidence, Carter pointed to a letter U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Gov. Tim Walz in the wake of the killing of Minneapolis resident Alex Pretti by federal agents on Saturday. In that letter, Bondi suggested the Administration would scale back its immigration enforcement if Walz would release the state’s unredacted voter rolls, scrap all “sanctuary policies” designed to protect immigrants and share the state’s records of Medicaid and supplemental food assistance.
Carter referred to the missive as a “shakedown letter, a ransom note,” likening it to a threat from a mobster to burn down a restaurant. As further evidence of improper motive, he pointed to a tweet from President Donald Trump in which he stated that Minnesota’s “day of retribution” was coming.
Brian Carter argued that the Trump administration’s actions are “outrageously unlawful.”
“In the 250 years of this nation’s, of this republic’s history, we have never seen a federal government attack states based on personal animosity,” Carter said.
Menendez noted that the U.S. Constitution, federal law and “an awful lot of history support significant federal power around immigration.”
Brantley Mayers, an attorney with the Department of Justice’s Civil Division, urged Menendez to reject the state’s 10th Amendment arguments which, he said, “turns federalism on its head.” He did not rebut any of the factual claims made by the plaintiffs.
Mayers said Minnesota’s request to end Operation Metro Surge was “staggering.”
Mayers argued the Trump administration’s goal was to enforce federal immigration law. Because of Minneapolis’ so-called “sanctuary” policies, more federal agents are needed in the Twin Cities to enforce federal law.
Menendez appeared skeptical of this argument, noting that Chicago also has sanctuary policies. The federal government sent 400 immigration agents there, compared to Minnesota’s 3,000 plus, she said. She grilled the federal government’s attorney on whether Operation Metro Surge was really just about immigration enforcement or whether coercion was a factor.
“Is the executive trying to achieve a goal through force that it cannot achieve through the courts?” Menendez asked Mayers.
Mayers said no. “There’s nothing to back up this claim that we are here for another reason,” he said.
After the hearing, Attorney General Keith Ellison expressed optimism that the state would prevail.
“Once they decided it was retribution, they crossed a line,” Ellison said, referring to Trump’s tweet and Bondi’s demand letter. “At the end of the day, this is coercion and federal overreach.”
In a separate case earlier this month, Menendez ruled that the federal government could not retaliate against or detain people who are engaging in peaceful and unobtrusive protest.

“The good news is the public worked with us,” he said. “They stayed off the roads to give PennDOT an opportunity to get out and clear the roads, and so we really want to thank the public.”
Some schools, businesses, and government offices remained closed or delayed opening on Monday. The coroner’s office reported three people died while attempting to clear snow in Lehigh County, where about a foot fell.

Carroll called the storm response a “team win.”
“The team included PennDOT, our partners at the state police and [Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency], the public, the trucking community,” Carroll said.
The winter storm moved into the northeast early Sunday morning after spreading snow and ice from Colorado across the deep south to Virginia. By the time it ended early Monday, most places across Pennsylvania had received between 8 and 12 inches of snow. The greatest accumulation reported to the National Weather Service was nearly 25 inches in Jennerstown, Somerset County.
While more than 500,000 homes and businesses remained without power across the south, Pennsylvania was spared the worst of the storm’s freezing rain, which brought down trees and power lines in other states.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A ballot measure that would change voter-approved legislative term limits faces a challenge before the North Dakota Supreme Court.
In a lawsuit filed last week, former Minot lawmaker Sen. Oley Larsen and Grand Forks County commissioner Terry Bjerke claim the Legislature violated the state constitution by creating the measure.
Under an amendment passed by voters in 2022, state lawmakers can serve no more than eight years in the House and eight years in the Senate.
Last year, the statehouse narrowly approved Senate Resolution 4008, which aims to give lawmakers more freedom over how they spend their terms. The resolution creates a ballot measure to allow lawmakers to serve up to 16 years in either chamber. It would also make it so partial terms don’t count against term limits.
The measure will appear on the November election ballot, according to the Secretary of State’s website.
Both Bjerke and Larsen were members of the sponsoring committee to put the term limits amendment on the ballot, according to the lawsuit. The ballot measure passed with 63% approval from voters.
In the lawsuit, filed with the North Dakota Supreme Court, Larsen and Bjerke argue that the resolution violates powers reserved for the public in the state constitution and should not be allowed to go to the ballot. The lawsuit names both the Legislature and the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office as defendants.
The 2022 constitutional amendment, Article XV, mandates that the Legislature “shall not have authority to propose an amendment to this constitution to alter or repeal” the term limits it establishes.
Term limits changes revived for possible statewide vote in North Dakota

Larsen and Bjerke state in the suit that regardless of that provision, another section of the constitution under Article III says that the Legislature must reach a two-thirds majority vote in each chamber to change constitutional amendments within seven years of their effective dates. Senate Resolution 4008 did not meet this threshold, the plaintiffs claim, since it passed the Senate by a 24-23 vote and the House by a vote of 53-39.
If the high court doesn’t act, “an obviously unconstitutional ballot measure will be before the North Dakota electors in November — wasting taxpayer dollars on a plainly unconstitutional referendum,” they write.
An attorney for the plaintiffs, Jesse Walstad, did not return a call seeking comment on Monday.
Lawmakers who supported the resolution have said the Legislature’s ability to put constitutional amendments on the election ballot is protected elsewhere in the constitution. Article IV states that the House and Senate only need to clear a simple majority to refer constitutional measures to the ballot.
“The constitution already says that the Legislature can recommend amendments to the constitution through legislative action,” said Sen. Michael Dwyer, R-Bismarck, the primary sponsor of Senate Resolution 4008.
Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said the Legislature has always taken the position that the two-thirds requirement in Article III doesn’t apply to resolutions.
“The resolution isn’t amending or repealing anything, it’s simply placing on the ballot a measure for the people to have the opportunity to do so,” he said.
Rep. Austen Schauer, R-West Fargo, in testimony on the House floor in April acknowledged that the resolution would likely be challenged in court, but that a lawsuit could help make sense of the conflicting language in the constitution.
“This bill may be useful in terms of having the North Dakota Supreme Court step in and decide if it is constitutional or unconstitutional to limit legislative authority,” he said.
Secretary of State Michael Howe said that while he’s not surprised the resolution is being challenged in court, his agency had a duty to approve the proposal for the ballot. He said state law and previous North Dakota Supreme Court rulings indicate it isn’t the role of his agency to determine whether or not a ballot measure is constitutional.
“We’re just required to perform the certification regardless of the content,” he said.
The Legislature and Secretary of State’s Office have yet to file a response in the suit.
Legislative Management will meet Tuesday to discuss the case.
Bjerke and Larsen in the lawsuit say the case should immediately be heard by the Supreme Court because ballot measures to change the constitution are of “substantial public importance,” because the Supreme Court has a responsibility to settle questions about the Legislature’s constitutional powers and because the general election is quickly approaching.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A bill that would require the state of Florida to develop and maintain a centralized database to provide individuals with felony convictions the information to determine whether they are eligible to have their voting rights restored moved through its first committee stop on Monday.
The proposal (SB 132), sponsored by Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton, comes more than seven years after Floridians approved a constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of felons who had completed their sentences. However, the Legislature passed a requirement that they needed to pay off all their financial obligations imposed by a court to fully restore their voting rights.
That legislative measure limited the pool of Floridians who were initially thought to be eligible to vote when the measure was approved by more than 65% of the voters in November 2018. It also create doubt and in some cases resulted in people being arrested after believing that in fact they were eligible to vote.
Polsky’s legislation would require the Florida Commission on Offender Review to create a website no later than July 1, 2029, to provide individuals who have been disqualified from voting based on a felony conviction (other than murder or a felony sexual offense) “clear instructions” about getting their voting rights restored and to register to vote.
Starting in late 2024, the Division of Elections created a way for people with felony convictions who were unsure about their voting eligibility to request an advisory opinion from the Florida Division of Elections. That process evolved as part of a legal settlement after the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition dropped its 2023 lawsuit against Gov. Ron DeSantis, Secretary of State Cord Byrd, and other Florida election officials.
Polsky’s bill passed unanimously in the Senate Criminal Justice Committee.
A companion bill (HB 273) has been filed in the House by Rep. Felicia Robinson, D-Miami Gardens.
Meanwhile, a related measure (SB 748) sponsored by Sen. LaVon Bracy Davis, D-Ocoee, was also approved by the Senate committee on Monday. Her bill would require that sentencing scoresheets include a notice informing defendants about the effect of their sentences on their voting rights. It would be required that defendants must receive a copy of the scoresheet containing this notice before sentencing. (A companion bill — HB 467 — has been filed in the House by Miami Democratic Rep. Ashley Gantt).
“Providing this notice helps Floridians understand this status under the Constitution, and it helps avoid confusion and unintentional violations that can occur when individuals misunderstand their eligibility,” said Davis. “It’s about clarity, transparency, and making our system work as intended.”
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, applauded both bills.
“This is exactly the direction that we should be heading in — transparency, information — making sure folks understand what voting rights or what other rights are implicated based on some of these convictions that they have and can have them all restored, hopefully in theory, once they have served their time and been in compliance with Florida law,” he said.
Versions of these bills have been advocated for in the past by Democrats without ever getting a hearing, so, in that respect, the committee’s approval on Monday was a small victory in the battle for such legislation. The question is how far supporters can advance during this legislative session. Both bills have two more stops in the Senate. Their House companions have yet to be heard in any committee.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/D1edi1VX4AMOWFK-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Image courtesy U.S. Forest Service)The Montana Environmental Information Center says that Lincoln County has failed to provide documents requested under the state’s right-to-know laws related to the county’s push to change pollution standards in Lake Koocanusa.
MEIC’s complaint, filed before Lincoln County District Court on Jan. 23, stems from a rule-making petition the county submitted to the state last summer seeking a change to the site-specific standards for the element selenium in the transboundary lake.
The current site-specific standard of acceptable concentration is 0.8 micrograms of selenium per liter of water, much more stringent than the federal threshold of 1.5 micrograms per liter, which is the level the county asked the state to consider.
The state Department of Environmental Quality denied the petition — in part because the International Joint Commission, an organization created by the United States and Canada to resolve disputes related to shared waterways, has convened a board of experts to study the issue of transboundary pollution in the Elk-Kootenai River Basin.
MEIC said they filed the lawsuit to ensure the state constitution is being followed.
“We’re in the business of holding our elected officials and corporations accountable,” Derf Johnson, deputy director of MEIC, said in a press release. “When our public resources are offered up as sacrifice to a foreign, for-profit corporation with a history of polluting and leaving a mess, we definitely want to know what happened behind the scenes.”
Lake Koocanusa has long been the center of a fight between environmental groups and industry backers over the leeching of the element selenium into the Elk River in British Columbia from Canadian coal mines. The mining pollution flows downstream into Koocanusa, where concentrations are documented to have quadrupled in the last three decades and threaten aquatic species, including West Slope Cutthroat Trout and White Sturgeon.
While a U.S. Geological Survey study published in 2023 linked the expansion of mining operations with increased selenium and nitrate concentrations over decades, and indicated selenium concentrations in Koocanusa had not met Montana’s site-specific standards since 2020, the owners of the mining operations have pushed for moderating the selenium standard in Lake Koocanusa.
Teck Resources Limited, former owner of Elk Valley Resources, which operates the Canadian coal mines, submitted the same petition as Lincoln County back in 2021, and the current owner, international mining conglomerate Glencore, has continued to dispute the strict standard.
Following Lincoln County’s submission last summer, MEIC and representatives of other environmental organizations pushed back against the petition, saying there is no scientific basis to weaken the standard and pointed to potential impacts to Montana’s robust recreation-based economy that includes a $149 million contribution from boating and fishing.
According to court documents, a few days after the petition was submitted, MEIC submitted a records request to Lincoln County for all documents related to the petition, but has not received any response.
“Lincoln County’s actions could best be characterized as ‘radio silence,'” court filings state. “It has not provided the requested information, nor has it provided a reason for its inaction.”
In the lawsuit, MEIC alleges the county is violating its right to know under the state constitution and public records laws, and seeks a court order forcing Lincoln County to provide the requested information.
Lincoln County Commissioner Neil Duram told the Daily Montanan last year that he had met with representatives of both the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and Elk Valley Resources to discuss the pollution issue. He also said the mining company had given a presentation challenging the science of the existing standard, and offering more recent studies that could be used to argue for a more lenient rule. odd – i just was mentioning him in a story – I didn’t realize you could be both county commish and state rep – is that right? we should mention he’s also state rep
This filing is the latest in a long line of legal disputes orbiting the lake’s selenium standard and the rulemaking process.
There is an ongoing lawsuit between the Montana Board of Environmental Review – a quasi-judicial body that handles environmental permit disputes — Teck, and Lincoln County, and a multitude of environmental groups led by the Montana Environmental Information Center seeking to keep the stronger pollutant standard in place, after the review board overturned the standard. In another suit, MEIC sued the Montana Department of Justice for denying access to communications between Teck and the state.

The cost to house those state inmates  in county jails and in out-of-state facilities has risen sharply. (Photo by Mia Maldonado/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho’s rising rates of incarcerating state prisoners in county jails and out of state have led to skyrocketing costs. The price for operating the state’s 10 prisons are also on the rise, according to the correctional agency director. 
Idaho Department of Correction Director Bree Derrick presented the agency’s budget on Monday to the state budget writers on the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriation Committee. 
“The inflationary cost that we’ve experienced related to inmate supplies has been pretty staggering, so we have some examples where basic things – toilet paper, paper towels – going up between 25% and 26% over the last two or three years,” Derrick said. “So that for us is a huge impact. We also have a population spike that we haven’t seen before at the Department of Correction.” 
Under the governor’s recommendations, the agency’s budget for county and out-of-state placement of people who are incarcerated is expected to grow just over 69% from the current fiscal year. 
 How much does it cost to house Idaho inmates when state prisons are full? 

Gov. Brad Little in his proposed budget recommended the state pay a supplemental payment of $15.2 million in the current fiscal year to cover the difference in what was allocated last year to cover costs of housing people who are incarcerated outside of state prisons, compared to the projected actual costs. Little’s recommendation was based on the incarcerated population numbers through November. 
Little’s budget also calls for $25 million in additional spending in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
As of Jan. 1, there were 10,023 total people incarcerated by the Department of Correction, according to the agency’s population dashboard. The in-state capacity is just over 8,200, according to the dashboard. The state operates 10 prisons.

The available population data shows the inmate population has remained the state’s capacity since 2019, when the data starts. The capacity has increased from around 7,100 in 2019 through a number of projects. 
When the state prisons are full, people who are incarcerated serve their terms either in county jails or out-of-state facilities. 
The reimbursement rate to county jails is set in state code at $55 per resident per day for the first seven days of confinement, and then $75 per resident per day thereafter. The state pays an additional $2.50 per resident per day for medical costs. 
The reimbursement for out-of-state facilities is set by contract. The average daily rate per resident is projected to be about $83 for these contracts, according to the legislative budget book. 
Derrick said Monday that the state’s contract with a facility in Arizona costs the state about $85 per resident per day. 
Based on the October populations, the agency projected the state would house 991 inmates in county jails monthly, and 761 residents in out-of-state facilities monthly. The governor’s budget included higher costs than the agencies’, based on more up-to-date data available through November. The governor’s updated cost projection didn’t include exact numbers of residents. 
The expected total cost of incarcerating people outside of state prisons is expected to be around $51 million.

 Why is the Idaho prison population rising? 

Rep. Brooke Green, D-Boise, on Monday asked what was behind the state’s unprecedented prison population spike. 
Derrick said the agency has recently been trying to determine this. She said the number of people entering facilities has grown, while the rate at which people are released has remained stable. She said that the average length of stay at a facility also seems to be remaining largely unchanged. 
“But there hasn’t been one trend that has really stood out to us,” Derrick said. 
Sen. Phil Hart, R-Kellogg, said “each year the Idaho Legislature creates a new crime, or proves an enhancement or passes some kind of mandatory minimum legislation.” 
He asked if the department had a model to predict the impact of those legislative decisions. 
Derrick said the agency uses a mathematical model to try and predict the impact. Hart also asked how Idaho’s incarceration rate compared to neighboring states. 
Derrick said the state’s rate of incarceration is high compared to national averages and to Idaho’s neighboring states. In 2023, Idaho had the fifth highest rate of incarceration in the nation, at 490 people in prison per 100,000 residents, according to U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported by USA Facts. 
Montana’s rate that year was 438, and Wyoming’s was 378. Oregon and Washington’s rates were much lower, at 291 and 181 respectively. 
Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said she would encourage legislators to look at more programs that may incentivize good behavior in facilities with early release and other policies that may reduce prison populations. 
 IDOC nearly had to furlough entire staff to comply with governor’s budget holdbacks 

The Idaho Department of Correction, known as IDOC, would have had to temporarily furlough its entire staff to comply with mid-year budget holdbacks ordered by the governor earlier this year, according to its director. 
In August, the state faced projected revenues that were $39.1 million behind what had been budgeted for, the Idaho Capital Sun reported at the time. In response, Gov. Brad Little signed an executive order calling on all agencies outside of K-12 public schools to immediately cut their current fiscal year budgets by 3%.
Little’s office told agencies in September to extend those reductions into the next fiscal year and beyond.  
“We got to a place where we were very seriously considering furloughing all of our staff, so 2,200 staff, most of whom are law enforcement officers in the state, which I don’t think is good for public safety,” Derrick said. “But those are the real types of decisions we’re being faced with at this time.” 
The governor exempted IDOC’s budget from the cuts to avoid the mass furloughs. However, the agency is still working to reduce its budget where possible. 
She said planned upgrades through a software meant to track and help reduce recidivism have been slowed. Other software has been reduced or eliminated. 
The governor’s recommendation for the agency’s entire budget — which includes its divisions for management, community corrections, and medical services — totals $388 million of state general funds. The request is about 10% above what was provided by the Legislature last year.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — Families of students who qualify for reduced-price school meals would no longer have to pay a portion of the cost if a bill advancing to its next step in the South Dakota Legislature becomes law.
“The government already plays a role in education,” said Rep. Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, who introduced the bill. “When the state mandates education, it takes on a shared responsibility to ensure that students can succeed while they are there.”
The bill would require $601,000 of state funding annually to reimburse schools, according to Grant Judson from the state’s Bureau of Finance and Management. Students whose families meet income qualifications for the reduced-price program currently pay 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. The rest of the cost is covered by the federal government, which also covers the cost of free meals for students whose families meet stricter income limits.
More than a third of the state’s public school students receive free or reduced-price school meals, according to the South Dakota Department of Education.
The federal government requires that students in the program receive a meal, regardless of whether they have incurred meal debts.
“Even if a child receives a meal, that meal still has to be paid for, the food still must be purchased, the staff must prepare it, and the cost has to come from somewhere,” Wittman told the committee. “Right now, that burden is being covered through a patchwork of local fundraising, philanthropy and the generosity of faith communities and nonprofits.”
Sen. Brandon Wipf, R-Huron, said the cost of the bill seems like “pennies compared to the enormous investment that we make in education.” Other supporters of the bill said students from lower-income families shouldn’t have to worry about meal debt.
The House Education Committee voted 13-1 on Monday at the Capitol in Pierre to send the bill to the House Appropriations Committee for further consideration.

(Photo by Minnesota House Public Information Services)Gov. Tim Walz on Monday issued an executive order to implement weapons screening at the Minnesota State Capitol, using executive authority to bolster security because the split Legislature is unlikely to do so.
Walz’s executive order comes after an advisory legislative committee on Capitol security earlier this month issued a set of recommendations that include the implementation of weapons screening.
“Government cannot function effectively when elected officials fear for their safety. In the last year, Minnesota has seen horrific acts of political violence,” Walz said in a statement. “This executive order will make the Capitol – the central seat of Minnesota’s state government – safer, ensuring the people’s house remains open, welcoming and secure.” 
The weapons screening must be in place by the start of the 2026 legislative session — Feb. 17, according to the executive order.
The executive order is silent about whether people with a permit to carry a gun will still be allowed to do so. But Bob Jacobson, Department of Public Safety commissioner, indicated in a statement that the measure will “ensure what is allowed today is allowed after implementation,” i.e., permit holders will be allowed to carry their firearms — an important concession to Republicans.  
The Advisory Committee on Capitol Area Security has held monthly meetings since the June assassinations of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor-led committee recommended the Capitol implement weapons screenings despite opposition from the two Republicans on the committee, Rep. Jim Nash of Waconia and Sen. Warren Limmer of Maple Grove.
Minnesota Republicans, including the two Republicans on the committee, have been clear they will oppose any restrictions on their right to carry.
Officials did not say how much the weapons screening will cost. The Department of Public Safety, which is in charge of installing the weapons screening, said it’s working through the details.
“We will share more information as soon as it is available, well in advance of implementation, so visitors, staff and legislators can plan for a smooth and predictable experience at the Capitol,” Jacobson said in a statement.
Minnesota’s Capitol has historically been one of the most open in the nation and regularly draws tens of thousands of visitors a year, both tourists and people who want to engage with the legislative process. 
For months, the officials within the Walz administration have said they wanted the weapons screening measures to be approved by the Legislature. But Walz’s executive order signals the governor knew Republicans, who share control of the Minnesota House, won’t pass them. 
Meanwhile, the DFL-controlled state Senate announced the upper chamber would begin screening visitors who enter the small Senate gallery, and implementing a ban on firearms and dangerous weapons, including for gun permit holders. The exceptions are licensed police and the sergeant-at-arms. 
The Minnesota State Patrol last year hired The Axtell Group to conduct a third-party assessment of the Capitol’s security measures. Its top recommendation was to implement weapons screening procedures.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/596812282_1290057636490087_3676829915866584955_n-1024x677.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Proposed legislation in Kansas cracks open state guidelines to allow courts to sentence any kid deemed an offender to juvenile prison, reversing a decade-old effort to treat youth incarceration as a last resort.
Ten years ago, Kansas judges were allowed to sentence kids to juvenile prison regardless of their level of offense. That could include kids adjudicated of a misdemeanor, a low-level or first-time offender, or a low-risk youth. House Bill 2329 is stocked with modifications to the juvenile justice system, and one seeks a return to looser sentencing rules.
Changes to state law in 2016 moved the system toward a rehabilitative model, saving incarceration for high-risk cases and prioritizing prevention and intervention. Megan Milner, deputy secretary for the Kansas Department of Corrections, said Monday she remembers the formerly broad approach to incarcerating children.
“At one point, prior to the reforms in Kansas, we were still sentencing youth who were misdemeanors to the custody of the secretary and the juvenile correctional facility,” Milner said. “Eventually, kids who were adjudicated of things like disorderly conduct were pushed deeper into the system because of some of the statutes that we had.”
Senate lawmakers considered the changes at hearings Thursday and Monday. In addition to broadening sentencing guidelines, the bill would double the limit on detention time for youths, increasing the maximum from 45 days to 90 days. That limit does not apply to kids adjudicated of more serious crimes.
The bill also requires kids who are found to be in possession of a firearm, regardless of whether or not they use it, to serve time in juvenile prison. It mandates courts send to juvenile prison kids deemed high-risk or moderate-risk if they are chronic offenders. And it requires the corrections department to contract with secure youth residential facilities to add between 35-45 beds to avoid placing kids who are in corrections department custody in a foster home.
While foster care providers and law enforcement lined up Thursday to support the bill, the corrections department, advocacy groups and the state’s Juvenile Justice Oversight Committee expressed opposition at a Monday hearing.
Most were interested in addressing a specific population of kids 10 years and older who cross over between the juvenile justice and foster care systems. Those kids have some of the highest risks and needs in each system, but groups differed on which solutions can mitigate the risks and meet kids’ needs.
HB 2329 was put forth as one of the solutions.
The bill was framed as a way to give judges more discretion, but that may not actually be the case. Judges are already able to override rules attached to certain eligibility assessments, such as high, moderate or low risk, to allow for flexibility in deciding where to place kids.
Khavayi Tsimonjela, a youth intern for the Wichita juvenile justice advocacy organization Progeny, said judges are uniquely equipped to gauge a child’s needs, and the state should avoid investing in systems known to be ineffective.
“Accountability does matter,” Tsimonjela said, “but science shows that accountability does not have to be punitive to be effective.”
The bill treats firearm possession and use the same, she said, but there are levels of offenses for a reason.
 
Uncertain progress
Rep. Bob Lewis, a Garden City Republican, introduced the bill last February. The House approved it a month later in a 106-16 vote. It was left behind by the end of the 2025 legislative session, but the Senate Judiciary Committee revived it and plans to work the bill Tuesday to prepare it for a potential Senate vote.
Those who testified Monday against the bill feared it would undo a decade of progress. But those who supported the bill said Thursday that the bill could fill in major gaps that strain service providers
The set of 2016 reforms came up repeatedly in the hearing. Senate Bill 367 expanded community-based programs for justice-involved youths, placed limits on which kids are detained and reduced probation times for misdemeanor and low-level felony crimes. Since its passage, one of the state’s two youth prisons closed and youth prison populations have fallen from 347 kids in detention in 2010 to 110 kids as of July 2025, according to corrections department data.
Milner, deputy secretary of the corrections department, said Monday that components of the bill were counterproductive and “may have a negative impact on youth, families and communities.”
One piece of the bill, expanding reliance on out-of-home placements, which can include secure residential facilities such as group homes or detention centers, is associated with bad outcomes, Milner said.
Incarceration is often treated as a last resort, and Milner said placements should be reserved for youths posing an immediate threat to public safety and at the greatest risk of reoffending. The bill’s changes risk pushing low-risk youths and those who commit low-level crimes deeper into the juvenile justice system, Milner said.
The bill’s proponents focused on the crossover population of juvenile offenders.
Foster care providers EmberHope Connections in Sedgwick County, Saint Francis Ministries in much of central and western Kansas and KVC in northeastern Kansas testified in support of the bill.
They said the foster care system is being treated as a default.
Matt Stephens, vice president of advocacy for Saint Francis, said children entering the system for reasons other than abuse and neglect is evidence of an overwhelmed system.
Of the 2,708 juvenile justice system intakes so far in fiscal year 2026, which began July 1, 1,353 kids, or 50%, were returned to a parent or guardian. Around 580 kids, or 22%, were sent to juvenile prison, and nearly 230 kids, or 8%, entered into the foster care system.
Jim Howell, a Sedgwick County commissioner, said he is asking for a “rebalancing.” The bill addresses the unintended consequences of 2016 reforms and creates a place for kids to go, he said.
“One of those unintended consequences is that we are comingling juvenile offenders with foster kids, children in need of care, kids that are abused and neglected that are basically needing some parents,” Howell said.
He claimed the state is not funding an alternative.
The bill proposes carving into an existing pot that funds prevention and intervention programs, including ones that focus on mentoring, substance use deterrence, behavioral health support, family therapy, coaching workshops, workforce development, future planning, anger management and conflict resolution.
The evidence-based program fund would be gutted to fund the required new beds in secure facilities.
Mike Fonkert, deputy director of Kansas Appleseed, said evidence-based investments exist that can address the concerns of lawmakers, foster care providers, law enforcement, advocates and government agencies alike. Therapeutic foster homes, which are trained to house kids with behavioral needs, are one of those investments.
Several opponents of the bill, along with some proponents, mentioned youth crisis response centers as an alternative solution to increasing reliance on detention. Those centers provide emergency respite for kids with nowhere else to go.
At the core, Fonkert said, are missed decision points in the progression of a kid’s entry into the juvenile justice and foster care systems.
“There’s a hundred ways to attack this,” he said, “but what we’re saying is the nine ways that are in this bill are all pretty bad.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1220145-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

The Arkansas National Guard is shifting its mission to assist emergency medical services in accessing and transferring patients to ambulance crews, according to a news release. 
Guardsmen will also assist when ambulances become stuck and serve as additional manpower when EMS crews must hike to locations with stretchers and equipment. 
Counties receiving support are: Conway, Craighead, Drew, Faulkner, Garland, Hempstead, Hot Spring, Howard, Izard, Jefferson, Lawrence, Miller, Mississippi, Phillips, Pike, Poinsett, Saline and Stone. Craighead and Jefferson counties will be supported by two teams. All other counties will be supported by one team of guardsmen.
The 77th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade will support Saline County only. The 87th Troop Command will support Mississippi, Poinsett, Craighead, Lawrence, Stone and Izard counties. The 39th Infantry Brigade Combat Team will support the remaining counties. 
In total, 121 guardsmen will perform ambulance escort duties around the clock. All guardsmen from the 142nd Field Artillery Brigade and 189th Airlift Wing have been relieved of state active duty.

The Midwest lawmaker is contesting his DUI charge following his arrest last month in Johnson County.
The post Rep. Bill Allemand asks judge to rescind court-ordered alcohol testing during upcoming legislative session appeared first on WyoFile .","Natrona County Republican Rep. Bill Allemand wants to forgo court-ordered alcohol testing during the upcoming legislative session, while a driving under the influence case against him proceeds, recent court filings show. 
A deputy arrested Allemand on Dec. 28 in Buffalo after being pulled over for suspicious driving. The Republican lawmaker from Midwest subsequently pleaded not guilty. 
As a condition of his bond, Allemand is required to undergo random alcohol testing. He is also prohibited from possessing or consuming alcohol or controlled substances, and from being in any bar, liquor store or anywhere else where alcohol is the main item for sale. 
R. Michael Vang, Allemand’s attorney, filed a motion on Jan. 21 asking the court to either entirely rescind the testing condition of his bond or amend the order so Allemand can forgo testing during the upcoming legislative session in Cheyenne. 
The filing points to Allemand’s obligation as a lawmaker to attend the session, which begins Feb. 9, and argues that the Wyoming Constitution protects a “citizen’s fundamental right to be free from unreasonable searches” as well as “reasonable conditions of bond pending trial.”
After Allemand was pulled over, a Johnson County sheriff’s deputy said he found an open can of beer in the center console of the lawmaker’s truck alongside four unopened beers and a loaded pistol on the front passenger seat. Allemand admitted to drinking two beers 15 minutes before the stop and told the deputy “he drinks while driving for anxiety,” according to a police report.
During a field sobriety test, Allemand “lost balance multiple times and almost fell,” forcing the officer to stop the test, according to the affidavit. Police also allege that Allemand had “significant difficulty getting in and out of [the] patrol vehicle.” 
Vang told WyoFile in a statement, “it is not appropriate to have random chemical testing as a condition of bond for someone with no prior history of alcohol or drug abuse for a first offense DUI charge, where the person is presumed innocent and the burden of proof is on the government to prove their guilt.”
A leading DUI defense trial attorney, Vang also pushed back on the accuracy of such testing. 
“I also don’t like random chemical testing because they use what are called presumptive tests, which must be confirmed to prove the presence of alcohol or drugs,” Vang said. “Unfortunately, I see lots of people falsely accused of using alcohol and drugs because the random testing is not conducted with validated scientific methods.”
A hearing in the case is scheduled for Wednesday. 
Voters first elected Allemand in 2022 to represent House District 58, which encompasses a central section of northern Natrona County. He is a member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, a group of Republicans who control the House.

Michelle Davis, R-Whiteland, speaks during a House committee meeting in February 2025. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)President Donald Trump is publicly backing a Republican primary challenger to state Sen. Greg Walker, who was an early and vocal opponent of the Indiana congressional redistricting demanded by the president.
Trump has vowed political revenge against Republican legislators who helped defeat the redistricting bill — and in a Monday social media post he endorsed Rep. Michelle Davis in her challenge to Walker.
“Michelle will be a fantastic replacement for Walker who, for whatever reason, voted against Redistricting in Indiana, which puts the United States Congress in jeopardy,” Trump’s post said.
Davis, a third-term House member from Whiteland, announced her Senate campaign in August after Walker had said he would not seek reelection to the seat he first won in 2006.

But Walker, R-Columbus, earlier this month filed for the May primary, saying he was “greatly concerned when I see Hoosier politics play a surrogate to those national battles.” 
Davis voted in favor of the redistricting plan when it passed the House in December. She said after Walker reversed his decision on seeking reelection that she was continuing her Senate campaign.
Trump’s post called Walker a “‘RINO’ LOSER” — for Republican in name only — and “an America Last politician” for voting against the redrawing of Indiana’s U.S. House maps aimed at helping Republicans win all nine seats.
Walker did not immediately reply to a text message from the Indiana Capital Chronicle seeking comment.
Davis is challenging Walker in Senate District 41, which includes all of Bartholomew County and much of Johnson County south of Indianapolis.











Trump’s post included a graphic claiming Walker would win without his endorsement of Davis.









The president used similar language last week in endorsing a primary challenger to Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle, for also voting against the redistricting bill. Trump said he was supporting Blake Fiechter, a Bluffton City Council member who has not yet filed a candidacy for the Senate seat.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/P2122815-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

That won’t happen. Boo Ferriss Field at Harvey Stadium on the DSU campus in Cleveland is covered in ice and snow. At noon Monday, the temperature was 21 degrees. The wind chill was 7. The weekend forecast is for more freezing temperatures. The DSU Statesmen are sometimes called the Fighting Okra, but they would be more like Eskimos if they played this weekend.
“We’ll play it by ear, but it doesn’t look good, “ Delta State coach Rodney Batts said Monday.

Repairs will have to made to the backstop at Harvey Stadium before any baseball is played.
“The ice on the netting is so heavy with ice, it tore away from the poles,” said Delta State athletic director Mike Kinnison, a former DSU baseball All America and Hall of Fame coach. “In fact, it is so heavy that it bent some of the poles that were holding it up. That will all have to be repaired.”
The good news: Delta State, which must replace 25 seniors who graduated from last year’s team, can continue pre-season workouts in the Bryce Griffis Indoor Practice Facility adjacent to Harvey Stadium.
The Griffis facility was the brainchild of the late Boo Ferriss. For decades, the DSU baseball program was plagued by rainouts – and sometimes early season “ice-outs.” Practice time often was hard to come by.
“Baseball is a game of repetition,” Kinnison said. “You have to do it every day: hitting, pitching, ground balls, double play turns, relay throws, everything. We were missing too much.”
Ferriss spearheaded the drive to raise the money for the indoor facility and secured the lead gift from the late Bryce Griffis, a Starkville timber man and former Delta State baseball and football player.
The 10,400-square-foot facility was completed in December 2000, opened in 2001, and is used by DSU’s baseball, softball, soccer and football teams. In 2004, Kinnison’s Statesmen won a national championship.
Says Batts, whose team worked out indoors Monday, “I don’t know what in the world we would do without it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26152629/ferriss-field.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)New restrictions on sending physical books, magazines and other reading materials to people incarcerated in Arkansas state prisons are on hold for now, the state’s top prison official says.
Arkansas Department of Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace told the Advocate Friday that the restrictions, which were originally approved last month needed to go through the administrative rulemaking process. The restrictions were intended to take effect later this week.
Arkansas inmates restricted from receiving physical books, other media directly under new policy

That process, which takes longer and is more formal than a board policy change, requires sign-off from legislators on the Arkansas Legislative Council. The rulemaking procedure can take months, and Wallace said the department was at the very beginning of the process.
Department spokesperson Rand Champion confirmed that incarcerated people can “still receive printed materials as before” while the rule is pending.
Kaleem Nazeem, a co-director of decARcerate and someone who was previously incarcerated in the Arkansas prison system, applauded the delay, but still expressed concerns and said he hoped the state would reverse the policy.
“I hope they don’t put that type of stringent policy into place where individuals can’t even order books from reputable vendors,” he said.
Under the policy approved last month by Board of Corrections, books wouldn’t be banned outright. While incarcerated people will no longer be able to individually receive physical reading materials, bulk donations of books from libraries or nonprofits to prison libraries would still be permitted.
Supporters of the policy said last month that physical reading materials sent to people inside state prisons were being used to deliver illicit drugs, even when they were ordered from booksellers like Amazon, endangering prison staff and inmates alike.
But the restrictions’ critics say the number of times drugs have been found in books, newspapers and magazines is too small to justify the changes. The restrictions would limit the availability of reading and learning materials to the selections available in prison libraries, or whatever is loaded on tablets, critics argued.
Books provide those incarcerated with crucial connections to their communities, said Sarah Moore, the executive director of the Arkansas Justice Reform Coalition. Physical books are also available to read at any time, she added — which isn’t necessarily the case with tablets.

Larry Rhoden's office, speaks to the state Senate Committee on the Judiciary on Feb. 11, 2025, at the South Dakota Capitol in Pierre. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — A South Dakota legislative committee approved a bill Monday at the Capitol that would remove phone numbers, home addresses and email addresses for law enforcement officers and judges from the state’s publicly available voter roll.
Last year, lawmakers required the state’s entire voter registration list to be made publicly available for free on a state website.
Katie Hruska, the governor’s general counsel, said the disclosure makes judges and law enforcement officers vulnerable to bad actors. The Governor’s Office requested the legislation.
“Certainly the goal of transparency is always there, but it should never drop to the side in favor of reckless distribution of personal information,” Hruska said.

The bill originally would have removed the same information from the records of people elected or appointed to state and federal offices.
Rep. Will Mortenson, R-Fort Pierre, said running for office means accepting the risk of private information becoming public. The House Judiciary Committee approved the legislation 12-1 with an amendment to keep the information of statewide and federal elected and appointed officials public.
The committee rejected a related bill requested by the governor. It would have created a felony crime to punish people who maliciously publicize private information about elected officials, law enforcement officers and judges with the intent to place them in fear of death or injury — a practice sometimes described as “doxing,” when private documents are involved.

Scott Simmons, Mississippi Emergency Management Authority’s external affairs director, said his agency is working to bring 30 generators to North Mississippi hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes and warming centers. He said multiple locations had generators that failed over the weekend, and only some had come back online by Monday morning.
Small, rural facilities in northern Mississippi are bearing the brunt of the storm’s impact.
Tippah County Hospital, a 25-bed facility in Ripley, is operating at full capacity with reduced staff and no running water, CEO Patrick Chapman told Mississippi Today. Staff at the hospital delivered a baby Saturday for the first time in years while attending to a heart attack patient. Staff joined forces and went back and forth between two rooms, offering care to patients facing life and death in “a heartwarming moment,” Chapman said. 
“It shows you how people can take the worst circumstances and bring out the best,” he said.
But staff confronted grim realities outside the hospital brought on by the weekend’s wintry conditions. Monday afternoon, Chapman picked up a nurse for her evening shift. When Chapman arrived, the nurse was sitting in her car trying to stay warm because her house had no heat, he said.

In Winona, Tyler Holmes Memorial Hospital is facing many similar trials. The facility has running water, but is operating on a generator while staff members work overtime, said CEO Cori Bailey. 
Staff held a disaster team meeting Tuesday to make sure the hospital had adequate food, water and beds for staff to shelter in place as long as needed. Bailey said she’s heard that could be up to two weeks. 
“One of my directors rearranged her office so that she could bring something to sleep in and be here for the duration,” Bailey said. 
The hospital has seen an uptick in patients who lost power and had to be admitted to continue life-sustaining treatments. 
“They may not be sick enough that they need to be in the hospital, but they’ve got to have electricity to run their (oxygen) concentrators,” said Bailey.
Starting tomorrow, the hospital will start cancelling appointments. 
“It hurts my heart so bad because these patients need to come in, but also, they may not be able to get here,” Bailey said. 
Greg Flynn, spokesperson for the Mississippi State Department of Health, said there were several nursing homes and long-term care facilities that reported being without power and having difficulties operating generators Sunday, all of which were working with local emergency management authorities to restore power. He said he did not know how many facilities were impacted. 
Cornerstone Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center, a nursing home in Corinth, has been using a generator all weekend, and has a maintenance man staying overnight to ensure all the rooms are well heated. Everyone there is pitching in additional duties, said Monica Jackson, the facility’s human resources officer, who was on phone duty Monday. 
“We are working on little to no staff,” Jackson said. “Our administrator tried to go and pick up a few people that he could. We’ve got a few people who have been here since this all started Friday night – with no relief. They’ve just been taking naps.”
In the counties surrounding Oxford, community mental health workers for Communicare have been stuck at facilities since Friday because other staff members aren’t able to navigate roads — blocked by trees and downed power lines — to relieve them. Executive Director Melody Madaris told Mississippi Today in a text message she does not know how long the on-site employees will have to continue working.
Madaris said she expects most Communicare services will be closed all week, but its crisis intervention team will be available. 
Wendy Bailey, executive director of the Mississippi Department of Mental Health, wrote in an email the community mental health center that serves counties in the state’s northeast corner is closed and without power. 
Getting patients to timely care has become a harrowing experience in many parts of the state, including the Mississippi Delta. Greenwood Leflore Hospital’s emergency room remained open through the storm, though the hospital’s clinics, outpatient rehabilitation center and retail pharmacy were closed Monday. The hospital provided accommodations for in-house staff since Friday, said spokesperson Christine Hemphill.
The hospital’s helipad was cleared Monday morning, allowing two patients to be transferred to a higher level of care, Hemphill said. Three additional patients are awaiting transfer.

Pafford Medical Services, one of the largest ambulance providers in the state and the company that provides medical helicopter services to Greenwood Leflore Hospital, began transporting critically ill or injured patients by air from around the state to hospitals in Jackson and Memphis from select facilities late Sunday after landing pads were cleared of ice. 
Unusually thick ice on helipads and continuous precipitation kept air ambulance services grounded in many areas over the weekend, said Clay Hobbs, chief operating officer of Pafford Medical Services.
By midday Monday, most of the state’s hospital helipads were back in service, he said. The company is working to keep as many aircrafts in the air as possible to transport patients to hospitals that can meet their care needs. The company’s emergency operations center, which opened on Friday, triages air and ground transports to ensure that the patients with the greatest needs and who can be transferred safely are transported first.
“Air Ambulance will be busy for the next two to three days,” Hobbs said. 
Hobbs said the company has seen an increased number of 911 calls for traffic accidents and other medical issues since the storm hit. 
Ambulance providers across the state are working to attend to the health needs of patients, particularly those in areas without power who are receiving oxygen or use medical devices that require electricity. 
“Ambulance providers are the first line of defense for those patients,” he said. 
Pafford ambulances are also working to transport patients to Jackson or Memphis for higher levels of care than local hospitals can provide. Operations are fairly normal, Hobbs said, but emergency providers are still encountering some obstacles. 
One ambulance transporting a patient was stranded on the interstate for several hours this morning after an 18-wheeler blocked traffic and made the road impassable, he said. The patient survived. 
All Baptist Memorial hospitals in the state are open and have power, said spokesperson Kimberly Alexander. However, clinics in north Mississippi were closed Monday, Alexander said, and the system’s Oxford hospital was not offering elective or outpatient surgeries and procedures. They will re-assess on a day-to-day basis, she said. 
All eight North Mississippi Health Services hospital locations are open, said David Wilson, chief operating officer for North Mississippi Health Services and president for North Mississippi Medical Center-Tupelo in a statement. Some clinics and outpatient services are closed today or opening later in the day, and most clinics are expected to return to normal operations Tuesday.

Large hospitals in Jackson say they are operating as usual and are prepared to accept transfers from smaller hospitals. 
The University of Mississippi Medical Center’s main campus in Jackson, the state’s largest hospital, is operating normally, said spokesperson Patrice Guilfoyle. UMMC Holmes County is operating on a generator, and UMMC clinics north of Lexington are closed Monday. 
St. Dominic Hospital in Jackson is currently experiencing typical transfer volumes, but anticipates an increase as road and travel conditions improve, spokesperson Meredith Bailess said in an email. 
“We remain prepared to support the needs of these impacted areas,” Bailess said.
Wendy Bailey, the mental health department executive director, said some of the generators at North Mississippi Regional Center’s community homes for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, which her agency runs, have failed. But at least one of the generators was up and running again by Monday morning. 
The Department’s legislative budget request for the upcoming fiscal year requests more funding to replace the backup power sources at the regional center and North Mississippi State Hospital. After the agency’s board meeting in December, Wendy Bailey said the state hospital’s generator will not pass its upcoming review if it is not replaced. 
“Backup generators are essential to support operations during a power outage,” she said in her Tuesday email. “These programs are providing 24/7 services to some of Mississippi’s most vulnerable residents.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26155413/IMG_7428-1.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s chief of public schools asked state lawmakers for a mostly flat education budget but indicated the state could benefit from a far larger investment.
In a budget hearing at the state Capitol on Monday, state Superintendent Lindel Fields requested $4 billion for public education, $23 million more than the state’s current spend to account for the rising cost of educators’ health insurance. Lawmakers will consider the request when crafting a state budget for the 2027 fiscal year.
He also gave a list of priorities without a cost attached to them: school security, raising first-year teacher salaries, teacher development, school leader training and improving literacy.
Fields described these priorities as fundamentals that would enable the state to execute a broader strategy toward academic improvement, particularly in elementary reading.
“Those are the X’s and O’s,” he said while making a football analogy. “We get those right, I think we can successfully run the plays — this year’s play being early literacy.”
Legislative leaders have said literacy is among their top priorities this year, too. However, when House and Senate lawmakers asked Fields in the joint budget hearing how much he’d like to spend on his priorities, he said he didn’t yet have a specific dollar amount to request.
Although public education is the Legislature’s largest state government expense, Oklahoma ranks near the bottom in the country in per-pupil spending, Fields said, and behind most bordering states in average pay for first-year teachers with $41,152, even when considering cost of living differences. 
He noted Mississippi — whose leap in literacy scores local policymakers hope to emulate — has spent hundreds of millions of dollars specifically to improve its reading outcomes. If Oklahoma hopes to move the needle, he said, “having a reading specialist in every elementary school is a direction we need to head (toward).”
“The numbers add up pretty quickly, to give you a specific number for the future of education,” Fields said. “If we want to be competitive for first-year teachers, if we want to provide safe schools, we want to improve literacy, it’s substantial. It’s a substantial investment.”
Republican lawmakers, though, took note when Fields said about half of the $12,000 Oklahoma spends per pupil is applied to non-instructional expenses. 
“I think one of the areas that is a struggle for this body is when you see record levels of investment but you also see steady growth in non-instructional spending and the growth of that outpacing the growth of classroom expenditures,” said Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, who leads a House subcommittee on education funding.

Some of that, Fields said, comes down to how the state classifies certain expenditures. 
State records show, for example, dollars spent on instructional technology, curriculum development, instructional staff training, school counselors, speech pathology and school libraries all fall outside of the “instruction” category in the state’s accounting system.
Some items on Fields’ priority list would correlate with bills lawmakers already filed ahead of their 2026 legislative session, which begins Feb. 2. 
For example, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, submitted legislation to continue a $50 million-per-year school security program and to set up a framework for school principal training and mentorship.
Multiple lawmakers have filed bills hoping to improve early elementary reading scores and to increase teacher salaries.

Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/ct-unemployment-jobs-report-december-2025/,"The state's labor force contracted as national issues, from tariffs to inflation, created uncertainty for employers.","Connecticut’s unemployment rate ticked up slightly in December from 4% to 4.2%, as the state shed 500 jobs, according to numbers released by state Department of Labor on Monday.
For the full year in 2025, the state’s unemployment rate rose 1% — a notable increase, though unemployment remained low compared to historical figures. Connecticut’s unemployment rate at the end of 2025 was also lower than the national rate of 4.4%. 
But overall, 2025 was a mixed year for the state’s economy, as job growth slowed and the labor force — the number of people working or looking for work — contracted. Some industries experienced declines in jobs even as the state reported GDP growth through the second and third quarters of last year. (Fourth quarter GDP growth hasn’t been reported yet.)
“There was considerable volatility in 2025 with national issues playing a role in dampening Connecticut’s job growth,” Labor Commissioner Danté Bartolomeo said in a statement. “Over the past year, Connecticut’s workforce declined; that makes it harder for employers to hire and it reduces retail and services spending.”
Those “national issues” included tariffs and inflation, both of which have amplified economic uncertainty as their exact effect on the economy over the coming months and years remains unclear. The Connecticut Department of Labor has also cited changes in immigration enforcement as a concern in recent months, noting that the national crackdown could affect this state’s labor force, which has relied on immigrant workers to offset the effects of the state’s aging population.
The latest labor report rounded out a year of stagnation in the state’s labor market. Connecticut currently has a labor force participation rate of 64%, which is higher than the national rate of 62.5%. But some 20,000 people left the labor force in 2025, potentially making it harder for companies to fill open roles.
The state currently reports having some 70,000 job openings.
“Connecticut’s economy has shown resilience through some ups and downs this year,” CTDOL Director of Research Patrick Flaherty said in a statement. “As we’ve said in the past, the state’s economy will follow national trends, so we remain watchful of inflation, the impact of tariffs, and overall hiring.”
Connecticut’s economic picture is mixed – but shows warning signs
Connecticut employers shed 2,200 jobs overall in 2025, despite reported job increases in six out of the twelve months.
In November of last year, Connecticut ranked 37th for job growth in the nation, with states like Missouri, South Carolina and North Carolina landing in the top 10. In 2025, job growth increased 0.4% nationally, while it declined 0.1% in the state. 
Looking at the past year, most of the recent job declines in Connecticut were concentrated in specific job sectors, including retail (- 4,800 jobs), accommodation & food services (-3,000 jobs), and private education (-2,800 jobs). 
The losses were partially offset by growth in sectors like government (+3,200 jobs) and health care (+3,300 jobs). 
The muddled job picture raises concerns about growth in the state, which still has not recovered many of the jobs lost during the Great Recession. Connecticut officials have looked to support investments in emerging technologies and foster workforce growth in science and research-based industries, but business leaders say the state has a ways to go. 
“Connecticut employers and their employees are showing remarkable resilience — navigating uncertainty, innovating, and driving productivity,” Chris DiPentima, president and CEO of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said in a statement. “But innovation alone cannot sustain long-term growth if underlying workforce challenges remain unaddressed.” 
The state Department of Labor acknowledged that some issues holding back job growth were out of the state’s hands, with the national economy currently in flux. Hiring has slowed nationally and it’s unclear exactly how much tariffs could harm U.S.-based companies. DOL’s Flaherty said he is expecting “modest growth” in 2026 so long as the national economy doesn’t tip towards a downturn. 
For now, local and national economists aren’t ringing alarm bells. But the data does suggest Connecticut leaders may look to address the state’s relatively high cost of living, an issue that has repeatedly been cited as straining Connecticut workers and hampering growth. 
With lawmakers returning to Hartford for the 2026 legislative session next week, business advocates say now is the time to act. “Employers are doing their part,” DiPentima said. “If policymakers do the same, Connecticut can put all the pieces together for stronger, more sustainable economic growth.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7454-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

Despite frigid temperatures, New Mexico’s Immigrant and Workers Day of Action drew more than 500 people to the Roundhouse Monday morning rallying for an end to New Mexico’s participation in federal immigrant detention.
Immigrant advocacy groups and residents from across New Mexico urged movement on House Bill 9, which if passed would prohibit local and state government entities from entering into agreements to detain people accused of federal immigration violations.
Last week, HB 9 advanced through its first committee along party lines. Recently, Republican leadership in the house has requested the federal government step in and stop it. 
Monday’s rally followed Saturday’s killing in Minnesota of 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti by federal immigration agents — the second such fatal incident in that city in the last month.
New Mexico lawmakers championing HB9 legislation cited the immigration raids in Minnesota as a reason to pass the bill and resist federal immigration policy. House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) called HB9 “a movement that will help the United States of America find its soul again.”
Source NM recently reported that dozens of immigrants arrested in Minneapolis were shipped to the Torrance County Detention Facility, which is run by private prison operator CoreCivic, in New Mexico.
One attendee at the roundhouse Monday, 26-year-old Andres Esquivel, a campaigns manager at immigrant rights nonprofit New Mexico Dream Team, said the legislation is a long time coming, citing reports of civil rights violations and abusive conditions in the facilities documented by Congress.

“I’m fighting to end federal detention immigration centers, I’m fighting for the rights of all immigrants, including myself, my parents, my friends, my whole community,” Esquivel told Source NM.
Esquivel, who was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, moved to the United States when he was 2 years old. He called the prospect of increased immigration detention in New Mexico “pretty terrifying” for immigrant communities.
“New Mexico has so far seemed to be under the radar, when it comes to ICE activity, which I’m glad about, but I think we need to start organizing more,” he said.
Participants and lawmakers spoke about the recent killings of Pretti and Renee Nicole Good, also 37.

Eder Lopez, 17, a New America high school student from the South Valley in Albuquerque, held a sign memorializing Pretti, calling him an “ICU nurse, neighbor and friend.”
“I’m here to represent my community, and what we stand for,” Lopez told Source NM. “This country wouldn’t be where we are without the immigrant community.”

Norma Dorado, 57, told Source NM in Spanish: “This is a fight for our country, for everything happening with our community.”
Ramon Dorado, 62, who currently works three jobs, also noted Pretti’s and Good’s deaths, and said the Trump administration’s recent actions have heightened immigrants’ fear.
“This administration is very bad, it doesn’t matter who you are,” he said. “They’ve broken the law, they’ve broken the Constitution.”

Seen here in Tallahassee on Jan. 26, 2026. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Brad Bishop is a founder of Offentsive Corp., a Pensacola nonprofit organization aimed at reducing overdoses, homelessness, and human trafficking.
In 2023, his brother Randy had just completed drug treatment in Panama City and was just a few days out of jail when he took what he thought was a Xanax pill.
“It wasn’t Xanax, it was fentanyl,” Bishop told the Senate Criminal Justice Committee on Monday. The drug resulted in his brother’s sudden death.
“He had no reason to believe his life was in danger, but today street drugs are almost always intentionally mixed with fentanyl,” he said.
The Florida Legislature addressed that issue in part when it passed a bill in 2023 that legalized fentanyl testing strips — small pieces of paper capable of detecting whether drugs such as cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamines have been adulterated with that powerful and sometimes deadly drug.
However, the state continues to see more accidental drug overdoses by people taking other danger adulterants such as xylazine and cathinones. That’s why Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Seaside, has introduced legislation (SB 646) that would decriminalize the possession, distribution, and use of drug-testing products “that can detect these deadly adulterants and prevent unnecessary deaths.”
Xylazine, also known as “tranq,” is a veterinary tranquilizer that has been found in some illicit drug supplies. Cathinones, also known as “bath salts,” are a class of lab-made stimulants designed to mimic effects similar to those produced by cocaine and methamphetamines, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
“Thirty-three other states have already decriminalized test strips,” Bishop told the committee. “Test strips provide early warning signs about lethal batches, track emerging synthetics before a fatal overdose, and tie overdoses to distribution patterns, not just death certificates.”
The bill passed unanimously in the committee. It has two more stops before reaching the Senate floor. A companion bill (HB 477)  has been filed in the Florida House by Rep. Michelle Salzman, R-Escambia County.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-2-3-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The westbound Washington Bridge’s ongoing closure is driving a Providence vegan food hall near Interstate 195 out of business after six years, its owner announced Monday.
Now Plant City’s impending closure is taking center stage in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
In a letter to customers posted on its website and social media, Plant City owner Kim Anderson said the South Water Street eatery will permanently close on Sunday, Feb. 8, after experiencing an “immediate and lasting reduction” of guests in the over two years since the westbound highway was shuttered. The food hall opened in 2019.
“Despite our efforts, we could not overcome this,” Anderson wrote.
State officials suddenly closed the westbound lanes of the Washington Bridge on Dec. 13, 2023, after contracted engineers discovered broken anchor rods that put the highway connecting Providence and East Providence at risk of collapse. At the time, the highway carried over 90,000 vehicles per day.
Demolition crews began to remove the bridge in two parts in July 2024, starting with the bridge deck and superstructure with work completed in December. State contractors will now focus their attention on the replacement bridge, which is tentatively scheduled to open in November 2028 under the the timeline set in the $427 million contract awarded to Chicago-based Walsh Construction in June.
Gov. Dan McKee told reporters Monday that his administration will offer state resources to help the roughly 70 employees affected by Plant City’s closure. While lamenting the bridge’s impact, he said dealing with infrastructure changes is part of running a small business during a media availability in Cranston on the state’s response to Sunday’s snowstorm.
“When you have an infrastructure that is interrupted, or is down, whether you’re putting sewer lines in or water lines in by businesses, that it’s going to impact our businesses,” he said“Their overhead is huge, and if they’re not getting the customer base in, they’re making the right decision — I’m just sorry that the bridge played a role in their decision making.”
Helena Buonanno Foulkes, McKee’s 2026 Democratic gubernatorial rival, called the governor’s response to the closure “disconnected” from the state’s economic reality.
“Comparing the bridge closure’s devastating impact on small businesses to routine sewer line work is insulting and dismissive,” Foulkes, a former CVS executive, said in a statement. “Our small business owners deserve leadership that supports them, listens to their challenges and actually works to help, instead of shrugging off the impact of this administration’s failures.”
Anderson has donated to Foulkes’ campaigns for governor. Records show she contributed the maximum $2,000 in both 2024 and 2025 toward Foulkes’ second primary campaign against McKee. Foulkes announced her 2026 gubernatorial bid on Sept. 9, 2025.
Anderson also contributed $1,000 toward Foulkes’ first campaign in 2021. McKee bested Foulkes by three percentage points in the five-way Democratic September 2022 gubernatorial primary.
In a media statement, Anderson noted the ownership team has connected with the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training, whose staff will visit the food hall during the week to connect employees with resources and training.
Anderson’s letter did not disclose details of the financial impact of the closure on Plant City’s Providence location. A representative for Plant City did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Plant City’s locations in Barrington, which opened in 2024, and Warwick, which opened in 2021, will remain open, Anderson’s letter said.
Plant City itself billed itself as the world’s first and largest plant-based food hall and marketplace — serving only 100% plant-based cuisine and products. The Providence space includes four restaurants offering different cuisines, three bars, as well as a coffee bar and retail market.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Democrats unveiled a trio of bills Monday meant to increase affordability for consumers, including a second try at outlawing the use of personal data to set prices and wages.
“Fighting for affordability means exercising the courage to hold wealth and power accountable and to make sure that everyone, regardless of how much money they have, plays by the same set of rules,” Rep. Javier Mabrey, a Denver Democrat, said.
A yet-to-be-introduced bill would ban corporations from using someone’s personal data such as their browsing history, device type, location, shopping patterns and other demographics to set a price or wage. That practice is known as surveillance pricing and was the subject of a Federal Trade Commission study under the Biden administration. New parents, for example, might be shown a higher price for baby thermometers in their search results. People sitting in a store’s parking lot might see a higher price for an item online than someone at home.

A similar bill died in its first committee hearing late last session. This year, Mabrey, House Assistant Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon, Sen. Mike Weissman and Sen. Iman Jodeh will back the legislation. Not only is the bill coming up sooner in the session, they said, but more Coloradans this year are likely to have become aware or been affected by surveillance pricing.
“As consumers, we need to have a say in how we are treated when we go to places like the grocery store,” Bacon said. “As technology advances and (artificial intelligence) becomes more integrated in our everyday lives, practices like surveilling to set prices and wages are driving up costs for us.”
Level the playing field for small businesses
Another bill expected to be introduced in February would prohibit wholesalers from charging small businesses more than bigger retailers. Mike Callicrate, the owner of Ranch Foods Direct in Colorado Springs, said it would help level the playing field for small businesses.
“We have to compete with massive chain retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Whole Foods, Kroger, Albertsons and Safeway that externalize costs on taxpayers and communities while sourcing the cheapest products they can find,” he said. “If we want to stay in business and build resilient communities that can feed themselves, we need bold legislation to make markets fair.”
The wholesale bill will be sponsored by Sens. William Lindstedt of Broomfield and Judy Amabile of Boulder, and Rep. Kyle Brown of Louisville, all Democrats.
The bill will still allow price differences when it comes to volume purchasing and other logistics.
“But it ensures that those small businesses have the same access to wholesale prices that the largest corporations and monopolies in this country use to box out that very competition,” Lindstedt said.
Republican defends price premium
The third bill in the package, House Bill 26-1012, was introduced this month on the first day of the legislative session. The measure would require retailers that sell through delivery apps like Instacart and Door Dash to display how much the delivered item would cost at the store. It would also ban retailers from artificially inflating prices to so-called captive customers, who have limited purchasing options in places like stadiums, hospitals and airports.
“Everyone has experienced the $20 beer at a Nuggets game, the $10 water at the airport or the $80 Tylenol in the emergency room, when people are forced to pay more simply because they are trapped,” Rep. Yara Zokaie, a Fort Collins Democrat, said. “That isn’t a free market. It’s exploitation.”
HB-1012 is sponsored by Zokaie, Lindstedt, Weissman and Brown.
Rep. Chris Richardson, an Elbert County Republican who sits on the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee, said in a statement that the policy would make Colorado an outlier by imposing price ceilings.
“When prices are artificially capped, demand increases while supply shrinks. Vendors cannot cover costs, quality operators exit the market, and consumers are left with fewer options, lower quality, and worse service,” he said. “The bill also ignores the reality of venue economics. Vendors in airports and stadiums pay significantly higher rent and operating costs than businesses outside those facilities. A modest price premium is not price gouging. It is what allows these businesses to stay open at all.”
The bill also has opposition from the Colorado Bankers Association, the Colorado Hospital Association, and the National Western Stock Show and Rodeo. DoorDash, Instacart and Uber are requesting amendments.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Mississippi Today is welcoming two new reporters to its team. Madeline Nguyen will join as an investigative reporter, and Aaron Lampley is the newest reporter on Mississippi Today’s Jackson desk. 
Madeline Nguyen
Nguyen, who just graduated with a master’s degree in investigative journalism from Arizona State University, has joined Mississippi Today for a year-long fellowship from the Roy Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at ASU.
“It’s an honor to join Mississippi Today’s investigative team, whose track record of accountability exemplifies the core mission of local investigative journalism: reporting that makes the community we live in a better place,” Nguyen said. “I’m eager to build on the team’s legacy of highlighting inequities in a criminal justice system where justice is too often absent.”
Lampley, a recent broadcast and digital journalism graduate of Mississippi State University, previously interned with Mississippi Today as a video producer during the summer of 2025. He will contribute to the Jackson team as a reporter with an eye towards bringing stories to life through video.
“Growing up in Mississippi, I saw so many different voices and stories go unheard. I’m so grateful to be a part of Mississippi Today, a team whose mission helps to serve those very individuals,” Lampley said. “Shedding light on the untold stories of Mississippi and its many amazing communities, while also providing them with information they might not otherwise have access to, plays a vital role in helping this state grow and succeed. I’m excited to help carry that mission forward.”

Nguyen, who also has a bachelor’s degree in journalism and mass communications and political science, will work with the nonprofit news organization’s investigative team headed by veteran journalist Jerry Mitchell as well as assist the newsroom as a whole. 
While at Arizona State, Nguyen led a local, long-form investigation for Arizona PBS uncovering key footage that Phoenix police edits out of body-camera videos released to the public. She engineered a custom Excel database tracking the department’s video editing in nearly 100 use-of-force cases by collecting data on hours of footage and filing public records requests for police reports.
Nguyen previously pioneered a new data-focused beat while working as a cost-of-living intern reporter at the Times of San Diego and was a data and research contributor for The Guardian, Consumer Reports and the Food & Environment Network. She also served as a health disparities congressional correspondent for Arizona PBS-Cronkite News’ Washington bureau.  
“We are thrilled to have Madeline Nguyen join our investigative team,” said Debbie Skipper, justice editor at Mississippi Today. “Her skills and innovative approaches will enhance our abilities to further our mission of informing the public and holding decision makers accountable.”
A Noxapater native, Lampley doesn’t hesitate to tackle sensitive subjects, such as a short documentary he directed, filmed and edited while in school that told the stories of two trans Starkville-area residents navigating the fears and fallout of Trump-era policies. He will cover news and human-interest stories in the capital city. 
“I’m delighted to have Aaron back after working with him last summer on a video about one of the city’s biggest news stories of the year, the human impacts of water shutoffs at apartment complexes,” said Jackson Editor Anna Wolfe. “I appreciated his sensitivity when visiting with residents, and I’m eager to see the audience he reaches with this medium.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185133/MT-Featured-Image-General-Logo.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737
,DC,2026-01-26 21:59:14+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Congress hurtles toward partial shutdown after Alex Pretti killing in Minneapolis,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-hurtles-toward-partial-shutdown-after-alex-pretti-killing-minneapolis,,"WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday urged Senate Democrats to advance the government funding package that must become law before the weekend to avoid a partial shutdown, rejecting their proposal to remove the Homeland Security funding bill.Democrats in the upper chamber say they are ready to help pass five of the six bills, but insist the Homeland Security spending measure must be stripped and renegotiated to include more constraints on federal immigration enforcement after officers killed a second American citizen in Minnesota this weekend. “We absolutely do not want to see that funding lapse and we want the Senate to move forward with passing the bipartisan appropriations package that was negotiated on a bipartisan basis,” Leavitt said. Negotiators in Congress have reached bipartisan consensus on each of the dozen full-year government spending bills during the last few months, though the final bills still need to clear the Senate and become law.Funding for hundreds of programs in those measures lapses Friday at midnight, when the stopgap spending law Congress approved at the end of the last shutdown expires.  A partial shutdown would affect the Departments of Defense, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, State, Transportation and Treasury. The Executive Office of the President, Supreme Court and judicial branch would also go without funding if a solution cannot be reached in time. Leavitt said during the briefing that “policy discussions on immigration in Minnesota are happening” and pointed to the phone call that President Donald Trump and Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz had earlier in the day. “But that should not be at the expense of government funding for the American people, which would include FEMA funding,” Leavitt said. “And we are in the midst of the storm that took place over the weekend and many Americans are still being impacted by that.”The Homeland Security appropriations bill funds numerous programs in addition to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. The Coast Guard, Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Flood Insurance Fund, Secret Service and Transportation Security Administration are among the other agencies that rely on the bill for budget authority. Schumer demands removal of DHS bill Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a statement that Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., should remove the Homeland Security funding bill from the larger package before the deadline to avoid a lapse in funding. “The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,” he wrote. “If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.”Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, in a brief floor speech urged lawmakers from both political parties to vote to advance the full funding package, calling the possibility of another shutdown “harmful, unnecessary and disastrous.”“I hope we can come together in a constructive way to get this done and to ensure that we do not lurch into a dangerous and detrimental government shutdown,” she said. Collins did acknowledge the killing of Alex Pretti over the weekend, saying his “tragic death” had “refocused attention on the Homeland Security bill and I recognize that and share the concerns.” “I do want to point out to my colleagues that there are many safeguards that have been put in this bill that I would encourage them to review,” Collins added without going into detail. “And that the vast majority of the funding in this bill, more than 80%, is for non-immigration and non-border security functions.” A Senate Republican aide, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly, said GOP leaders are “determined to not have another government shutdown.” “We will move forward as planned and hope Democrats can find a path forward to join us,” the aide added. A Senate Democratic leadership aide said that “Republicans and the White House have reached out but have not yet raised any realistic solutions.”‘Government shutdowns do not help anyone’Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Katie Britt, R-Ala., wrote in a social media post that the array of programs in that bill “are critical to keeping Americans safe and must be funded.”“We know from recent history that government shutdowns do not help anyone and are not in the best interest of the American people,” Britt wrote, referring to the shutdown of historic length that ended Nov. 12. “As we approach a government funding deadline, I remain committed to finding a pathway forward.”Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee ranking member Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union with Jake Tapper & Dana Bash” that he couldn’t “vote to fund this lawless Department of Homeland Security.” “And remember, it's not just in Minnesota. They're violating the law all over the country,” Murphy said. “I spent last week in Texas where they are locking up 2-year-old and 3-year-old kids who are here in the United States legally, just for the purpose of traumatizing them.”Fetterman, Shaheen part waysPennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman appeared to be the only member of his party in that chamber to support the entire package, writing in a statement he “will never vote to shut our government down, especially our Defense Department.”“I reject the calls to defund or abolish ICE. I strongly disagree with many strategies and practices ICE deployed in Minneapolis, and believe that must change,” Fetterman wrote. “I want a conversation on the DHS appropriations bill and support stripping it from the minibus. It is unlikely that will happen and our country will suffer another shutdown.”New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen backed the strategy of pulling out the Homeland Security spending bill and allowing the other five government funding bills to become law before the shutdown deadline.“The Senate then needs to have a real bipartisan discussion about what additional reforms we need to put in place to prevent tragedies like Minneapolis from happening across the country,” Shaheen wrote in a social media post. “I will vote against DHS’s funding until additional reforms are in place.”",,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-26 21:59:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Another government shutdown? Odds grow amid ICE funding clash,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/another-government-shutdown-odds-grow-amid-ice-funding-clash/,"Senate Democrats, including CT's two U.S. senators, are mostly unified against new funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.","With the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by a federal agent, the likelihood of a partial government shutdown grew as Congress approaches its Friday funding deadline.
Senate Democrats, including Connecticut’s two U.S. senators, are mostly unified against new funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
They want to revise the DHS bill and separate it from a package that funds other government agencies as a way to avoid a shutdown. Republicans are in the majority and would need to make that decision.
Democrats in Congress were already skeptical of more funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the shooting of Renee Good on Jan. 7 by an ICE officer. But resistance to the DHS funding bill solidified after the shooting of Alex Pretti, who was protesting ICE activity in Minneapolis over the weekend.
Ongoing tensions with ICE, on top of the snow storm, are complicating the passage of the funding bills. Senate votes were delayed a day and lawmakers aren’t expected to get to the package until later in the week, right before the Jan. 30 deadline. Plus, any changes to legislation made by the Senate would need approval by the House, which is currently out of session through the end of the week.
While Republicans control the Senate, Democratic votes are still needed to advance most legislation. Lawmakers must reach a 60-vote threshold, meaning Republicans typically need at least seven Democrats to move it toward final passage. But with all GOP senators unlikely to support it, even more support is needed from Democrats.
During negotiations in recent weeks, congressional Democrats were pushing for more reforms to ICE in any compromise funding bill for DHS. Many were disappointed by the final product and acknowledged the bill fell short of their party’s broader demands.
As things stand, Senate GOP leadership doesn’t plan to uncouple the DHS bill from the other five government funding bills, which have wide support. If the Homeland Security funding remains in the package and unchanged, Democrats maintain that senators shouldn’t support it — even with the risks of a partial shutdown.
“We shouldn’t let Republicans bully us again into funding a lawless administration,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in an interview with the Connecticut Mirror prior to the shooting of Pretti over the weekend. “It’s Republicans’ choice to put in front of the Senate a bill that combines DHS funding with other agencies. They’re putting those other agencies at risk by not doing what the House did, having a separate vote on DHS.”
What’s different this time
The possibility of a partial shutdown comes about two months after a record-long closure of the federal government in the fall that lasted for 43 days.
A potential funding lapse this time around would affect a smaller portion of the government since a handful agencies already got their funding approved. And unlike last time, there would be no effect on federal nutrition assistance since the agency that oversees SNAP benefits secured its funding through the end of fiscal year as part of the deal last year to end the government shutdown.
But the remaining agencies that need new full-year funding cover the vast majority of the government’s discretionary spending and would still have some major implications. It would again lead to furloughs of some federal employees in the six government agencies where funding runs out after Jan. 30.
Congress must pass 12 appropriations bills to fund the federal government for fiscal year 2026. The House completed its work last week. Connecticut’s congressional delegation joined most House Democrats in opposing the bill that funds Homeland Security. But in a separate vote that same day, all five members voted for a funding package with the final three bills.
Now, it’s the Senate’ turn to vote on the last six bills, which are all packaged together.
In addition to DHS, the rest of the final package includes funding through the end of September for Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Defense; Transportation and Housing and Urban Development; and the State Department.
Outside of ICE and Border Patrol, the Department of Homeland Security also oversees TSA, FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard.
Since returning to Washington after the holidays, congressional appropriators responsible for drafting and negotiating government funding bills made steady progress on releasing bill text and passing smaller packages with full-year funding for fiscal year 2026. Congress appeared on track to meet Friday’s deadline.
But after the weekend shooting, the Senate Democratic caucus appears in alignment that they can’t accept the current version of the DHS bill. That included those who have been vocally opposed, key members of leadership, appropriators who negotiated the bill and Democrats who voted for the deal that ended the 43-day shutdown in the fall.
Murphy has been strongly opposed to the bill since it was released. And his trip last week to south Texas to learn more about ICE’s enforcement and detainments provided “more evidence of how critical this moment is and how DHS does not deserve to be funded without reforms,” he said.
Murphy, who is the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, said he can’t support funding for DHS without reforms. Some of those demands that didn’t make it into the final bill included preventing U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents from being moved off the border and into the interior, requiring warrants for certain arrests and protocol around mandatory training.
“I just don’t think we will be perceived as credible if we vote to fund DHS’ illegality and abuse for the rest of the year while talking like it’s a moral and legal crisis,” Murphy said.
Murphy said Minneapolis isn’t the only place facing abuses by ICE and other federal agents.
“They are violating the law all over the country. This is a nationwide campaign of lawlessness,” Murphy said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We cannot fund a Department of Homeland Security that is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls all across the country in violation of the law.”
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., echoed those sentiments and said he would also oppose the Homeland Security bill.
“I’m a NO on DHS funding without strict restraints & comprehensive reforms to stop lawless, lethal violence led from the top. Americans are rightly terrified & outraged by the illegal brutality — police state tactics — we’re watching in real time. It must be stopped,” Blumenthal said in a post on X following the fatal shooting in Minneapolis.

Americans are rightly terrified & outraged by the illegal brutality—police state tactics—we’re watching in real time. It must be stopped. 1/— Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) January 25, 2026

“A government shutdown can be readily avoided by splitting the DHS appropriations from other funding measures, as was done in the House. Democrats have a consensus. Republicans should listen to America,” Blumenthal continued.
Even without new funding, ICE received an additional $75 billion allocated over four years in Republicans’ “big beautiful bill” for expanding the agency’s detention capacity and hiring more officers. DHS has been arguing in court filings and to members of Congress showing up to tour detention centers that it is largely operating on money from the special budget reconciliation bill and not through the full-year appropriations laws that Congress seeks to pass through its normal process.
But the Senate is in a much different situation than the House. Senators won’t get the same leeway to vote down the DHS bill but support the rest of the funding measures unless GOP leaders make a change.
“Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement.
As of now, Senate Republican leadership doesn’t plan to detach DHS from the overall legislation and is proceeding with the existing framework.
It is also unclear if Republicans would support adding in additional reforms to ICE. Some have called for a full investigation into the fatal shootings of Pretti and Good, but reiterated their support of the Trump administration’s enforcement actions and the federal agency itself.
“At this point, the White House supports the bipartisan work that was done to advance the bipartisan appropriations package, and we want to see that passed,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Monday’s briefing.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25274448207070-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Senators in a subcommittee Monday rejected a bill that would have enforced clean air act protections on casino floors. 
Sen. Tony Bisignano, D-Des Moines, did not vote in favor of the bill, but made a “promise” that a reversal of the exemption would happen “relatively soon.”
Senate File 2051 would have eliminated an exemption in the Iowa Smokefree Air Act that allows smoking in gambling structures, excursion gambling boats, and racetracks. 
Bisignano, who said he “participates” in casino activities and also serves on the board of directors for Prairie Meadows casino in Des Moines, said “smoking is bad” and that it was an “absurdity” to leave casinos out of the original clean air act.
“Casinos need to take the responsibility … and I think their business plan better start to change, and change quickly, because I will be the one pushing this,” Bisignano said.

Advocates for the bill, including representatives from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Lung Association and American Heart Association, said the bill would protect gambling establishment employees who, under current law, are subject to secondhand smoke during their shifts. 
Lobbyists on behalf of casinos in Iowa argued the bill would put them at a competitive disadvantage with casinos that do allow smoking. 
According to the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, exposure to secondhand smoke for nonsmokers increases the risk of lung cancer by about 20% and the majority of lung cancer is caused by tobacco use and exposure.
“I want to stress that there is no safe level of secondhand smoke exposure, making this an occupational hazard for casino workers,” Jackie Cale said on behalf of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in the subcommittee meeting. 
Cale and other speakers representing health organizations noted that Iowa has some of the highest cancer rates in the nation.
Data gathered by the American Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation show that as of July 2025, 21 U.S. states had laws in place to prohibit smoking in gambling establishments. States with these laws include Iowa’s neighbors, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois, but not Missouri.
Mary Earnhardt, on behalf of the Iowa Gaming Association, opposed the bill and noted that casinos on tribal lands do not have to adhere to smoking laws. She said the bill would “therefore create an uneven regulatory treatment among competitors operating in the same markets, both within and across state lines.” 
Earnhardt also pointed to revenue declines at casinos in Delaware and Shreveport, Louisiana, following local smoking bans. 
Traci Kennedy with Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights opposed these claims, arguing there were additional economic factors that impacted the declines at those casinos. 
“The business model built on smoking in the year 2026 does not make sense,” Kennedy said. “Nearly 90% of the U.S. population are non-smokers, and so we’re catering to a smaller demographic.” 
A study conducted by C3 Gaming, a casino consulting firm, found that the COVID-19 pandemic caused “a radical change in consumer attitudes towards smoking in casinos” and that since the pandemic, casinos that implemented smoking prohibitions have not experienced a drop in revenue. 
Jake Highfill, speaking on behalf of Penn Entertainment and Ameristar, which is expanding a casino in Council Bluffs Iowa, said going to the casino is an “adult decision.” 
“Nobody’s making you go to the casino, it is 100% adults,” Highfill said. “Nobody’s dragging kids across the floor, let adults make adult decisions.” 
Joe Hafley, a former casino employee and representative for Casino Employees Against Smoking Effects, said secondhand smoke was “unavoidable” when he worked at a casino and caused him and other employees to develop persistent coughs and shortness of breath.
“For casino workers, exposure is not optional,” Hafley said. “We cannot step away from it, we breathe it in for the entirety of our shifts …There is no neutral position here. Every delay means more exposure, every delay increases the risk of serious illness.”
Tony Phillips, also with Penn Entertainment and Ameristar, said if the bill were enacted, it would put his company in “a direct competitive disadvantage” with nearby Prairie Flower Casino, operated by the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska. 
Bisignano said “greed” is the force pushing back on this bill. 
“I believe in this industry, but whether it’s Wall Street, or any street, greed isn’t good to me, because people get hurt by greed,” Bisignano said. 
Bisignano, who was joined by Sen. Dawn Driscoll, R-Williamsburg, in voting against the bill, said the bill “wasn’t going to go anywhere” and he didn’t want to give “false hope” by passing it out of the subcommittee. 
Sen. Dennis Guth, R-Klemme, who sponsored the bill and chaired the subcommittee, said he was “grieved” that the government was unable to play “its proper role.”
“The role of government is to protect its citizens, to protect its freedoms, and it’s not about economic development,” Guth said.

(Courtesy of Brown University Health)Aquidneck Island residents breathed a sigh of relief when Brown University Health committed to keeping the Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center at Newport Hospital open through Sept. 30, 2026.
But Rep. Lauren Carson, a Newport Democrat, remains worried about the future of the award-winning labor and delivery unit and the thousands of residents whose health depends upon its services. That’s why Carson has introduced a bill putting up more guardrails against birthing center closures or service reductions.
The legislation, introduced Jan. 22, one day before national Maternal Health Awareness Day, sets up a rigorous review process led by the Rhode Island Department of Health before any birthing center can close, relocate or cut capacity or hours by 25% or more. 
“This issue is a very high priority not only for me but for all of my constituents,” Carson said in an interview Monday. “If you didn’t give birth at Newport Hospital, you were born there.”
Hospital executives last year said low service levels and lack of funding were why it was considering closing the birthing center.  The health care operator reported a $41.2 million profit for fiscal year 2025, which ended in September, according to audited year-end financial statements. 
Backlash from residents, local and state leaders and health care advocates prompted Brown Health to reconsider its cost-cutting move, with the health care operator pledging to keep the labor and delivery unit open through the end of its next fiscal year. A Community Advisory Panel set up by Brown Health held its first meeting in November to evaluate the birthing center’s future.
Carson was hopeful the appointed panel would be inclusive of the broad swath of community members affected. But so far, she hasn’t heard anything about the 12-member panel or its work, nor was she aware of when its second meeting was taking place.
“It’s not really clear to me or my constituents what’s going on there,” Carson said. “I’m the state representative. I would think if they were sharing information with the community, I would at least read about it in the newspaper.”
Members of the community advisory panel were asked to sign confidentiality agreements.
Brown Health’s website says the advisory panel will meet four times. No other meeting dates are listed. 
Nicole Searles, a spokesperson for Newport Hospital, did not answer questions about the advisory panel’s meeting schedule and outreach efforts. 
“Newport Hospital is actively exploring a range of potential strategies to ensure the birthing center’s long-term future and to preserve access to high-quality women’s health care,” Searles said in an emailed statement Monday. “Programs like the birthing center, which provide 24-hour access to critical services to respond to any women’s health emergency, are inherently resource-intense. Sustaining a high-quality program requires dedicated investment in recruiting and retaining specialized physicians and staff to ensure exceptional care.”
Searles continued, “We appreciate Rep Carson’s, and the entire Aquidneck Island delegation’s, continued support of our shared purpose of finding a sustainable path forward that ensures continued access to high-quality women’s health for our community.”
Carson’s bill, which has not yet been scheduled for a hearing, would require the owner of any birthing center to seek approval from the state health department, submitting a formal application at least 180 days beforehand. Notices to municipal leaders, patients, emergency services agencies, media outlets and state legislative leaders would also be required.
The application must include expansive financial documentation — five years of audited financial statements, five-year forward financial projections, capacity reviews, cash on hand, endowment and investments — alongside details on workforce, services, patient load and proposed transition plan. A comparative analysis of three alternatives to closing, including sharing staff with other area health care or facilities and community partnerships, would also be required.
The health department director would be required to review the application, holding at least two public hearings and consulting an independent expert — paid for by the applicant — to consider “sustainability, feasible restructuring alternatives, and pathways to avoid closure or significant reduction of services.”
The health department director can only authorize a closure or reduction in birthing center services if the operator demonstrates “clear and convincing evidence” that the facility cannot be “reasonably sustained” and that there are no other feasible alternatives, according to the bill. The proposed closure also cannot worsen outcomes for maternal or newborn health, racial, economic or geographic disparities, according to the proposed legislation.
Failure to comply with the state review process and application requirements would result in fines of up to $25,000 per violation per day.
Existing state law under the Hospital Conversions Act already requires primary care and emergency service operations to seek health department approval prior to closure. But the review process is shorter (90 days versus 180) and the scope of considerations narrower.
“I really wanted to open this up to discuss a very broad set of issues related to birthing centers,” Carson said. “I wanted to make sure we’re reviewing a wide variety of factors before we come to a conclusion.”
Annemarie Beardsworth, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Health, referred to the existing law governing regulatory reviews for hospital closures in an emailed statement Monday. She did not comment directly on Carson’s proposal. 
Lisa Tomasso, senior vice president of the Hospital Association of Rhode Island, which represents 16 hospitals and health care facilities in Rhode Island, including Newport Hospital, remained noncommittal in a statement Monday. She pledged to review Carson’s proposal and work with her as the legislative process continues. 
A companion bill has not yet been introduced in the Rhode Island Senate. Carson’s bill has also not been scheduled for an initial hearing.
The legislation, if approved, would take effect immediately, guaranteeing its application to a potential closure of the Newport birthing center since Brown Health’s new fiscal year starts on Oct. 1.

A long trend: How the Idaho Legislature has removed local governments’ powers

But after an unusually lengthy debate Monday, the Idaho House State Affairs Committee introduced the bill and removed language that would’ve banned local government entities from flying their own official flags. The new bill by Rep. Ted Hill, a Republican from Eagle, would create fines for government entities that violate a recent state law that banned state and local government entities from flying any flags other than official domestic government and military flags. 
Hill said the bill was targeted at Boise.
He falsely claimed that Boise Mayor Lauren McLean acted alone to make the LGBTQ+ pride flag an official flag of the city. The City Council voted to add the flag and organ donation flags as official city flags in May 2025, BoiseDev reported.
“She just made it so. She’s having to do this because she gave a middle finger to the Legislature, pretty much,” Hill told fellow lawmakers. “‘Hey, I’m not going to follow the law, and I’m going to do it the way I want to do it.’”
After the Utah Legislature passed a similar state law last year, the Salt Lake City council voted to adopt versions of new city flags that resemble the LGTBQ+ pride flag, the transgender pride flag and the Juneteenth flag, Utah News Dispatch reported.

Hill’s bill this year would allow Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador to enforce Idaho’s flag restriction law through lawsuits to stop cities from flying certain flags and seeking civil court fines. The bill would fine government entities that violate the flag ban law $2,000 each day, per each offending flag.
Hill’s bill would also amend last year’s flag ban law to allow Idaho government entities to display official flags of Idaho colleges or universities, and the Basque autonomous community flag.
Rep. Bruce Skaug, a Nampa Republican, proposed introducing the bill but removing the ban on government entities flying city and county flags. The committee widely supported Skaug’s motion on a 12-2 vote, just after a vote to introduce the bill but tweak it to ban flying other states’ flags failed on a 7-7 tie vote.
But after Skaug’s tweak to the bill, it isn’t immediately clear if it would allow Boise to be fined for flying the LGBTQ+ pride flag.
The bill could return for a full committee hearing with public testimony in the coming days and weeks, before it would advance to a full vote in the House. To become law, Idaho bills must pass the House and Senate and avoid the governor’s veto. 
Last year’s Idaho law restricting what flags state and local government entities can display was one of several bills that removed local governments’ powers, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.

Proponents of State Question 836 said they submitted over 200,000 signatures to the Oklahoma Secretary of State for verification. The proposed constitutional amendment required 172,993 signatures.
“We are able to turn in these signatures today because hundreds of hardworking volunteers from every corner of the state stood in the wind, bitter cold, and the snow – even through the holidays – to get this on the ballot,” said Ken Setter, a supporter. “They did that because they understand that we can’t fix what’s broken in our state until we fix how we choose our leaders.”
If approved by voters, State Question 836 would require candidates for most elected offices to appear on a single primary ballot. Party affiliation would be listed.
All voters would be allowed to participate in the primary, regardless of party affiliation or lack of it.
The top two vote getters, regardless of party, would advance to the general election.
Currently, Oklahoma has a closed primary system, although state law allows recognized political parties to open their elections to unaffiliated voters. Democrats in the past have allowed independents to vote in their primaries, but Republicans and Libertarians have not.
All partisan primary elections will be closed to independents for the next two years after the State Election Board said no party notified them that they’d be open to independent voters. 
Supporters said the current closed primary system locks out too many voters and results in extreme conservatives being elected. Open primaries would force candidates to be responsive to all voters, supporters say. They also say the measure would increase voter turnout.
Many races are decided in the primary or primary runoff, leaving some voters with no candidate to pick in a general election, where voter turnout is higher.
The measure sustained a legal challenge and is opposed by more than 100 lawmakers.
In a recent letter, the opposing lawmakers wrote that the measure would limit voter choices, result in lower turnout and would help candidates advance by appealing to fringe voters.
Had the measure been law in 2018, voters would have to pick one of two Democrats for governor because the Republican vote was split among 10 candidates in the primary, the letter said.
The Oklahoma Legislature and all statewide elected offices are controlled by Republicans.
Supporters are hoping to get the state question on the November ballot after the Secretary of State verifies that supporters collected the required number of signatures.

(Photo via Getty Images)A federal judge has criticized what he calls the “indefensible” actions of federal immigration enforcement agents in Iowa, ruling they illegally detained a man in the Muscatine County Jail and then attempted to “cover their tracks” through misleading legal filings.
The case involves 28-year-old Jorge Gonzalez Ochoa of Iowa City, who came to the United States from Colombia in 2024, seeking asylum and alleging he was fleeing persecution in the form of threats and extortion.
In October 2025, while still seeking permission to remain in the United States legally, Gonzalez Ochoa was charged by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with unlawful use of a Social Security number and immigration documents. Prosecutors allege he worked under a false name, using a fraudulent Social Security card and permanent resident card to obtain a job at The Bread Garden Market, a restaurant in Iowa City, where he was arrested.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the subsequent findings of a U.S. magistrate in the case, there were members of the public in the area when Gonzalez Ochoa was arrested at The Bread Garden Market, and they asked the arresting ICE agents to identify themselves.
“No identification was made,” Magistrate Stephen B. Jackson found. “At the time of the arrest, the ICE agents were in plain clothes.”
At a hearing on Gonzalez Ochoa’s subsequent request for pretrial release, ICE agent Jess Liebold testified on behalf of the government but was unable to answer many questions about the case. “Based upon his testimony, it is clear Officer Liebold was not competent to testify,” Jackson later ruled. “Indeed, his testimony and lack of knowledge as to basic, material facts, undermines the government’s (case).”
Jackson noted that “nothing the government presented showed Gonzalez Ochoa posed a serious risk of flight … No evidence was shown to demonstrate he was using fraudulent documents for hiding his identity from ICE or to be able to travel undetected and surreptitiously. Instead, he was apparently using them to work, as he has a family to support. Indeed, the conditions of his release from ICE custody included a GPS monitor which he, apparently, wore in compliance with those conditions, as that is how ICE was able to monitor and locate him.”
Judge calls ICE actions ‘indefensible’ 
On Dec. 22, 2025, with the criminal charges still pending, a federal judge ordered Gonzalez Ochoa’s release, subject to supervision, while the case proceeded toward trial, which is now scheduled for March 2, 2026. The order required ICE to release Gonzalez Ochoa from the Muscatine County Jail at 10 a.m. on Dec. 23, 2025.
At 9:59 a.m. that day, officials with ICE sent the jail an arrest warrant and an accompanying “order to detain” for Gonzalez Ochoa. By law, those two documents should have been accompanied by a “notice to appear,” served in person at the jail, indicating when Gonzalez Ochoa could expect a court hearing on the matter. By all accounts, no such notice was provided, although ICE did eventually send a notice to Gonzalez Ochoa by regular mail.
Gonzalez Ochoa’s attorney, Katherine Melloy Goettel, objected and took ICE and the county jail to court, arguing ICE had unlawfully arrested her client and was keeping him unlawfully detained at the jail. She also argued Gonzalez Ochoa was being illegally denied a bond hearing and his due process rights.










ICE was required to allow Gonzalez Ochoa to be released at 10 a.m., period -- not to arrest him and then scramble around later to backfill crucial missing documents in a misleading way.


– U.S. District Judge Stephen H. Locher


Recently, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher issued a ruling that was highly critical of ICE’s actions in the case.
“With no pending or newly initiated removal proceeding, ICE had no basis as of 10:00 a.m. on Dec. 23, 2025, to issue the arrest warrant or the order to detain Gonzalez Ochoa,” Locher ruled.
He noted that ICE then failed to provide Gonzalez Ochoa with the required notice to appear.
“The only logical explanation is that the Notice to Appear did not yet exist,” Locher found. “In context, it appears that ICE served the Notice to Appear by regular mail to obfuscate the timing of events and suggest that it might have been issued at the same time as the arrest warrant and order to detain. In other words, ICE knew [Locher’s emphasis] it should not have issued the arrest warrant and order to detain in the absence of a notice to appear, but sought to ‘cover its tracks.’ This is unacceptable.”
Locher went on state that “ICE was required to allow Gonzalez Ochoa to be released at 10 a.m., period — not to arrest him and then scramble around later to backfill crucial missing documents in a misleading way… ICE violated federal law and this court’s order dated Dec.  22, 2025, requiring him to be released. Again: This is unacceptable.”
Judge orders bond hearing
As for the argument that ICE was continuing to illegally hold Gonzalez Ochoa in the Muscatine County Jail, Locher ruled in the government’s favor finding that regardless of its earlier, illegal acts, “ICE eventually commenced a new removal proceeding and thus has the authority to detain Gonzalez Ochoa in connection therewith.”
On the issue of whether Gonzalez Ochoa is entitled to a bond hearing, Locher noted that an overwhelming number of judges have found no merit in the government’s argument that such detainees are subject to mandatory detention, and he ordered that a bond hearing for Gonzalez Ochoa be scheduled.
Muscatine County Jail officials said Monday that Gonzalez Ochoa was released on Jan. 9, 2026, seven days after Locher’s order was issued.
Andrew Kahl, the lead attorney for the government in the case, declined to comment on Locher’s ruling, as did MacKenzie Benson Tubbs, the public information officer for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Iowa.
Since June of last year, more than 300 federal judges in 1,600 cases have ruled that the Trump administration’s interpretation of the law on bond hearings is incorrect, ignores decades of past practice, and conflicts other longstanding federal laws on immigration.
Despite those rulings, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, of which ICE is a part, and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to use that interpretation of the law to argue for mandatory detention. In addition, immigration judges — who are not part of the Judicial Branch and instead function as administrative employees of the Executive Branch led by the president — are continuing to deny detainees bond hearings unless otherwise ordered by a federal judge in U.S. District Court.

Delmarva Power & Light filed the electric base-rate case on Dec. 9, 2025, seeking $67.8 million in additional base-rate revenue compared with rates approved in 2024 and an increase in the fixed monthly customer charge from $13.50 to $15.94, state officials said.
Under Delaware law, the company may implement the proposed rates on an interim basis — subject to refund if regulators later reduce or deny part of the request — with interim rates eligible to take effect July 9, 2026, according to the state.
Meyer’s remarks add political pressure, but they do not change the PSC’s docket or authority. In prepared remarks, Meyer said, “I call on the Public Service Commission to stop approving any Delmarva rate hikes,” arguing that “egregious price increases” have been passed along to families.
Public Advocate pushes back
The Delaware Division of the Public Advocate, which represents residential and small-business customers in rate cases, has criticized the filing and urged regulators to take a harder line as bills climb.
The case will move through discovery, testimony and hearings before the commission issues a final order, which state officials have said is expected later in 2026.
History: requests often reduced, rarely fully denied
Delmarva’s filing is its third electric base-rate case in roughly five years, and state officials noted that regulators have allowed “significantly less” than what the company sought across recent filings.
Regulators also have a track record of trimming large requests rather than rubber-stamping them. In one earlier electric rate docket resolved by settlement, the Delaware PSC authorized Delmarva to increase rates by $31.5 million, after the company’s original filing sought about $62.766 million.
At the same time, full denials of base-rate relief are uncommon in utility regulation because commissions are required to set rates that are “just and reasonable” — balancing consumer protections with a utility’s ability to recover prudent costs and earn an allowed return.
Who decides
The five-member Public Service Commission is led by Chairman Dallas Winslow, along with commissioners Joann Conaway, Harold Gray, Kim Drexler and Mike Karia, according to the PSC.
Another bill change is already scheduled
Separately from the base-rate case, new electric supply rates are scheduled to take effect June 1, 2026, state officials have said — a different part of customer bills than base distribution rates.

What it means for your bill
Two big takeaways: (1) this request is still under review, and (2) customers could see changes before the final ruling because of interim-rate rules.
1) A higher fixed charge could raise bills even if you use less power.Delmarva is asking to raise the monthly customer charge from $13.50 to $15.94 — an increase of $2.44 per month that applies regardless of usage.
2) Estimated bill impacts vary — depending on usage and whose calculation you’re reading.Recent reporting has cited different monthly estimates:


Delmarva estimate (example “average” usage): For a residential customer using about 810 kWh/month, Delmarva said the increase would be about $6.42 (about 4.13%) in one set of calculations.


Public comments reported by WBOC: Another estimate cited in coverage projected about $9.30 per month for a non-heating customer (about 16%) and closer to $15 per month for a space-heating customer (about 23%–24%).


Why the difference? The numbers can change based on the assumed monthly usage, how customer classes are defined (heating vs. non-heating), and what costs are included in the calculation.
3) When could you see a change?


Now through early summer: No base-rate increase is in effect yet; the case is still pending.


June 1, 2026: Separate electric supply rates are scheduled to change.


July 9, 2026: Delmarva may be eligible to put base-rate increases into effect on an interim basis, subject to refund, while the PSC finishes the case.


4) If interim rates go up and the PSC later cuts the request, refunds are possible.Interim rates are allowed “subject to refund,” meaning customers can be repaid if the final approved rates are lower than what was collected on an interim basis.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Delmarva_Retouched-5931.jpg,,,2026-01-26 16:56:43.498477

Akers, R-Kanawha, speaks on the House of Delegates floor in Charleston, West Virginia, on Jan. 23, 2026. (Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia House of Delegates members are expected to vote on a bill involving undocumented immigrants this week as national attention turns on the issue after federal immigration officers shot and killed a second U.S. citizen over the weekend.
The House and Senate quickly gaveled in and out Monday due to the ongoing winter storm, and most members were absent as West Virginia is under a state of emergency.
In the GOP-controlled House, members had been expected to vote this week — as early as Tuesday — on a bill that would expand the state’s definitions of human trafficking, smuggling crimes, forced labor and more. The measure establishes specific felony penalties for the illegal transport of adults and minors.
House Bill 4433 defines human smuggling as transporting, isolating and harboring an illegal alien to avoid law enforcement. 
Del. Bill Ridenour, R-Jefferson
“I believe that the federal government is attempting to enforce laws, but that doesn’t mean that the state cannot engage in activities to either facilitate what the federal government is doing or to ensure the protection of our citizens as well,” said bill sponsor Del. Bill Ridenour, R-Jefferson.
Democratic House members are concerned that the bill could penalize church groups or nonprofit organizations helping undocumented immigrants, including giving them a ride to the grocery store.
“My concern is that these types of actions will subject people of faith to criminal penalties and time in jail,” said Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia.
Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia
As the House Judiciary Committee vetted the measure, Hansen asked, “Would they be involved in human smuggling based on this bill?”
Ridenour replied, “If they’re engaged in smuggling individuals into the state, then yes, they would be.” 
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha
On the House floor Friday, Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, attempted to amend the bill by editing the definition of human smuggling to include that it required an intent of financial or material benefit. Her amendment was in an effort to carve out protections for churches and individuals helping undocumented immigrants.
“I think we all want to go after people that are breaking the law,” Young said. “I want to make sure we’re targeting people that are profiting off of exploiting other people. This amendment clarifies that there would be a financial motive for people who are doing this for a capital gain.”
House Judiciary Chairman J.B. Akers, R-Kanawha, said the amendment wasn’t necessary because the bill already provided a safeguard for people working with immigrants without criminal intent.
“If you are someone who receives grant services — a church for example, who is transporting immigrants who may have illegal status — you could then be criminally liable and culpable if we adopt this amendment,” Akers said. “You do not have criminal liability under this bill if your purpose is simply to provide transportation services to someone [or] do a favor for somebody.” 
Akers added that the bill is in line with federal law on human smuggling. He urged rejection of Young’s amendment, and it was voted down.  
The bill also requires that perpetrators pay restitution to adult and child victims of human trafficking regardless of their immigration status after Akers amended it on the House floor last week. A judge would decide what the restitution would be.
The House passed similar measures in 2024 and last year, citing the border crisis. The bills stayed parked in the Senate. 
Lawmakers are scheduled to return to committee meetings and floor sessions on Tuesday.

West Virginians are encouraged to call 211, the state’s 24/7 call center, if they need help during the winter storm. 

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said West Virginia is dealing with a “a very dangerous cocktail” of ice, snow, sleet and cold temperatures. He has declared a State of Emergency for all 55 counties due to the winter storm that started over the weekend. 
“My message to folks becomes very clear: please stay home. Please stay off the roads. Only go out if you have to,” the governor said Monday during a news conference.

Tim Walz and President Donald Trump Monday morning, Trump said he will look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and talk to Homeland Security about independent Minnesota investigations into the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, according to a statement from Walz’s office.
The call is the first public signal of rapprochement after months of angry rhetoric.
In a Truth Social post, Trump said that Walz called him “with the request to work together.” Trump said the call was “very good” and that the two “seemed to be on a similar wavelength.”
Trump also said that he spoke with Walz about his decision to send U.S. border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to oversee ICE operations, which has led to speculation that Trump has lost confidence in current operations.
“He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!” Trump wrote in the post.
The call comes amid a two-month siege in federal immigration enforcement activity that Walz has sharply criticized, including in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece published after the call Monday, and two days after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old Pretti.
Videos from multiple angles of the killing appear to show Pretti disarmed of a gun he never drew before he was shot by federal agents, contradicting the immediate narrative set by senior Trump administration officials that Pretti had posed a clear and present danger. Criticism of Trump’s deployment of over 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota has only grown since then, with some elected Republicans and gun rights groups expressing discomfort with the Trump administration officials placing the blame on Pretti.
Trump seems to be distancing himself from comments made by his administration officials in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller accused Alex Pretti of domestic terrorism Saturday. In a press briefing Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump has not characterized Pretti as a domestic terrorist.
Leavitt still placed the blame for the shootings on Democratic leaders who “have actively defied federal immigration law and the will of the people.”
In the aftermath of the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Pretti, the feds have blocked the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from accessing the crime scene and evidence, impeding an independent state-led investigation. After being ousted from the investigation into the killing of Good, Minnesota prosecutors asked the public for information to try to investigate the shooting without cooperation from the federal government.
The BCA was also impeded by the FBI in its investigation into the nonfatal shooting of Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis in north Minneapolis on January 16, saying in a statement that it has not been permitted to talk with the officer who fired the shot.
In the Monday call, the Walz statement said, Trump “agreed that he would talk to his Department of Homeland Security about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case. The president also agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals.”
Walz’s office also said that the governor reminded Trump that the Minnesota Department of Corrections, which operates state prisons but not county jails, does honor federal “detainers” — written requests from ICE that law enforcement detain an individual for an additional 48 hours to give ICE time to decide to take the person into federal custody to begin removal proceedings. Top Trump administration officials have previously accused Minnesota law enforcement of not honoring detainers, including a claim that 1,360 individuals with ICE detainers are in Minnesota custody.
The Minnesota Department of Corrections created a new website Saturday to combat “ongoing misinformation” from Homeland Security, including clarifying that it does cooperate with ICE on detainers, and that there are around 301, not 1,360, people with ICE detainers in Minnesota state prisons and county jails. The DOC also said that the individual named by Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino as the target of the operation which led to Pretti’s killing did not have a significant criminal history, as Bovino alleged, and was previously released from immigration custody in 2018 — during the first Trump administration.

(Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)The New Mexico official overseeing a newly created statewide Office of Housing on Monday cited “continuing uncertainty” with a federal homelessness prevention program as one reason her office needs $45 million in state funds to reduce homelessness. 
Last November, the federal Housing and Urban Development agency announced unexpected changes to its Continuum of Care grant program that would have resulted in up to 70% cuts to the state’s provision of permanent supportive housing to previously unhoused people. HUD’s Continuum of Care is the agency’s main anti-homelessness program. 
Department of Workforce Solutions Secretary Sarita Nair told the Senate Finance Committee in a presentation Monday that HUD’s announced changes would have threatened $16.7 million in rent payments that currently go to more than 1,000 landlords and 30 providers who help roughly 8,000 households stay housed. 
“That’s over 10,000 people who are in housing and stable, who are currently inside, because of the money that we get from the federal government,” she said.

Multi-state lawsuits filed against HUD shortly after the November announcement prompted HUD to withdraw the announcement. And Nair said a congressional budget committee proposal released earlier this month “actually looks OK” in terms of homelessness funding, including the Continuum of Care and other emergency homelessness grants.
“But what we’re left with is just that continuing uncertainty,” she said, noting that even if the federal budget passes, the state could be in the same precarious position again soon, especially with the potential of more federal government shutdowns.
“Anytime you see that lack of continuity, we’re talking about people physically on the street,” she said. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s budget proposal seeks $110 million for housing, including the $45 million for programs combatting homelessness that would go to Nair’s department. 
Nair said that the request reflects the potential loss of HUD funding and builds on her office’s effort to tackle the state’s growing homelessness population and housing shortage. The Office of Housing became part of Workforce Solutions last April, after the Legislature awarded it more than $100 million to address housing and homelessness. 
Since then, Workforce Solution has announced spending on affordable housing development in Albuquerque and elsewhere, as well as a first-of-its kind statewide grant program for warming centers for unhoused people amid a recent cold snap.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250224-news-workforce-3-1024x674.jpg,,,2026-01-26 16:56:43.498477

(Photo illustration via Getty Images)An Iowa Sente panel gave initial approval Monday to legislation freezing tuition for students heading to state universities starting in 2027.
Senate File 2002 would freeze tuition for resident students entering their first year at a public university, ensuring their payments won’t go up in the following years. If passed, the legislation would go into effect for students starting their first year of college during or after 2027.
Sen. Jesse Green, R-Boone, chaired the subcommittee and was joined by Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, and Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott.

“It sounds like an interesting idea, but there are a host of problems with implementing it,” Quirmbach said. “It may actually wind up costing people more.”
A bill signed into law last year by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds required the Iowa Board of Regents explore potential tuition freezes at Iowa’s public universities. The board completed its study and submitted a report on its findings in November.
According to the report, tuition rate guarantees come with both benefits to students and families and risks for the institutions, mainly revenue erosion and the potential of budget shortfalls and limited ability to provide financial aid and support services to those who need it.
Members of the board of regents agreed to hold back on implementing any new tuition programs until they could see the results of a cap on tuition increases they previously approved that limits tuition increases to no more than the three-year rolling average of the Higher Education Price Index inflation rate.
Jillian Carlson, a state relations officer for the board of regents, cited the study during the subcommittee meeting, saying each state university has “significantly lower” tuition costs than their peer groups’ averages. Many institutions that have implemented tuition freezes have since ended those programs, she said, when economic downturns occur and state support shrinks.
Quirmbach said the board of regents is “doing a responsible thing trying to keep tuition rising too fast” with the tuition cap, and looking back over the past couple of decades, a “failure of the state to maintain support” has driven tuition increases.
If universities can’t raise tuition but still need to balance their budgett, Quirmbach said they would have to frontload charges, making tuition for first-year students higher than it would be otherwise but not increasing it during their undergraduate education. However, for students who drop out after one or two years, he said they’d be saddled with more debt but without the degree to help pay it back.
Students who switch programs while in college would also pose a complication in a tuition freeze, Quirmbach said, as many programs have different tuition levels to deal with program-specific expenses.
“I think if we want to give our families a predictable path for paying for college, we’ve got to keep up our end of the deal and maintain constant support,” Quirmbach said.
Both Green and Gruenhagen expressed interest in seeing the board’s report, and passed the legislation to the full Senate Education Committee in order to keep talks on the topic going.
“I believe it’s worth continuing the conversation, but I do look forward to seeing that study,” Gruenhagen said.

The Tennessee Department of Health confirmed three weather-related deaths as of Sunday night — all in West Tennessee — with one death in Crockett County, one in Haywood County, and one in Obion County.
Temperatures are expected to drop to single-digits Monday night. The National Weather Service issued an Extreme Cold Warning for all of West and Middle Tennessee from Monday evening through noon on Tuesday.
Nursing home residents experiencing a power outage in a small West Tennessee town evacuated their facility Sunday night as weather conditions worsened and temperatures continued to plummet. 
West Tennessee town without power, water for 18+ hours
Adamsville, a community of about 2,200 people in Hardin and McNairy counties, has been without water for at least 18 hours. The water service interruption is linked to widespread power outages that persist across most of McNairy County, according to the county’s emergency management agency.
Water service cannot be restored until power is restored, the agency announced on social media on Sunday night. Once water service is restored, the Adamsville water system will be under a boil water notice, the city stated. Residents should strain water through a clean cloth to remove particles and then bring the water to a rolling boil for at least one minute.
Adamsville resident Bethany Willard’s home lost power at around 3:30 a.m. Saturday. Willard and her two daughters are staying warm in one room with extra layers of clothing and blankets. The rest of the house is “ice cold,” and the water froze this morning, she told the Lookout over text. 
A family member delivered a propane heater Monday morning with about 12 hours of propane that they are conserving by using it for short periods, Willard said. They have a bathtub full of water and some extra water containers. The nearest warming station is about 15 minutes down the road from her home, but road conditions are dangerous.
“Right now, my biggest concern is not having a way to contact someone if we need help, if my phone dies and the power still isn’t on,” she wrote. “My cell service hasn’t worked until now. So we’re just hoping and praying that it will be (back on) any time.”

Madison County Fire Rescue and West Tennessee Healthcare Medical Center Emergency Medical Services evacuated 78 residents of an Adamsville nursing home to facilities in Jackson, Henderson and Collierville on Sunday night. The fire rescue team deployed to the nursing home to help Madison County Health set up a heating unit there but determined that evacuation was the safest option given worsening weather conditions, Madison County Fire Rescue posted on social media Monday. 
There have been no other evacuations from the county, McNairy County Emergency Management Agency Director Allen Strickland told the Lookout Monday morning.
Hardin County warming shelters nearing capacity
The two warming shelters in Hardin County are nearing capacity, Hardin County Emergency Management Agency Director LaRae Smiley-Sliger said Monday around 1:30 p.m. 
“At the moment, we are trying to look at opening an additional shelter, however, we have no resources available,” Smiley-Sliger said in a video streamed on Facebook. “I need volunteers to run that shelter … and I need food. Obviously, it’s hard to get stuff in right now.”
The shelter at People’s Tabernacle Church is becoming overloaded, she said, though limited space remains at Voices of Savannah. 
Road conditions are still treacherous — most main roads in Hardin County are “passable at best,” and side roads are “horrible,” Smiley-Sliger said. She encouraged everyone who is able to safely stay home to remain in their houses. People who are able to get out and willing to volunteer at a warming shelter should contact Hardin County EMA on Facebook, she said.
Those who are unable to leave their homes, without power and needing assistance reaching a warming center should also message the agency on Facebook, Smiley-Sliger said.
“We’ll be glad to attempt to get resources to you,” she said. “Right now, every resource in the county — fire, law enforcement, EMS, EMA — all of us are taxed. We’re doing the best we can.”
Electric services report working through dangerous conditions to restore power
Hardin County Fire Department Chief Melvin Martin described “total devastation with trees across all the roads” around 11 a.m. Monday. He said the county’s priority is clearing the roadways and getting power back on, but trees are still falling and complicating recovery efforts.
Local utilities and Pickwick Electric Cooperative, which provides power services to McNairy County in addition to portions of surrounding counties, reported 10,645 customers remained without power as of 11:30 a.m. Monday, down from 14,743 early Sunday. 
“Our crew members reported to work as quickly as possible … we have had several close calls and near misses due to falling trees, slick road conditions, and extreme cold as we have worked,” the cooperative stated on Facebook.
Outside help from multiple other utilities from neighboring counties to states as far as Florida have begun to arrive, and the cooperative is prioritizing power restoration to water pumps, health care buildings, nursing homes and other essential services, according to the cooperative’s Facebook post. 
“These conditions are extreme,” the cooperative stated. “Our crews have at times had to cut their way into spots to put a line up only to have a tree tear it back down.”

Davidson County residents and businesses account for more than 166,000 of customers without power as of 2:30 p.m. Monday, according to the Nashville Electric Service. The utility reported at least 153 broken poles. Power has been restored to 68,000 customers of the 230,000 that reported losing power over the weekend.
Nashville Electric Service reported doubling its workforce as of Monday, deploying about 400 line workers in addition to vegetation management and supplemental contract crews.
The utility stated that it can only safely reconnect power to buildings with undamaged weather heads, power masts and meter bases. Homeowners are responsible for this equipment and should contact a licensed electrician for repairs, Nashville Electric Service stated.
Gov. Lee: Tennessee facing ‘historic levels of snow and ice’
In an appearance on “Fox & Friends” Monday morning, Gov. Bill Lee described “historic levels of snow and ice” followed by frigid temperatures as low as single digits. 
“Our primary focus is … security of people’s lives,” he said.
More than 100 warming centers are open throughout the state, with locations available on the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency’s website. 
Lee also expressed gratitude for President Donald Trump’s quick approval of an emergency declaration for Tennessee, allowing the state to access resources from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for protective measures. This includes support for state-led efforts to restore power, clear roadways for emergency services, and other services to save lives and limit property damage, according to FEMA. 
Lee said the Tennessee Department of Transportation, Tennessee Highway Patrol, the National Guard and local and federal officials are cooperating in the storm response.

Michigan’s Extreme Risk Protection Order, or ERPO, law, which allows a person’s firearms to be temporarily removed from their possession in the case of a mental health crisis, was a point of focus for the 10th Annual Suicide Prevention Education Summit, hosted last week by Kevin’s Song, a Michigan charity aiming to grow awareness on the causes of suicide, as well as the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan. 
For April Zeoli, an associate professor of public health and a director at the Institute for Firearm Injury Prevention at the University of Michigan, the red flag law in Michigan is crucial for suicide prevention.
“What we know in research is that there are people who would be alive today if they hadn’t had access to a firearm when they were acutely suicidal,” Zeoli said in an opening keynote speech. “We also know that there are people who didn’t die because they didn’t have access to a firearm when they were acutely suicide, and extreme risk protection orders can help limit access to firearms.”
She noted that, of the 22 states that currently have some kind of red flag law on the books, many put those laws into place after a mass shooting, like that at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida or at Oxford High School in Michigan. Despite that, these laws are often used to prevent firearms being used in suicides as opposed to homicides or mass shootings. 
“We’re seeing cases in our work that we wish somebody knew what the ERPO was and that they had utilized it effectively,” said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller, emphasizing the importance of spreading information on how to effectively utilize these types of orders. “We have very few in our county.”

ERPOs are broadly popular across the United States, Zeoli said, and while firearm owners tend to have slightly lower levels of support for these types of laws, they are still overwhelmingly supported across the board.
“79% of gun owners said this is a good law. 89% of non gun owners said this is a good law. You can look at NRA members, non-NRA members,” she said. “You can break this down however you want, race, gender. A large majority, and when I say large, I mean over 70% of each group, finds that they support these laws.”
In Lansing, however, House Republicans have taken up legislation to overturn the ERPO law, arguing that even a temporary restriction on a person’s access to firearms is a violation of the Second Amendment. 
Fuller pushed back strongly against those concerns in a panel at the event. 
“There is no part of this that is against anyone’s constitutional rights. We have seen proven success,” he said. “Law enforcement can’t just take your firearms.”
“For our friends who want to repeal ERPO, I point to Florida,” added Danielle Hagaman-Clark, the Criminal Bureau Chief of the Michigan Department of Attorney General. “Florida is one of the most conservative states in terms of ideology, and they’ve had ERPO on the books since 2018, and have had over 10 thousand ERPOs that have been done in their state, and so they clearly work. They clearly are bipartisan in nature.”
Even some elected officials who were initially opposed to the law have come around to it, Zeoli added. 
“The sheriff in Livingston County went on the record before the ERPO law passed, and said that he wasn’t going to use these. He thought that they were unconstitutional, that the law shouldn’t be passed, and if it’s passed, he’s not going to use them,” she said. “He has used them.”

The role of firearms in suicide prevention was a key discussion topic at the event, even outside of discussions of the ERPO law. Cynthia Ewell-Foster, a clinical professor at the University of Michigan and Sarah Derwin, a health educator for the Marquette County Health Department, explained that especially in rural communities, firearms are involved in a high proportion of suicides — and for kids, that is often guns owned by their parents or grandparents. 
“We don’t want to start having conversations about firearms after we know that the kid is at risk for suicide. Let’s back it up and have those conversations while everybody’s doing okay,” Ewell-Foster said. “Let’s talk about it like bike helmets and seat belts and something that’s good for everybody.”
The ERPO system is not perfect, Hagaman-Clark said, and there are improvements she would like to see made — especially in terms of helping resolve the underlying issues that caused the ERPO to be granted in the first place.

“We’re good, at this point, at taking guns, right? We’re a gun taking state,” she said. “But what are we doing to make sure that that person who’s had their guns taken is doing anything to get back on the path to wellness?”
But despite that, Hagaman-Clark said that she was “really encouraged” by the use of ERPOs in Michigan in the last two years that the law has been in place.
“We’ve seen other states that have had this law in place, and have far fewer numbers even than what Michigan has,” she said. “I’m encouraged, and I think that the numbers of ERPOs are only going to go up as the word gets spread and as people recognize that it is an opportunity or another way in which we can keep our loved ones safe.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_3849-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 16:56:43.498477

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)NJ Transit resumed limited service Monday after a one-day suspension while a storm blanketed parts of the state with up to 17 inches of snow, Gov. Mikie Sherrill said Monday.
Sherrill, speaking to reporters in Maplewood, commended the state Department of Transportation and transit officials for working throughout the storm to ensure people could safely travel.
“We saw everyone working together and at a really high level of preparation. It was pretty impressive, and the people of New Jersey, I think, should be very, very proud of their public workers and the people who serve the public for all of the hard work they did around the clock,” she said.
Gov. Sherrill says impeachment of U.S. homeland security chief ‘has to happen immediately’

As of early Monday afternoon, about 85 bus lines were operating — the agency oversees more than 250 bus routes — and most train lines were running on a weekend schedule. Trains will continue to operate on a weekend schedule on Tuesday, and commuters should expect some delays.
Sunday’s snowstorm marked the first major storm under Sherrill, who took office last Tuesday. She said she had been in contact with state officials during the transition period, aware that her swearing-in would take place in the middle of winter.
The storm was seen as her first major test, since extreme weather bedeviled some of her predecessors during their first years in office. A 2018 storm under former Gov. Phil Murphy led to massive gridlock on state highways and local roads, while ex-Gov. Chris Christie was criticized for remaining on vacation at Disney World when a blizzard hit in 2010.
Sherrill declared a state of emergency starting Saturday (she ended it Monday) and announced a temporary suspension of transit service, cutting bus, light rail, and access link services all day Sunday, with train service ending at 2 p.m. that day.
On Monday, NJ Transit President Kris Kolluri thanked Sherrill for leading with “pragmatism that we sorely needed.” The transit agency typically suffers during times of extreme heat and extreme cold.
“The storm is clearly over, but I remind everybody that the cold weather wreaks havoc on the infrastructure. Not just on our infrastructure, but the northeast corridor infrastructure, which is so critical for our service,” he said.
Kolluri also urged municipalities that own bus shelters to clean them to avoid having riders stand on roadways.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Georgia’s two Democratic senators are joining their colleagues in the U.S. Senate in a pledge to vote against a spending package that includes billions of dollars in funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Senators have until Friday to pass the package of six bills, which includes a $64.4 billion Homeland Security appropriations bill that funds Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Border Patrol. Failure to pass the package could lead to a partial government shutdown.
Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are joining other members of their caucus in refusing to support the department in the wake of a second fatal shooting caught on camera in Minneapolis by a federal agent amid an immigration crackdown in the city.
The latest victim, a man killed on Saturday, was identified by authorities as 37-year-old Alex Pretti, U.S. citizen and registered nurse.
According to Reuters, the latest incident was one of five shootings involving federal agents in January, including the videotaped shooting death of 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, which sparked demonstrations around the country, including in Georgia. Reuters reports that at least six immigrants have died in federal custody this month.
“Massively deployed and ill-trained Federal forces are violating civil liberties with impunity and showing reckless disregard for life and property,” Ossoff said in a statement. “Masked federal agents are detaining citizens without cause and raiding Americans’ homes without a judge’s warrant. A growing number of Americans have been assaulted or killed. This cannot be America. Democrats and Republicans alike must act to stop this spiraling chaos and protect our Constitutional rights.”
Ossoff is up for re-election in November.
Sen. Raphael Warnock echoed Ossoff’s comments in a social media post.
“I will vote NO on the funding bill for Trump’s ICE,” Warnock wrote. “They are killing Americans. Detaining children. Trampling our freedoms. We are losing our humanity.This is a defining moment for our nation. A moment for moral courage. We must stand together and say no.”
Senate Republicans need at least seven Democrats to vote for the spending measures to reach the needed 60-vote threshold, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, citing the killings of Pretti and Good, said his caucus will not provide the votes and called on the DHS bill to be split from the other five.
Gun rights
Federal officials characterized Pretti as a would-be terrorist intending to kill law enforcement, but videos of the incident seem to contradict those claims. Video does not appear to show Pretti brandishing his weapon or fighting with agents but does show an agent removing Pretti’s gun from his person before he is shot multiple times while on the ground.
Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a concealed carry permit and no criminal record, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.
Congressman Mike Collins, one of the Georgia Republicans vying to challenge Ossoff in November, addressed the incident in a social media post Saturday.
“Please do not fight with or interfere with law enforcement doing their job,” he wrote. “Please do not fight with or interfere with law enforcement doing their job and be armed while doing so.”
Members of the Libertarian Party of Georgia have said criticism of Pretti being armed at the protest is contrary to the Second Amendment and characterized the Minneapolis ICE action as extreme government overreach.
“The Libertarian Party of Georgia platform is explicit: government force must be strictly limited to the protection of individual rights to life, liberty, and property,” the party said in a statement Sunday. “Laws should apply only to violations involving force or fraud, and government must never be permitted to violate the rights it claims to protect. When federal agencies operate beyond these limits, they undermine public trust and erode constitutional protections for everyone.”
Election fallout
In a Monday press release, Ossoff called on his three main Republican rivals, Collins, Congressman Buddy Carter and former football coach Derek Dooley to repudiate the federal deployments in Minneapolis and other U.S. cities.
“Americans left, right, and center are shocked by the Trump Administration’s abuses of civil liberties and police state tactics. My opponents have a clear choice: do they stand with Trump or with Americans’ Constitutional rights? I challenge each of them to condemn and demand an end to the Trump Administration chaos that is undermining Americans’ core civil liberties,” Ossoff wrote.
In an email, Carter’s campaign said the congressman stands by an op-ed published in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution before the Pretti shooting calling for an increased ICE presence in Atlanta to deal with crimes committed by immigrants who are here illegally.
Carter accused Ossoff of prioritizing immigrants and criminals over funding the government.
“Ossoff is putting pedophiles, murderers, and rapists ahead of public safety,” he wrote. “Where was his outrage when Laken Riley’s rights were taken by a violent illegal from Venezuela? His faux anger is nothing more than a fearmongering fundraising tactic that will continue to put Americans in harm’s way by radicalizing them against the law enforcement agents charged with keeping them safe.”
Collins’ campaign pointed to a social media post criticizing Ossoff for what Collins characterized as being willing to risk a government shutdown.
“Last October, Jon Ossoff voted to shut down the government to give healthcare to illegal immigrants, blocking SNAP funds for hundreds of thousands of Georgians, delaying millions of dollars in Hurricane Helene relief for Georgia farmers, and throwing our country into turmoil,” Collins wrote on social media. “Today, he announced that he’s ready to shut down the government again to stop the Department of Homeland Security from detaining and deporting criminals he let into our country.”
Dooley’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
Georgia Democrats call for action
The latest killing spurred an outpour of reaction from Georgia politicians, particularly Democrats.
Following the Good shooting, Georgia Democrats called for a raft of legislation designed to limit the powers of ICE and other federal agents.
The bills proposed by Senate Democrats include requiring ICE agents to show their faces and badges while conducting operations and banning operations from places like churches and schools, passing them into law under a Republican-controlled legislature would be a difficult task.
Democrats are also pushing back against a proposed “large-scale” immigrant detention center in Social Circle southeast of Atlanta first reported on by the Washington Post.
The facility would reportedly hold between 5,000 and 10,000 detainees and be one of seven such facilities built around the country.
Georgia House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley, a Columbus Democrat, said in a Monday statement citing Good and Pretti that such a facility would “bring the same chaos and heartbreak we’ve witnessed in Minnesota to our own communities here in Georgia.”
“We cannot — and will not — stand by while the administration replicates its failed Minnesota approach here in Georgia,” Hugley said. “Our children should not have to fear that their parents won’t come home. Our families should not live in constant terror. Our communities deserve better than to become testing grounds for policies that have already proven devastating elsewhere.”

Jeff Shipley spoke to a Senate subcommittee Jan. 26, 2026 considering a bill banning ""geoengineering"" activities. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)An Iowa Senate subcommittee advanced a bill Monday that would make it a crime to engage in any acts attempting to alter the weather.
Senate Study Bill 3010 bans “geoengineering” activities for acts intending to “manipulate or alter the weather.” The legislation specifically points to activities like “cloud seeding,” “weather engineering” and “polluting atmospheric activity” — meaning the deliberate discharge of materials, including chemical substances, electromagnetic fields or pulses, sound waves or light pollution — with the intention to alter weather.
The measure would create a Class D criminal felony for people engaging in these activities, punishable by up to five years of incarceration and fines between $1,025 and $10,245. The bill states each day a person commits a violation of this ban counts as a separate offense. It also specifies that if an entity is suspected of committing “geoengineering” activities, the Iowa Department of Public Safety is directed to issue a cease and desist letter.

The measure is similar to a bill advanced through the Iowa House committee process during the 2025 session, House File 927. The two measures have slightly different language, with the House language prohibiting specifically “intentional emission of air contaminants into the atmosphere with the express purpose of affecting temperature, weather, or the intensity of sunlight.” The House measure would not impose criminal penalties, but would have required the Environmental Protection Commission to adopt emergency rules related to air quality that would address these practices.
Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, who introduced the Senate bill, said the measure was “the most compact version and the most reasonable version we could put together” to address some constituents’ concerns about cloud seeding and other alleged weather-altering methods.
Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Fairfield, told senators at the subcommittee meeting he appreciated the measure being brought forward, and said he believed it was important for the state to establish rules on how these practices can take place.
Shipley said currently, “if I wanted to say, deploy a cloud seeding program over Van Buren County, there’s nothing in law, to my knowledge that’s currently preventing me from doing that, or any sort of regulation of oversight of that sort of activity.” He pointed to a 2025 law signed Florida as an example of what could be brought up in Iowa.
“Obviously, there’s a lot of appetite in the public in this discussion,” Shipley said. “There’s a lot of theories in the public about what could or cannot be going on. There’s a lot of various approaches that could be taken.”
One of the main drivers of conversations on geoengineering and related practices is the “chemtrails” conspiracy theory, which posits some aircraft are spraying certain chemicals that impact weather patterns as well as people’s health and fertility. Advocates with groups like the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers spoke against the bill, saying the proposal is referencing and validating “pseudoscience” instead of addressing real environmental concerns.
One confirmed practice referenced in the bill is cloud seeding, where certain particles, like silver iodide crystals and salt, are added to existing clouds in order to cause rain or snow to fall that would not occur naturally. While there are not reports of the widespread use of cloud seeding in Iowa, this practice has been used in several western states to address drought or minimize hail damage.
Grayson Gee with the Rainmaker Technology Corporation, a U.S.-based cloud seeding startup, spoke in opposition to the inclusion of cloud seeding in the measure targeted at geoengineering practices.
Gee said cloud seeding has been “researched, regulated and transparently conducted in the United States for over 70 years,” and that it does not change weather patterns outside of encouraging precipitation.
“Cloud seeding doesn’t alter the temperature, doesn’t alter the sunlight, it doesn’t alter climate systems,” Gee said. “It doesn’t create clouds or storms, and it can’t produce precipitation out of clear skies. Its effectiveness depends entirely on the presence of suitable atmospheric conditions provided by nature.”
He said other proposed technologies related to geoengineering, like solar radiation modification or other stratospheric aerosol injection, are not well-studied or researched and have the potential to cause serious harm. Gee said it was important to distinguish between these ideas, which he called “conspiratorial and, frankly, somewhat concerning,” and existing practices like cloud seeding.
The measure was passed out of subcommittee unanimously. Sen. Izaah Knox, D-Des Moines, said he supported the bill moving forward as “there needs to be more conversation about this,” though he was not sure the current language is the correct approach. McClintock said there are still many steps before the bill would become law, but said he believed lawmakers are moving with “due diligence” to address Iowans’ concerns on the issue.

WILMINGTON, Del. — A Delaware-shot comedy is headed for a Maryland debut on the big screen — and the filmmakers are also urging Delaware audiences to stream it at home to catch familiar local sites, small businesses, and community faces in a feature film that’s a rare “made here” production for the First State.
The State Theatre in Harve de Grace, MD with be the premiere of the locally filmed movie The Conspiracists on 1/30/2026
The Conspiracists, a comedy mockumentary directed by Michael Perrie Jr. and co-written with Lacy Reily, screens Friday, Jan. 30, at The State Theater in Havre de Grace, Maryland, with a red-carpet arrival and a Q&A with cast and filmmakers, according to the production’s media alert.
The 2025 independent feature follows siblings Daisy and Eric Sureloc as they attempt to launch the world’s first all-inclusive conspiracy convention, “ConCon,” only to see their plans spiral into chaos and unexpected revelations.
While the Havre de Grace event is designed for a live audience, the film is already widely available — offering Delaware viewers an easy way to support a local project and play “spot the location” from the couch. The film is streaming on Amazon Prime Video and Verizon Fios, with additional distribution handled by Buffalo 8.
Delaware people in the credits
The film’s production team includes multiple Delaware-connected credits, including:


Christopher Robert Bruce, founder of Wilmington-based King Creative, is an executive producer.


Edward (Eddie) Layfield, an executive producer with Uncultured Swine, is a Delaware native.


Terrie Lynne, who plays Daisy, is an alumna of the Cab Calloway School of the Arts.


Guy Wellman, part of the cast and described in coverage as having grown up in Newark.


The film’s official “Team” page also lists a full slate of crew roles — from cinematography and sound to hair/makeup and production assistants — reflecting a broad regional collaboration behind the camera.
Delaware locations featured on screen
Promotional materials and regional coverage cite multiple Delaware locations used in filming, including:


Hotel du Pont (Wilmington)


The Grand Opera House (Wilmington)


Siegel Jewish Community Center (Siegel JCC)


Captain Blue Hen Comics (Newark)


Precious Paws and Delaware Tire Center


A feature on the Wilmington premiere reported the movie was filmed across 12 Delaware locations, positioning the project as a home-state showcase.
Why Delaware viewers may want to stream it
Delaware rarely sees independent features shot locally at this scale, and the filmmakers have emphasized that local participation — from locations to crew to extras — helped make the project possible.
For audiences, that translates into something personal: a comedy you can watch for laughs, then watch again to recognize places you’ve been — and support a Delaware-made film by clicking “play.”

Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, questions additional funding sought by Kansas Office of Veterans Services after moving from a privately owned structure in Topeka to Landon State Office Building. The issue came up during a House Appropriations Committee meeting on the new state budget. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas House budget committee continued adjusting a bare-bones state government appropriations bill that deleted more than $540 million from agency requests for program enhancements, salary adjustments and hiring new employees.
Subcommittees of the House Appropriations Committee have been meeting since mid-January to make additions or subtractions that would subsequently be considered by the full House and Senate before the finished product went to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. GOP leadership is in a rush to tweak the current 2026 fiscal year budget and pass a budget for fiscal year 2027 before adjourning so incumbents could hit the campaign trail.
Dylan Dear, assistant director for fiscal affairs at the nonpartisan Kansas Legislative Research Department, told members of the committee that an interim House and Senate panel placed the starting point of budget talks in House Bill 2434. In that baseline bill, he said, there was no new money for escalating wages of state employees, hiring personnel or bolstering agency programs. Portions of the proposed budgets — capitol improvements, for example — were left intact.
An array of House subcommittees have started sharing with their peers a collection of ideas for refining the budget draft.
“Some of that money is restored. Some of that money is further deleted. Other adjustments are being made,” Dear said.
No agency or individual sought to testify Monday on the unfinished bill, but subcommittee recommendations did draw attention of legislators.
Rep. David Buehler, a Lansing Republican, said his subcommittee wanted to restore $650,000 for operating expenses of the Kansas Office of Veterans Services that was dropped from the current year’s budget.
In terms of the upcoming budget, Buehler said the subcommittee endorsed a $77,000 increase to cover higher office rent after the Office of Veterans Services moved from a privately owned structure in Topeka into a larger space in the Landon State Office Building.
Rep. Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, said he was puzzled the Office of Veterans Services’ rent costs went up upon relocating to a state-owned building. There has been an unusually high number of agency moves in the past year because of the opening of the rebuilt Docking State Office Building.
“Is the agency growing that fast?” Tarwater said. “That’s a lot of money to spend on a move, plus they have to pay for renovations.”
Rep. Barbara Ballard, D-Lawrence, said it was “kind of weird when you’re charging more when you come to a public building.”
Buehler said the subcommittee didn’t include $162,000 to hire an attorney for the Office of Veterans Services, but Buehler said there was merit to the proposal because the current method of seeking legal counsel was “very clunky.”
“It certainly would seem to be a needed function,” said Buehler, a retired U.S. Navy officer.
Each agency seeking more state funding for personnel ought to report to the Legislature the number of full-time staff, how many job vacancies existed and how long those jobs had been empty, said Rep. Barb Wasinger, R-Hays.
Rep. Avery Anderson, R-Newton, said his subcommittee recommended restoring $1.4 million to a substance abuse program serving people who had been incarcerated. He said the governor’s budget wouldn’t fill the gap in a program offering 18-months of support to reduce recidivism.
“Our committee felt like this is a very important program,” Anderson said. “This is one of those things where we believe the governor supports (it) and intentionally kind of underfunds and expects the Legislature to come in and fund it in full.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Seat-Tarwater-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 16:56:43.498477

A legislator wants to sell “unnecessary” state lands for “homestead clusters” of 10-acre lots to achieve the American Dream. Plus, he says it “might help the habitat.”
The post A Wyoming lawmaker wants to sell state land at $1 per acre for affordable housing appeared first on WyoFile .","A legislator who proposes that Wyoming sell “unnecessary” state-owned land for $1 an acre for affordable housing said his plan for new communities of 10-acre lots might also help wildlife habitat.
Rep. Jacob Wasserburger, a Cheyenne Republican, told WyoFile he doesn’t know how much land might qualify for sale under his House Bill 55 “ Wyoming homestead opportunity program.” He introduced the 19-page bill Thursday.
“Right now I’m still learning where the potential opportunities are,” Wasserburger said. Regarding the acreage that might be available, he said, “I don’t have 100% full certainty how much.”
In addition to providing affordable housing for Wyoming residents, building out instead of up could help the state’s wildlife, he said.
“We keep talking about affordable housing … but, the only [current] solution is subsidized apartment complexes.” Jacob Wasserburger
“I actually think it might help the habitat,” he said, by devoting property to homesteads instead of wind farms and data centers. “That saves the eagles from getting their lungs collapsed,” and he added, saves bats from being struck by turbine blades.
The bill targets Wyoming lands designated as “unnecessary for state needs.” It would exclude acreage dedicated to funding schools and institutions and land used for wildlife refuges, parks, landmarks, historic sites and other public areas.
Wasserburger admitted to getting “quite a beating from the public” and legislators regarding his bill last week. That continued over the weekend.
“This is a terrible idea,” Rep. Mike Yin, a Jackson Democrat, said. Rep. Karlee Provenza, a Laramie Democrat, agreed.
“It’s likely this bill does nothing but continues the narrative that we should sell public lands,” she said. “It’s a foot-in-the-door technique that public land owners must see for what it is — a dishonest attempt to try and take our land.”
Land lottery
The bill would provide $250,000 to the Office of State Lands and Investments to inventory property that would meet Wasserburger’s criteria. Such “homestead clusters” would range from 3,000 to 10,000 acres, containing between 300 to 1,000 lots of 10 acres each, the measure states.
The Office of State Lands and Investments already maintains an online map with codes attached to each parcel showing where revenue from each parcel goes, agency officials said in an email Monday.

“It is unclear exactly how many acres would be eligible for sale if [HB 55] were to pass,” the email reads. “Determining this will take significant detail[ed] study.”
The lots would be sold to Wyoming residents — living in the state for a year — through a lottery and would be reserved for “detached” single-family homes. A person could own a maximum of 25 acres. Businesses and corporations would be barred.
“We keep talking about affordable housing, affordable housing, affordable housing,” Wasserburger said. But, “the only [current] solution is subsidized apartment complexes.”
In such “condensed areas … the crime rate gets to be pretty high,” Wasserburger said. “It’s just not really a healthy way to live, in my opinion.”
In a press release announcing the bill, Wasserburger offered this reasoning behind his measure, referring to himself in the third person.
“While liberal elites want to import the third world and pack everyone into dense high-crime urban areas owned by Wall Street, Wasserburger’s landmark legislation delivers the opposite: families living on affordable acres of land away from big cities,” the release reads. “Radical leftists opened America to the third world which not only drove up housing prices for American families, but also led America into a historic housing deficit.”
Tapping the housing crisis to justify opening publicly owned lands to development is drawing sharp opposition.
“Folks are using the crisis around affordability, the crisis around housing, the crisis around health care, the crisis of groceries, to justify things like tariffs that are illegal, unconstitutional,” Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a New Mexico Democrat, said at a meeting of the House Natural Resources Committee in December. Those people are “justifying opening your public lands and resources … then trying to convince the American people that we’re doing this to help you with the everyday costs that are affecting you.
“It’s just complete f***ing bullshit,” she said.
Out, not up
Rather than having people living in a “built up” vertical environment, “we could have people spread out across land,” Wasserburger said. “People would have the opportunity of the American dream.”
There’s one 640-acre section north of Niobrara County’s Manville, population 95, that could qualify, he said.
The state owns about 3.9 million acres, but only about 16,000 might be unencumbered by leases or other uses and potentially qualify under Waserburger’s criteria, Sen. Mike Gierau, a Jackson Democrat, said. Most of the acreage is leased for grazing, oil and gas development or used for state functions like government, hospitals, prisons, state parks or the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.
Gierau was skeptical the bill could work. 
“There may be 5 acres here, 20 acres there,” he said.
Other institutions and agencies like the University of Wyoming, Department of Transportation, Department of Health and military also own or administer state property, Provenza said.
“This bill is not solving a problem, but certainly is creating many more,” she said.

MAURA HEALEY demanded Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem resign on Monday, following outrage that erupted around the nation this weekend after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.
Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital, was killed Saturday during an encounter with with federal immigration agents amid a surge of Immigration Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol activity in Minnesota. He was the second US citizen fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis this month; Renee Nicole Good was killed earlier during a separate encounter.
Videos of Pretti’s death show a chaotic scuffle with several ICA agents moments before shots were fired.
Healey on Monday escalated her criticism of the administration, calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign, alleging agencies under her purview are “harming public safety.”
“Kristi Noem has got to go. Kristi Noem’s got to go,” she said during a press conference.
“It is just an example of how out of control ICE is,” Healey said. “We have people who are clearly untrained who work for ICE … So my heart goes out to Alex Pretti, to his co-workers, and I really hope Americans take this in and understand the very sad and dangerous moment we’ve reached in this country.”
Healey referenced an internal ICE memo made public last week that directs agents to use force to enter a residence with only an administrative warrant, which are signed by ICE officials and do not require a judge’s approval. 
“That basically said, throw away everything we’ve done for 250 years. Throw away the Fourth Amendment. You have the right to go into someone’s home,” Healey said. “As governor of Massachusetts that infuriates me, because 250 years ago it was a lawyer named James Otis who stood before a court here in the commonwealth and said it is wrong for British soldiers to be able to go into people’s homes without a warrant and ransack their property. That’s what led John Adams to write the Massachusetts Constitution, which said that’s wrong, and people have a right, and that right later appeared in the United States Constitution.”
Federal officials defended the actions of the US Border Patrol agents involved in Pretti’s killing. 
The Department of Homeland Security said agents acted in self-defense. Noem said Pretti “approached” officers with a “9mm semi-automatic handgun” and “reacted violently” when they tried to disarm him, prompting an officer to fire “defensive shots.” White House adviser Stephen Miller escalated the rhetoric, calling Pretti a “a would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement and the official Democrat acount sides with the terrorists.”
Those assertions were sharply rejected by Democratic officials in Massachusetts, many of whom cited the video footage of Pretti holding a cellphone, not a gun, in his hand. They also said Pretti had already been disarmed and was laying on the ground when he was shot. Healey said there were “lies” and “efforts to smear Alex Pretti and who he was” after his killing. 
“With the repulsive murder of Alex Pretti, the Trump Administration has further demonstrated that it views American citizens exercising their Constitutional rights as a threat,” Senate President Karen Spilka said. “It is impossible to overstate how dangerous this is.”
Congressman Bill Keating urged the public to “watch the videos,” and “count the shots” saying, “The statements by Trump officials are false on their face.”
Congressman Jim McGovern said he was “so goddamn angry,” accusing Noem and Miller of trying to portray “the man who was murdered… as somehow a domestic terrorist.”
Congressman Seth Moulton, a Marine veteran, appeared on MSNBC and CNN to discuss the killing. 
On MSNBC, he said, “This is Gestapo type stuff happening in the streets of America.” Asked about Miller’s comments, Moulton replied, “No, Stephen Miller is a domestic terrorist.” 
Moulton also warned that fear is spreading in Massachusetts communities. “Everywhere I go… people are scared. People are really scared, and they’re scared for good reason,” he said, adding that the administration’s actions were intended to “terrorize blue cities across America.”
Congressman Lori Trahan said, “The brutal murders of two American citizens in Minneapolis made clear that the communities ICE enters are less safe than they were before,” and argued that if Trump would not fire Noem, “Congress must step in and remove her.” Congressman Jake Auchincloss said, “Public safety is the first duty of government,” calling ICE “an active threat” and demanding a “thorough investigation.”
US Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey tied Pretti’s killing to the fight over the Department of Homeland Security budget. “Congress must stop the violence by ICE, not bankroll it,” Warren said, arguing that funding for DHS and ICE should be stripped out of a government spending package and debated as a standalone bill. 
Senate Democrats have made clear they will oppose any appropriations legislation that includes DHS funding without significant reforms, a stance that has put pressure on party leaders and raised the prospect of a partial government shutdown when current funding expires at the end of the month. 
Democratic opposition has grown even among senators who previously helped avert a shutdown, with several saying they will vote “no” on the DHS funding bill as it stands, leaving the measure unable to garner the 60 votes needed to proceed in the Senate without changes. 
Markey called Pretti’s killing “a classic example of excessive use of force” and warned that the country was “descending into authoritarianism day by day.”
Outside elected office, advocacy groups also weighed in. 
The Massachusetts Nurses Association condemned what it called the “unwarranted and brutal killing of Alex Pretti,” saying he was gunned down while “engaging in his lawful right to observe and document.”
The Metro Mayors Coalition described the ICE surge as a “militarized invasion” that was eroding community trust and public safety.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump declined to directly say whether the Border Patrol agent who shot Pretti did the right thing, saying, “We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination.”
He added, “I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it,” while criticizing Pretti for attending a protest while armed, adding, “But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.” 
The president also signaled that immigration enforcement officers would leave Minneapolis “at some point” but offered no timeline, and said his administration was considering how to “review everything” about the incident as it unfolds.
At the same time, some Republicans have called for deeper scrutiny. 
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino of New York said his “top priority remains keeping Americans safe.” Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana called the shooting “incredibly disturbing” and said “the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” urging “a full joint federal and state investigation.” Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina called for a “thorough and impartial investigation.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/6977be3a839ed.image_.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 15:57:16.219773

(Photo by Paul Hyde/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A winter storm that blasted the country with freezing temperatures and snow brought power outages, travel delays and some snow to South Carolina over the weekend.
No deaths or serious injuries have been reported in South Carolina from Winter Storm Fern’s freezing temperatures and snow. A state of emergency remained in effect Monday afternoon, and the state had the potential to see freezing temperatures again overnight.
By declaring a state of emergency, Gov. Henry McMaster activated the state’s Emergency Operations Plan and allowed the National Guard to respond as needed. The state’s law against price gouging also went into effect with the emergency declaration.
Power outages
The storm caused power outages, especially throughout the Upstate, as ice accumulated on power lines or brought down tree limbs. Around 30,000 people and businesses across the state were without power as of Monday afternoon.
That included nearly 15,000 outages in Pickens County, 10,000 in Oconee County and 5,000 in Greenville by 3 p.m. Monday, according to Power Outage, a site that tracks outages across states and utilities.

To keep food fresh during power outages, keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible, the state Department of Environmental Services advised.
Anyone using generators to heat their homes during the cold snap should be sure to place them outside and not in the house or a garage. Never use an open oven or gas stove to heat a home, since that comes with high risk of carbon monoxide poisoning and fires, state and federal agencies cautioned.
Other ways of staying warm include bundling up and keeping all members of a household in the same room, with doors to other rooms closed. If temperatures are falling too low, seek shelter elsewhere.
Freezing temperatures and closures
In the Upstate on Monday, which got the brunt of the storm, few trucks and cars could be seen on normally busy streets. Upstate officials said the area had not been hit by an ice storm of this magnitude since 2005.
Small cities were like ghost towns as most businesses remained closed, though some stalwarts like QT stations and Waffle House were open, enjoying a moderate business. Arts events at Greenville’s theaters and the Peace Center were canceled over the weekend.
School districts across the Upstate were closed with plans to remain closed through Tuesday. Monday and Tuesday were classified as “e-learning” days for students at Greenville County Schools, the state’s largest district.
Clemson University and Tri-County Technical College canceled classes Monday. University of South Carolina students had a late start at 11 a.m.

Neither the House nor Senate will return to their chambers until Wednesday, though some House committee meetings are still scheduled for Tuesday.
Law enforcement throughout the Upstate and Midlands urged residents to stay home over the weekend, with some warnings continuing into Monday. Even if rain or snow is not actively falling, roads can remain slick with ice, officials warned.
On Sunday, with a break in the icy rain, some Upstate residents took the opportunity to enjoy some sledding in ice-covered parks and on school grounds. The area got 1 1/2 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service — more than a typical January day but less than the record for that day in 1923, which is 2.3 inches.
The highest two-day snowfall ever recorded in South Carolina occurred in February 1969, when nearly 29 inches fell in Caesars Head State Park in Greenville County, according to the state climatology office. Several years later, in 1973, Rimini in Clarendon County saw 2 feet of snow. More recently, Winthrop University recorded snowbanks of just over 17 inches in February 2004.
In the Midlands on Saturday night and into Sunday, Icy rain left a sheet of frost, making roads slick. Temperatures climbed Sunday night and into Monday, melting ice into puddles by Monday afternoon.
Any stray snowflakes in the Midlands air did not accumulate enough to calculate a snowfall amount, according to the National Weather Service.
Temperatures along the coast hovered around freezing throughout the weekend. Charleston stayed above a comparatively balmy low of 32 degrees Sunday, while the Grand Strand’s temperatures fell as low as 28 degrees.
Travel impacts
The state Department of Transportation urged drivers to remain cautious Monday. Crews are working to clear interstates and busy thoroughfares from snow and ice, as well as downed tree limbs. Highways, ramps and bridges get top priority because they ice over more quickly than other roads, according to the agency.

Travelers felt the lingering effects of the storm Monday, as airports across the state canceled or delayed both arriving and departing flights, especially to states that got hit with heavier snow and ice.
At Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport, all departures were canceled on
Sunday. Many arriving or departing flights were canceled Monday as well.
Every flight out of Charleston International Airport on Monday morning was canceled or delayed, though some afternoon flights started to take off on time. The same was the case at Columbia Metropolitan Airport.
What’s coming?
Much of the state will be under a cold weather advisory Monday night into Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service.
Those in the Upstate should expect temperatures as low as 11 degrees overnight, with an advisory running from 6 p.m. Monday to noon Tuesday. Columbia could get down to 14 degrees, and coastal residents could experience temperatures in the 20s, according to weather service forecasts.
Warming stations for those without power or a place to stay opened throughout the Upstate and Midlands. More information about Department of Emergency Management shelters is available by visiting the agency’s website.
Shelters for those who rely on medical equipment requiring power are available upon request by calling (833) 351-9990.



Cold weather advisories

Columbia: 10 p.m. Monday to 10 a.m. Tuesday, with a low of 14 degrees
Charleston: 10 p.m. Monday to 9 a.m. Tuesday, with a low of 26 degrees

(Photo courtesy Cordelia Kellie) In Washington, D.C., politicians are debating U.S. annexation of Greenland based on abstract ideas like “defense,” “security,” and “critical minerals.”
In Alaska, the issue is personal.
The state’s ties with Greenland go back centuries, to when the ancestors of the island’s Indigenous residents migrated east from Western Alaska.
Today, many Alaskans count Greenlanders as friends, colleagues or kin who speak a closely related language and participate in similar cultural traditions — and some Alaskans are now calling for solidarity against the actions threatened by their own president.
“We are witnessing, on a world stage, harm against our family,” said Ayyu Qassataq, an Anchorage-based Iñupiaq and Yup’ik advocate.
It is “disturbing on a visceral level,” she added.
Alaska’s connections to Greenland extend beyond cultural relations.
Alaskan scientists work alongside Greenlanders, studying oceans, glaciers, and climate change, and policymakers from both places have sat beside each other at international forums like the Arctic Council. The president’s rhetoric, some critics say, could strain those relationships, along with U.S. geopolitical alliances.
But Trump’s comments are provoking particularly intense feelings of anxiety and concern among some of Alaska’s Indigenous communities.
Greenland, an autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark, is home to some 57,000 people, most of whom are Inuit and whose ancestors came from Alaska about 1,000 years ago.
Today, Greenlanders and Alaska’s Iñupiat speak languages with the same roots and carry on many of the same traditions in music, art and food. Both peoples are Inuit — a broader group that encompasses Indigenous residents of multiple Arctic regions.

“We are essentially the same people that just speak different dialects of the same language,” said Tim Argetsinger, who’s Iñupiaq from Northwest Alaska and currently lives in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital.
Argetsinger told Northern Journal that some Greenlanders are selling their homes and moving off the island because they’re afraid and uncertain about their future.
“The sense of fear and anxiety is very palpable,” he said.
As Trump’s threats have escalated in the past week, Inuit leaders in Alaska have made increasingly passionate pleas of support for Greenlanders, who overwhelmingly oppose American annexation.
Alaska’s branch of the Inuit Circumpolar Council — a transnational body representing Indigenous people in Alaska, Russia, Canada and Greenland — released a rare political statement this week. It affirmed the council’s “support and solidarity” with Greenlanders and called on the U.S. to “respect and uphold international law and rules-based order that honors diplomacy and Inuit rights.”
“We stand united with our Greenlandic relatives,” said Marie Greene, an Iñupiaq elder from the Northwest Alaska village of Deering who’s the president of ICC’s Alaska arm.
Others, like Qassataq, have shared videos on social media expressing support alongside Inuit from Alaska and Canada.
Qassataq, who runs a consulting business, Qulliq Munaqtuġuut, that promotes Indigenous self-determination and well-being, has traveled to Greenland multiple times over the past year to work on Inuit healing and advocacy efforts and to teach courses on Inuit culture at Ilisimatusarfik, Greenland’s university.
Like many Alaskans, she has good friends there and has been in close contact with them over the past week, she said.
Greenlanders are “having very real conversations” not only about the island’s political future but also their personal safety, in light of Trump’s militaristic rhetoric, Qassataq said.
“Because we care so much for them, we feel deeply what they’re experiencing and what their fears are,” she said. “Though we are separated by hundreds of years, false borders and different colonial influences, they are our family.”
Qassataq and other Alaskans said in recent interviews that they grew up hearing about Greenland from relatives and Inuit leaders.
Cordelia Qiġñaaq Kellie, who’s Iñupiaq and lives in Anchorage, said the topic of Greenland would come up frequently in conversations well before Trump’s threats, indicating the long-standing connections between Alaskans and Greenlanders.
“Oftentimes, if I mention Greenland, friends and community members will respond with, ‘Oh, when I was in Greenland…,’ beyond those I was aware had ever been there,” she said.  “Sometimes people joke that we need to go to Greenland to learn our language because it’s so similar.”
Along with a few other Alaskans, Kellie went to Nuuk last year as part of an Inuit Circumpolar Council policy workshop for young Inuit leaders.  She has kept up her friendships with some of the Greenlanders that she met there. One recently visited Anchorage. She’s been checking in on others.
“It was like Inuit summer camp,” Kellie said of the workshop.
In Nuuk, she experienced being in a “majority-Inuit society” for the first time, she said.

“Oftentimes, we can think of Alaskan Inuit rural hubs in a cloistered context,” she said. “But imagine if the United States had been replaced with all Inuit people.”
“You go to a sushi restaurant, and they have beluga sushi,” Kellie added. It tastes “just like beluga from home.”

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Eleven people, including a former prison food service contract worker, inmates alleged to be gang members and non-inmates have been indicted in Bon Homme County on a host of drug-related charges tied to a November overdose death at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield.
South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley announced the charges at a Monday press conference in Pierre. The charges flow from an inquiry led by the state Division of Criminal Investigation into the November death of inmate Timothy Tyree, one of eight men who died of drug overdoses in the state’s prisons last year.
‘Moral leadership’ needed to stop South Dakota prison overdose deaths, inmates and activists say

All but one of those deaths has been linked to K2, a synthetic drug typically sprayed on paper and smoked. To the naked eye, paper soaked in K2 is indistinguishable from untainted paper.
In addition to the charges, investigators seized three sheets of K2 with 61 stamp-sized doses, said Jackley. The day Tyree was found unresponsive, Jackley said, “numerous individuals” at Durfee were “sick from K2.” 
Last year, Jackley’s office charged inmates, a former correctional officer and others outside the prison walls in connection with other overdose deaths at the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls and the penitentiary’s Jameson Annex. 
“I think we’re slowing it down,” he said of drug trafficking in the state’s prisons.
The distribution ring in Springfield that was broken up in the current investigation hinged on the alleged cooperation of a now-former contract worker in the Durfee kitchen. People outside the prison would deliver the K2 to her, Jackley explained, and she would hand it off to inmates inside the prison for distribution from there.
The most serious charge faced by the 11 is distribution of controlled substances resulting in death. Each person was indicted on that charge, which carries a penalty of up to 25 years in prison.
Two of the inmates indicted in the Tyree case have detainment orders from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Jackley said, meaning they’d have been handed off to ICE upon parole. 
Jackley said his office intends to pursue the state-level charges in the indictments, but he would defer to the federal agency on what happens when the parole dates arrive later this year.
“To the extent it makes more sense to have ICE take further action, I will be supportive of that and will work with them on those decisions,” Jackley said.

Oct. 22, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Before Michigan ever sees federal officers flood our streets, before another video shocks the conscience, the warning signs are already here — and they are coming from inside our own state government.
As Michigan Advance reported last week, a group of Michigan House Republicans has now openly threatened the funding of state courts if the Michigan Supreme Court adopts a rule that would have the effect of limiting most immigration arrests in courthouses.
In other words, lawmakers are signaling that judicial independence itself is conditional and that courts will be punished for attempting to protect basic access to justice.
This is not a side issue. It is the canary in the coal mine.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Courts are where people go to comply with the law. Threatening to turn those spaces into traps, or to defund them for refusing to do so, is not about public safety or “law and order.” It is about coercion. And it tells us exactly how unprepared Michigan Republicans are to meet a moment when federal power is increasingly exercised without restraint.
That context matters, because the apparent murder of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis should end any lingering illusion that what is happening elsewhere cannot happen here. Video evidence shows Pretti stepping in to help two women who were being maced by federal immigration officers. For that act, he was set upon by officers, beaten and disarmed of a weapon he was legally licensed to carry. All evidence indicates he never brandished that gun, but at least one federal agent shot him to death.
Whatever euphemisms are offered in the days ahead, what the public saw was not restraint. It was escalation. And it should force a reckoning well beyond Minneapolis.

Michigan must be ready to respond to a similar surge by the Trump administration here. 
Ready does not mean issuing statements after the fact. Ready means our leaders deciding now where they will stand, and what they will do, when federal power arrives without restraint and demands compliance.
The hardest question for our leaders is also the most personal: Are we prepared, like Alex Pretti, to place their bodies between what has clearly become an unrestrained mob and our fellow citizens?
That question isn’t rhetorical. It’s a measure of civic courage, and it does not apply only to people in the street. It applies to those in office, those with badges, and those with microphones.
This is where the threat to court funding becomes impossible to ignore. When Michigan Republicans threaten to kneecap the judiciary for resisting ICE arrests in courthouses, they are not merely posturing. They are laying the groundwork for complacency. They are signaling that when federal abuses come, they will not defend the institutions meant to check them — they will discipline those institutions instead.
This from the same crowd that incessantly intones that immigrants must “follow the law” and “come here the right way.” Arresting people in courtrooms, a place they have come specifically to follow the law, exposes the lie at the heart of the so-called law and order movement.
If compliance becomes the danger, then law and order has nothing to do with justice and everything to do with intimidation.
But this moment does not give Democrats an automatic pass. Opposition cannot be selective or symbolic. Sen. Elissa Slotkin has said she will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security when the issue comes up later this week. That is good to hear. It shows awareness of the stakes. But it must be the starting point, not the entirety of the response.
Michigan faces a choice. We can tell ourselves the killing of Alex Pretti was an aberration, or we can acknowledge the reality in front of us: federal power escalating without restraint, and political leaders here seemingly preparing to excuse it.
Threatening to defund the courts is not a warning sign — it is the decision itself.
Michigan’s leaders will either defend the rule of law before it is broken here, or they will help normalize its collapse.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tony Evers announced Monday that Wisconsin has signed on to an effort to support the state of Minnesota’s lawsuit seeking to challenge the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents in the Twin Cities area. 
Minnesota filed its lawsuit after the federal government sent about 3,000 federal agents into the region and an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good Jan. 7. On Saturday, agents shot and killed Alex Pretti. Minnesota is seeking a temporary restraining order against the federal government’s actions.
Late last week, Wisconsin joined Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, District Of Columbia, Delaware, Hawai‘i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington in filing an amicus brief supporting Minnesota’s case. 
“DHS has set in motion an extraordinary campaign of recklessness and disregard for norms of constitutional policing and the sanctity of life,” the brief states. “This has resulted in federal agents that have fatally shot one resident, seriously wounded others, tear gassed an infant and other children, attacked peaceful protestors, and systematically conducted illegal stops and arrests. When tragedy has struck and public outcry rung out, the response has been a promise to deliver more of the same. Indeed, just days ago, President Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, and it is reported that the Pentagon is preparing 1,500 troops to possibly deploy to Minnesota, reflecting the Administration’s desire to further escalate tensions and put the military into an unlawful domestic role.” 
The brief argues that the states have a “strong interest in ensuring that federal immigration enforcement is not used as an excuse to infringe the sovereignty of the States,” and that if allowed to continue unchecked in Minnesota, will likely repeat the pattern elsewhere. 
“Under the claimed auspices of carrying out immigration enforcement, the federal government has seriously undermined state and local authorities and made it impossible for the public to go about their day-to-day activities because they fear being stopped, tear gassed, or worse,” the brief states. “If left unchecked, the federal government will no doubt be emboldened to continue its unlawful conduct in Minnesota and to repeat it elsewhere.” 
Evers said in a statement that Wisconsin has a responsibility to stand up for its neighbor and work to prevent further damage. 
“Wisconsin stands with our neighbors across the river in Minnesota. American citizens are having their rights and freedoms violated and are being put in unsafe and life-threatening situations in their own communities,” Evers said. “Two have already lost their lives. It has to stop.” 
“In Minnesota and across our country, dangerous and unlawful actions at the hands of untrained individuals are sowing fear, division, and distrust,” Evers added. “This isn’t helping make our kids, families, and communities safer—in fact, it’s doing the opposite. It’s clearer than ever that this has nothing to do with public safety. And, as states, we have a responsibility to stand up and say no more.”

Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), March 14, 2023 | Laina G. StebbinsU.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten, who flipped what was once considered a Republican stronghold during the 2022 election, has given her support to state Democratic state Sen. Sean McCann of Kalamazoo in his push to unseat U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland Township).
McCann, who was first elected to the Legislature in 2010, announced he would be running for the 4th Congressional District last July. Looking toward the August primary, McCann is running against Diop Harris, a former congressional staffer. However, with endorsements from Scholten, alongside Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Democratic former U.S. Rep. Mark Schauer, McCann has secured his spot as an early favorite for Democrats.
“As the first Democrat to hold my Congressional seat in almost 100 years, I know what it takes to earn trust here, win tough races, and deliver for families and small businesses. And I know Sean has what it takes to win and serve in Congress too. That’s why I’m so proud to endorse him for Michigan’s Fourth Congressional District,” Scholten, a Grand Rapids Democrat, said in a statement. “We’re building something new in West Michigan. The work we started will continue when more serious, accountable leaders who are deeply rooted in our communities step up and serve. Sean is exactly that kind of proven leader.”

According to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, Michigan’s 4th Congressional District leans “Likely Republican,” though the seat is a key target for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, U.S. House Democrat’s official campaign arm.
Huizenga was first elected to Congress in Michigan’s 2nd Congressional district in 2011, however, redistricting placed Huizenga in Michigan’s 4th Congressional, which includes all of Allegan and Van Buren Counties as well as parts of Berrien, Calhoun, Kalamazoo and Ottawa Counties.
“Congresswoman Scholten knows there’s more that unites us than divides us and that it is critical that we put people above partisanship,” McCann said. “She has always shown up and delivered results for West Michigan. I’m so grateful to have her support, and look forward to joining her in Congress to fight for the 4th district to deliver lower costs and expand health care access.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSC_0575_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 15:57:16.219773

The two have lived in a tent in Milford for months, and as temperatures plummeted Friday ahead of a storm that dropped a foot of snow on the town, they packed to go to a motel for the weekend. But questions remained. What would they do with their tent? Would the place that had been home for months withstand the whipping winds? If they packed everything up, would they be able to find a dry spot, get the stakes back into frozen ground?
They were just a couple of the dozens of people experiencing homelessness in Milford — and among many more around the state — who had to scramble to find a place to stay through the weekend’s winter storm.
“It’s just not a normal thing,” DeLorenzo said. “You’ve got to stay bundled up, whether you’re under the covers or not. It’s cold.”
“And then sometimes you have three layers of clothes, you’re not comfortable. Sometimes sleeping like that is a pain,” Mancini added. “But we get through it.”
Beth-El Center, a Milford nonprofit, planned to put about 20 people living outside or in their cars up in motels for the weekend and early part of the week. Another 40 would sleep on cots at the shelter, and 20 more would stay in overflow spots at local churches, said Hannah Smith, the organization’s director of shelter services.

Homelessness — particularly unsheltered homelessness — has been increasing in Connecticut in recent years. The population of people living outside, in their cars or in other places not meant for human habitation rose by 45% from 2024 to 2025. An annual count, which takes place in January each year, showed that 800 people were unsheltered on that night last year.
Connecticut homeless service providers for years have said they need more resources to meet the need of the unhoused population. This need becomes particularly acute, they say, in instances of extreme weather. Across the country, at least 12 people died because of the cold weather over the weekend, according to national news media.
Key lawmakers have said they want to focus on addressing homelessness in the legislative session that begins next month. Last session, a bipartisan group of legislators formed the new Homelessness Caucus to advocate for more solutions and aid for the unhoused population.

Mancini and DeLorenzo became homeless for the first time after an eviction in 2020. They’ve since rented rooms in other people’s houses, but always ran into problems with roommates who didn’t pay the rent or utility bills.
They met in middle school and interact with the ease of a longtime couple. He helps her put on her backpack as they leave their tent and head over to the Beth-El shelter. She is almost always smiling and helps him keep his spirits up, he said.
Their site is clean, devoid of trash. They’re diligent about cleaning up and keeping the elements outside their tent. The storm posed problems.
Jason Blakeman, an outreach worker, tried to convince them to pack up their tent and all their belongings but DeLorenzo resisted, worried that they wouldn’t be able to put the tent back up in their old spot. They like their spot. It’s quiet.
During the last storm, DeLorenzo said, they had to hold the tent up to keep it from collapsing in the wind. He planned to come out every couple of hours to sweep snow off the top.
The two hope to move into an apartment soon. Just a few days ago, Mancini got approved for the Housing Empowering Recovery from Opioids (HERO) program through the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The program aims to help people achieve sobriety through stabilizing their housing. Mancini has been in her current sobriety program for nearly a year.
They’re excited for regular date nights, for time to focus on romance rather than survival. “I’m excited to get our old life back,” DeLorenzo said.

For Brian Liberatore, who lives in a wooded area of Milford, “survival is a full-time job.” He has a campsite complete with a tent, tools covered with a tarp and a cook stove. He’s in culinary school at Gateway Community College and likes to practice on the propane stove.
His tent is coming apart at the seams after a December snowstorm ripped through the fabric. In preparation for this weekend’s storm, he’d clamped the edges together and tied the tent to nearby trees. He, like DeLorenzo, planned to hike through the storm from his motel room every couple of hours to sweep snow off his home.
Liberatore is familiar with the unsheltered community and has an extra tent he’s let people stay in before, notably a man who was recovering after heart surgery and had been discharged from the hospital back into homelessness.
“These are people that have had lives,” he said. “They’ve had families, children, and they deserve the respect and basic humanity, and compassion.”
Liberatore keeps a guitar at his campsite where he said he likes to play all kinds of music. He got a guitar for his now-12-year-old grandson a few years ago. He prefers the freedom of living outside to a shelter, but wishes he had a place to stay.
“I would rather not live in a shelter because I have freedom, no neighbors, no rules. But the weather has just gotten a little too much,” Liberatore said. “You’re good until you’re not good.”

Extreme weather is just one of the circumstances that can reveal the fragility of unsheltered homelessness. Blakeman and Smith on Friday visited an old campsite where a group of people had built tiny homes in the woods, complete with running water, a garden and an outdoor bar. They’d listen to music at night and established rules and chores for everyone living there.
A fire broke out in August, displacing everyone who lived there and killing one man, Joseph Kane. Now, rosaries hang on the remains of Kane’s home. Blakeman said he waited while first responders retrieved Kane’s body from the wreckage.
“I wanted him to have someone here who cared about him,” Blakeman said, through tears.

He and Smith spent much of the day Friday visiting people who lived outside and ensuring they knew where to go and when. They arranged Ubers to take individuals, ensured they had enough space to pack up their belongings and even to transport pets. They got people gift cards to buy enough food to wait out the storm.
For Bonnie Rossignol, who has seen someone’s tent flattened because it was too close to the path of a snow plow, the news that she’d be able to stay in a motel paid for by the provider didn’t arrive until late Friday afternoon. Rossignol said she’d set up an awning in the front of her tent to try to keep the snow away from the front door.
“When the snow comes down, it just pushes down on that awning,” she said. “But if that awning collapses, there goes the whole front of my tent and everything inside of it is, boom.” She smashed her hands together. 
Blakeman had an extra tarp for her. He and Smith arranged an Uber to pick her up at 4:45 p.m. She promised to be at the meeting spot and packed by then. 
But, for them, the work was just beginning. The snowstorm dropped more than a foot of snow across the state and temperatures are expected to stay below freezing for days.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0123_SR_HomelessStorm_015-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 15:57:16.219773

Now, further transformation of the city’s once-blighted Lower Broadway district will be overseen by newly elected mayor Robert Van Campen, who was inaugurated on January 5.","DEVELOPMENT IS A promising word in Gateway Cities, and Everett’s new mayor just inherited a lot of it in his first few weeks in office. Agreements for two major projects – a $500 million soccer stadium and two new hotels across from the Encore Boston Harbor casino – were announced just as former mayor Carlo DeMaria was leaving office earlier this month. Another massive mixed-use development that will include manufacturing, office, and retail space is already the works.  
It’s all part of DeMaria’s 18-year legacy, during which he ushered in a development boom anchored by the city’s welcoming of the commonwealth’s biggest casino. But in November, voters decided that the swaggering mayor’s work in Everett was finished after a series of scandals, including an investigation that found DeMaria had intentionally concealed “longevity” bonuses that were improperly paid to him.  
Few cities have experienced the kind of growth Everett has seen in the last seven years. Now, further transformation of the city’s once-blighted Lower Broadway district will be overseen by newly elected mayor Robert Van Campen, who was inaugurated on January 5.

“I refer to it as a case study for urban renewal,” he said in an interview. “It is quite an honor for me to come into office at a time when I have the ability to make sure this is all implemented properly.”  
On his last day in office, DeMaria announced that he had finally struck a deal with Wynn Resorts – the operator of Encore Boston Harbor – allowing two hotels to be built across the street from the casino after years of discussion. The agreement requires Wynn to pay up to $25 million for the construction of a new, long-sought commuter rail stop along the Newburyport/Rockport line. 
Wynn also committed $15 million for other transportation and infrastructure improvements in the area, including expanded bus lines, bike lanes, and a pedestrian bridge that will allow people to safely cross Route 99. The new hotels are expected to total up to 800 rooms and will be built on land currently owned by Wynn by as early as 2028, though the plans still need to be reviewed by the Everett Planning Board.  
“We look forward to partnering with Mayor Van Campen on the many details to be worked through on our recent agreement and making Everett and Encore even more successful,” Wynn said in a statement.  
During his campaign, Van Campen vowed to approach development differently, saying that overdevelopment had “strangled” Everett neighborhoods in recent years.  
“The difference between the mayor and me is that I have a more focused view to ensure that the developers aren’t dictating these projects, and that the people of Everett are the ones in the driver’s seat,” Van Campen said in a November interview with CommonWealth Beacon. 
But the new mayor mostly expressed content with DeMaria’s last-minute agreement with Wynn, saying the infrastructure commitments, increased city revenue, and anticipated job creation will be good for the community.  
“There are positives to this deal. There’s no question about that,” Van Campen said. “But the question is now going to be implementation.”  
Van Campen said he will ensure the people of Everett “have their voice heard” when the city outlines the hard details of the project. He also wants to ensure that the benefits of development are felt not only in South Everett, but in Everett Square, Glendale Square, and in the city’s neighborhoods, adding that he hopes residents will eventually see increases in the value of their homes. 
The real estate is expected to generate approximately $12 million in annual revenue for the city and will be constructed under a collective bargaining agreement. Wynn could not yet provide estimated cost details for the two hotel projects, which will not include any gambling activities.

Less than a week before the hotel development deal was announced, DeMaria, in his final act, also landed a community impact agreement with the Kraft Group, allowing the construction of a widely discussed New England Revolution soccer stadium to move forward.  
Under the 20-year agreement, the city is expected to receive nearly $92 million through direct payments, infrastructure additions and upgrades, and other community investments. The city will receive $2.25 for every ticket sold. The Kraft Group also committed $100 million for environmental mitigation and cleanup at the contaminated former power plant site where the stadium will be built. The 25,000-seat stadium will be made available for public school and youth athletic events. 
In a November interview, Van Campen said he wants to drill down on the potential impacts the stadium will have on both vehicle and pedestrian traffic.  
A mixed-use development project led by development firm The Davis Companies is also scheduled to take over a former ExxonMobil fuel storage facility in Everett. The new site will include an energy storage facility, as well as industrial and manufacturing space, lab and office space, retail space, and thousands of residential units.  
The massive projects will further transform Everett’s blighted industrial land and keep DeMaria’s vision for a growing entertainment district alive.

Van Campen said he wants to continue attracting investment in the Lower Broadway corridor. In the future, he plans to recruit a developer to build a new boys and girls club in the area.  
“[DeMaria] does leave behind a legacy of transformation in this community, which he should be proud of and I think the community is grateful for,” Van Campen said. “But now it’s time to write a new chapter.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/00000CarloDeMaria.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 15:57:16.219773

One of America’s last battleships, USS Wisconsin, is moored on the Elizabeth River in Norfolk, Virginia.
Now a floating museum, the ship’s most recent battle was winning Good Morning America’s Great Christmas Light Fight this past holiday season.
USS Wisconsin was still decked out in lights when David Woods recently gave a tour of the historic ship. A retired warrant officer, Woods spent 30 years in naval aviation, often working on aircraft carriers.
He said the Wisconsin – one of four Iowa-Class battleships that entered service in the final months of World War II – is still intact enough that it can technically be recalled back into service.
“The little stipulation we have with the Navy: There’s certain things we can’t do to the ship as a museum, because they have to be able to take the ship back and undo everything we did within like two or three weeks,” Woods said.
USS Wisconsin came into service in 1944. It was revived briefly during the Reagan defense buildup in the 1980s, then decommissioned again in the early 1990s after its 16 inch guns were used for shore bombardment in the first Gulf War.
Its 13 inch steel hull is thick enough to withstand a modern tomahawk cruise missile. But operating it would cost nearly $1 million a day just in fuel. With its dials and analog firing systems, the ship would also require a complete retrofit.
Woods said the Wisconsin and other battleships of its era are probably no longer the ships the Navy needs.
“I would volunteer to come out of retirement in a heartbeat to serve on one of them,” he said. “But in modern warfare and feasibility-wise, they’re just obsolete, unfortunately.”
Battleships haven’t been part of the Navy’s arsenal since the World War II era ships were finally retired. The Navy now relies mainly on smaller, more versatile destroyers.
“Today’s ships have to be multi-functional,” Woods said. “A battleship is a bowie knife; a destroyer is a Swiss army knife.”
President Donald Trump announced plans in December to revive the battleship concept and build as many as 20 – 25 new battleships as part of what he’s calling the “Golden Fleet.”
Following Trump’s announcement, the Navy put on hold its plans for a new, more powerful destroyer. Instead, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Daryl Caudle embraced Trump’s vision.
“Battleships will anchor maritime fires and sea control in the most contested environments, massing durable combat power and absorbing punishment and adversary cannot match,” Caudle said in January at the Annual Surface Navy Association National Symposium in Arlington, Virginia.
During the conference, the Congressional Budget Office released an estimate that the first ship could cost as much as $22 billion, while follow ups could cost between $10 to $15 billion.
That would rival the cost of the larger Ford-Class aircraft carriers. USS Gerald F. Ford cost roughly $13 billion after cost overruns and delays.
The design concept of the new ship, which was unveiled during a Trump press conference, has been pulled from the Internet. But the battleship was more than double the length of current destroyers and needed almost three times the crew. It included a number of weapons systems that aren’t in production.

Bryan Clark, a senior fellow with the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, expressed concern about the design’s complexity.
He noted it’s one thing to say the Navy needs a larger ship which could launch more missiles.
“It’s another thing to say, ‘I need to have a laser on it, I need to have a rail gun on it, and other systems that don’t exist yet and that are going to be too complex to introduce all into one platform without creating a massive increase in cost and schedule,'” he said.
In 2021, the Navy dropped plans for railguns, which fire metal bolts rather than shells, when the program failed to produce a consistently working model.
The Navy has a history of stopping ship production when delays pile up and costs get out of hand. It ended the Zumwalt class of destroyer after three ships. And the Trump Administration just ended production of the Constellation class frigate after the first two ships.
A new battleship could be the costliest U-turn in Navy history.
“If they end up abandoning it, now you’ve got these orphan ships that have a lot of unique capabilities that will be difficult to maintain on that small scale,” Clark said.
Ultimately, Congress will have a say on whether the battleships are built. Even if lawmakers approve the plan, the U.S. won’t roll out its first battleship since 1944 for at least a decade, Clark said.

Gov. Bob Ferguson said he could envision members of the National Guard acting as a buffer between immigration officers and protesters. Attorney General Nick Brown didn’t rule out the possibility of state or local authorities stepping in to enforce state law against federal agents.
And both Ferguson and Brown urged residents to monitor and record questionable immigration enforcement conduct.
After immigration agents in Minnesota shot and killed a man over the weekend, Ferguson issued a statement saying that the nation’s “descent into authoritarian rule continues” and calling on people to “defend your democracy while you still can.”
On Monday, he hosted a press conference alongside Brown at the Capitol to lay out the state’s preparations for the possibility of a ramped-up deployment of immigration agents in the state. 
It came two days after federal agents killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday, escalating already high tensions over intensifying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations across the country under the Trump administration. 
“Our job, my job, attorney general’s job, all of our jobs here, is to make sure that we are doing everything we can to prepare for a worst-case scenario,” said Ferguson.
The first-term Democrat said ICE was “completely and totally out of control.” 
The governor said he met Sunday with Adjutant General Gent Welsh, who leads the state’s National Guard, to discuss related issues, but didn’t offer details. As of Monday, Ferguson said he had “no specific information” that an immigration crackdown in Washington is forthcoming.
Brown called the Trump administration a “little cabal of cruelty.”

“America is weaker because of the operations in Minnesota, and real people all across this country are now traumatized, injured and dead because of this president’s fascist tendencies,” said Brown, also a Democrat and former federal prosecutor.
He acknowledged the state was on the cusp of messy territory when it comes to issues like state or local officers intervening in federal immigration operations.
“It’s obviously incredibly complicated when you’re talking about the division of authority between state law enforcement, local and the federal government,” Brown said. “As a general matter, state and local law enforcement do not have to simply watch or look away if the law is being violated.”
‘Everybody has a role’
Democrats around the country are slamming ICE over its conduct. And, following Pretti’s death, there’s a possibility that Senate Democrats will withhold needed votes on federal funding legislation, a move that could trigger a partial government shutdown. 
In the Washington Legislature, Democratic lawmakers are considering a slew of measures in response to the heightened immigration enforcement campaign. 
These include a ban on police face coverings, as many ICE agents have covered their faces during operations, protections for immigrant workers from federal raids and guardrails for the use of automated license plate readers that authorities have used to track down immigrants.
Even some Republicans, who are generally wary of criticizing the president, are raising concerns.
A group of governors on Sunday, including the Republican chief executive of Oklahoma who chairs the National Governors Association, called for a “reset” from the federal government on its immigration enforcement campaign.
And U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner, a Republican from eastern Washington, called for congressional hearings into immigration enforcement after Pretti’s shooting, which he called “disturbing.”
Ferguson and Brown also emphasized the role the public has in “defending our democracy.”
“We have certain powers as attorney general or governors to do our part, but everybody has a role in our state right now,” Ferguson said. “And we’re going to need that to get through this.”
They said if Washington were faced with a broad ICE incursion, they would pursue legal avenues to stop it, as officials in Minnesota have. 
But state leaders here can’t keep ICE out of the state, Ferguson noted. And he and Brown encouraged residents to record interactions with federal agents. Videos of the shootings of Pretti and Renee Good in Minnesota have captured the circumstances leading up to their deaths.
King County and the cities of Seattle and Shoreline, along with local elected officials in Bellingham and Tacoma, signed onto a legal brief last week arguing the Minneapolis crackdown is unconstitutional.
A federal judge is considering halting the 3,000-agent deployment. 
Letter to Noem
Ferguson and Brown on Monday sent a letter to U.S. Homeland Security Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees ICE, urging her to withdraw federal agents from Minnesota: “Now is the time to deescalate.”
They also took issue with an internal memo arguing ICE agents can enter people’s homes without a judicial warrant, despite vast legal precedent to the contrary. 
“If ICE agents attempt any such unconstitutional measures in the state of Washington, we will do everything in our power to oppose it,” Ferguson and Brown wrote in their letter. “Our state will consider all legal options to hold the U.S. Government and individual ICE agents accountable for violating Washingtonians’ constitutional rights.”

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin is set to leave her post at the end of this school year to become the president of Columbia University in New York. 
Mnookin has served as UW-Madison’s chancellor since 2022, leading the university as it has faced pressure from Wisconsin Republicans to end diversity programs as well as cuts to federal research grants and tensions surrounding a pro-Palestine encampment on campus. 
“It has been a true honor to be a part of the Wisconsin family,” Mnookin said in a statement Sunday. “I am proud of what we have accomplished together, even in a challenging period for higher education, and I know great possibilities lie ahead for the UW-Madison campus community.”
After her departure was announced, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) praised Mnookin’s tenure. 
“Chancellor Mnookin had many great accomplishments during her tenure, such as bringing more free speech to campus and closing its division of DEI,” Vos said in a statement. “I enjoyed working with her as we both wanted students to reach their full potential and have a successful and impactful life after graduation. I wish her nothing but the best and I know that Columbia University will be in great hands with her at the helm.”
Mnookin will be taking over at Columbia as the university has been under a national microscope following pro-Palestine protests and a crackdown by both campus officials and the Trump administration. Last year, Columbia agreed to pay the federal government about $200 million to restore federal funding that had been cut. 
Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman will name an interim chancellor to take the role after Mnookin leaves following spring commencement. The UW system board of regents will launch a search for someone to fill the role permanently. 
“During her tenure, Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin brought unbounded energy, resilience, and deeply thoughtful leadership to this great university. As she now takes on a new opportunity at another prestigious institution, we extend our substantial gratitude for her service and wish her continued success in the years ahead,” Rothman said.

Update on State of Emergency, Snowfall totals, Power Outages, Schools, and more. 
WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware began shifting from emergency response to recovery Monday after Winter Storm Fern delivered measurable snow across the state, left scattered power outages, and triggered road restrictions and widespread school closures.
Gov. Matthew Meyer terminated Delaware’s state of emergency at 3 p.m. Monday, Jan. 26, a move that also released Delaware National Guard assets, state officials said. But Level 1 driving warnings remained in place for New Castle and Kent counties, urging motorists to avoid travel unless necessary and to use extreme caution, especially on secondary roads where icy conditions may persist.
Snowfall totals: Wilmington saw 6.5 inches; Sussex totals varied
Final snowfall reports compiled by the National Weather Service showed 6.5 inches in Wilmington, with higher totals reported nearby — including 9 inches just east-northeast of Wilmington and 7.8 inches in Hockessin.
In Sussex County, totals varied sharply by location. Spotters reported 4 inches in Milton and Selbyville, while reports around Georgetown and the Seaford area were closer to 1.5 inches in earlier storm totals. The National Weather Service report did not list a storm-total measurement specifically for Milford.
Power outages improved through the day
Statewide outage tracking showed about 1,415 customers without power earlier Monday, with Kent County reporting the largest share of outages in that snapshot.
By late afternoon, conditions appeared to have improved significantly: PowerOutage.us showed 1 customer without power statewide, with outages concentrated in New Castle County.
Driving restrictions downgraded; Sussex warning lifted
As conditions evolved, the state also eased travel restrictions. Delaware officials announced that, effective 10 a.m. Monday, New Castle and Kent were downgraded from a Level 2 driving restriction to a Level 1 driving warning, and the Level 1 warning in Sussex County was lifted.
Even with the downgrade, officials warned that black ice and prolonged subfreezing temperatures could keep road conditions dangerous.
Bitter cold ahead; flurries possible
Forecasters expect the storm to give way to a stretch of frigid weather. In Wilmington, temperatures were forecast to drop into the single digits Monday night, with highs remaining in the teens and 20s through midweek.
Schools closed; some districts extend schedule changes
Closures were widespread Monday, with Delaware Public Media reporting that all of Delaware’s public school districts were closed for the day as the state dug out.
Some districts also announced additional adjustments:


Brandywine School District: no school for students Monday and Tuesday (Jan. 26–27) due to storm-related closures affecting its scheduled professional responsibilities day.


Sussex Technical High School: operated on a remote learning day Monday.


Christina School District: schools and offices closed Monday.


Warming sites and Code Purple shelters
For residents in need of a warm place to stay, the state emphasized Code Purple operations.
State officials said Code Purple shelters remained open 24 hours statewide, and shared contact numbers by county:


New Castle County: 302-652-8033


Kent County: 1-800-733-6816


Sussex County: 302-519-0024


Or call 211


Separately, DHSS advised that its offices — including State Service Centers — were closed Monday, and directed people who need shelter or support services to contact 211 for available options.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)One year into his first term as Pennsylvania’s attorney general, Dave Sunday touted a list of accomplishments, including illegal firearm recoveries, fentanyl seizures and combating scammers. 
“This first year as your attorney general was full of unique challenges and achievements, including progress in defending Pennsylvanians from modern-day threats, such as artificial intelligence and online environments that expose our children and older residents to physical, mental, and financial harm,” Sunday said in a release. “Technology and criminal methods are advancing quickly, but our great team embraces the hard work that comes with protecting people, families, and their assets.” 

An eight-minute video posted to his YouTube channel included portions of Sunday’s inaugural speech as the state’s top law enforcement officer and clips from various press conferences. A top focus was the seizure of more than 56 million fentanyl doses and 100,000 fentanyl pills, with an estimated street cost of $58 million. 
Much of that dangerous drug came from Philadelphia and its collar counties, as detailed at a press conference in October, but the issue impacts thousands of Pennsylvanians. In 2023, 4,719 Pennsylvanians died from an overdose and there were 37,371 nonfatal suspected overdoses, according to the state Department of Health. 
“But enforcement alone isn’t enough. We cannot just arrest our way out of this crisis,” Sunday said in the video, pivoting to highlight the Law Enforcement Treatment Initiative. 
The program offers an alternative to incarceration for non-violent offenders and is available in 33 counties. Initially tailored for those with substance use disorder, some counties chose to expand its reach to include mental health resources.

Additionally, 539 illegal firearms were recovered by task forces led by the Attorney General’s Office, including guns that were illegally trafficked, had no serial numbers or were possessed by individuals prohibited from buying firearms — either due to a prior felony conviction or for another reason. 
Other accountings included in the release: 

120 defendants charged with fraud, abuse or criminal waste related to the Medicaid system, leveraging more than $40 million in restitution. Another 550 cases and investigations are active. 
100 new investigations into large-scale theft and fraud under the Organized Crime Retail Unit.

After growing up in Ottumwa and graduating from Indianola’s Simpson College, I worked in South Dakota at the start of my career. I enjoyed my years in the Mount Rushmore State, but their higher education system pales in comparison to Iowa’s, and the same is true of other surrounding states. So I’m grateful to have spent the last 18 years in Iowa’s higher education system.
Iowa is the envy of other states when it comes to our full complement of higher education options: three top-notch Regents institutions, 15 excellent community colleges, and 26 nonprofit, private colleges and universities that each contribute to the economy, culture and quality of life in the communities they call home. Iowans are blessed to have access to each of these options, and we desperately need all three to continue flourishing. 
And yet, Iowa’s House of Representatives is poised to advance a bill that will likely lead to the closure of some of Iowa’s private colleges. If House Study Bill 533 becomes law, Iowa taxpayers will be on the hook for $20 million (for starters) to enable Iowa’s community colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees, something the state’s three public universities and 26 private colleges already do exceedingly well.
The argument is not valid 
The proposal’s key argument is that there are higher education “deserts” in Iowa. That’s just not true. Through Iowa’s public and private four-year colleges, all of Iowa is covered for in-person and online, undergraduate and graduate education. Moreover, Iowa already has a statewide transfer guarantee that enables students from all 15 community colleges to seamlessly complete a bachelor’s degree at Iowa, Iowa State, UNI, or nearly any Iowa private college. Northwestern is a proud participant in this program.
Rationale for the proposal’s key argument is embarrassingly weak. The report submitted to the House education subcommittee contains sparse anecdotal data with no concrete research or analysis to back its claims. No degree start-up costs or economic impacts to Iowa private colleges or their communities are identified. Alarmingly, despite this inadequate data and little meaningful input from the private colleges that have been providing four-year degrees (at zero taxpayer cost) for more than 170 years, the bill is moving recklessly forward.
At the same time, higher education faces a well-documented “enrollment cliff.” Due to declining birth rates during the 2008 recession, the number of high school graduates nationwide will decrease by 15% in the next decade. This is precisely the wrong moment to spend taxpayer dollars enabling community colleges to duplicate degrees already offered by Iowa’s four-year institutions.
‘Isn’t competition good?’
Competition is good, if the terms are fair. Despite supporters’ generous investment in private colleges, our institutions will not be able to compete with a glut of state-funded bachelor’s degrees if community colleges begin offering them too. More of Iowa’s private colleges will experience decline and closure, like Iowa Wesleyan University did in 2023.
A solution without a problem 
We need our community colleges to continue doing what only they can do! They are critical producers of the diverse workforce we need in Iowa. Many employers already can’t find enough welders, powerline workers, and other tradespeople to hire. Iowa already has three public universities and 26 private, nonprofit colleges that are superbly educating students who want bachelor’s and graduate degrees.
Iowans like a good deal. We already have a great deal with our outstanding system of higher education. Let’s not waste taxpayer dollars attempting to fix a problem that simply doesn’t exist.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Northwestern-College-photo-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The state’s newly expanded charter school co-location program could be limited after the Florida Department of Education received “a lot of feedback,” an administrator said.
The department hosted a rule development meeting Monday, soliciting feedback for Schools of Hope rules, the program that lawmakers vastly expanded in the waning hours of the 2025 legislative session.
Since the last-minute change approved by lawmakers, traditional public schools have been overwhelmed by newly-enabled charter school operators applying to open inside unused portions of public schools.
The department had not finalized rule language as of Monday. The state said it anticipates the language will be posted this week to the state’s website and that the state Board of Education will review language during its Feb. 20 meeting in Key West. The state website provides room for members of the public to submit feedback. 
Adam Emerson, director of the Office of School Choice at the department, was the only speaker during a teleconference Monday. He said since the state implemented the expansions in the fall, there has been “a lot of feedback.”
According to Emerson, some “high-level components that we will consider” in further Schools of Hope administrative rules include:

Limits around the number of building notices submitted by a single Hope operator. “We are limiting the number of building notices in this particular rule development.”
“We are looking at greater assurances around a Hope operator’s proposed co-location with a district school.”
More provisions with mutual management plans “with a goal of offsetting some of the costs that are associated with that co-location.”

“We will be looking at tweaking the criteria to approve the Hope operator” and setting timelines for operators to submit notices of intent to co-locate, Emerson said. 
The Schools of Hope program was created under former House Speaker Richard Corcoran to allow charter schools to open near “persistently low performing” schools, but the 2025 Legislature expanded the area and scope that these publicly funded and privately operated charter schools that may open in areas adjacent to “persistently low performing” traditional public schools may serve.
It allows these schools to open in low-income zones or even outside such zones if there is a suitable underused, vacant, or surplus facility, and in the attendance zone of a “persistently low performing school.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Under the new law, “hope operators” are allowed to open in vacant spaces inside public schools at no cost. School districts must provide custodial, maintenance, safety, food, nursing, and transportation services if the school of hope requests it.
In September, the day after the Board of Education implemented the law, Gov. Ron DeSantis and billionaire Ken Griffin announced that a New York-based charter operator would open in Miami.
Less than a week after the rule went into effect last fall, the Florida Policy Institute, a non-partisan policy research organization, reported that charter operators had sent 690 “letters of intent” to co-locate inside of public schools in 22 counties.
Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas defends the program, and the GOP-led Legislature has not indicated a move toward addressing school concerns in this legislative session, although Democratic legislators have proposed changes to the laws passed less than a year ago.

(Getty Images)Wolverines in the lower 48 States were trapped, hunted and poisoned to near extinction in the late 1800s and early 1900s and have not recovered, just the opposite in fact. It took court action by the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and other conservation groups to finally get the dwindling population listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in 2023.
The federal government is legally required to designate “critical habitat” to protect ecosystems for the recovery of threatened and endangered species, but has failed to do so for wolverines, which are hanging on by the thinnest of threads. To stave off extinction, we need to protect the habitat in which they can survive — a challenge now further exacerbated by an increasingly hot climate diminishing the deep snows they require for denning and food storage. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service stated that wolverines can no longer be found in New Mexico but wolverine habitat currently exists in portions of northern New Mexico, Utah, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada and Washington. Efforts are underway to reintroduce wolverines to the Southern Rockies (which include north-central New Mexico). Evaluating lands in that region for protection as critical habitat will only benefit that effort and help restore the species to the region.


It’s estimated there are only 318 wolverines remaining in the entire lower 48 States. Scientists believe the “effective population,” which is the number of individuals capable of reproducing and contributing to the next generation, is likely less than 40. 
You read that right, fewer than 40 wolverines are currently capable of keeping the species from going extinct in the contiguous U.S. And what is the U.S. Fish and Wild Service doing to recover wolverines as required by law? Not much.
The Fish and Wildlife Service noted that wolverine populations are relatively small, fragmented and isolated from larger populations in Canada. In Montana, the areas required for wolverines range from 193 to 588 square miles for males and 55 to 148 square miles for females.
To protect the ecosystems upon which wolverines depend, the Endangered Species Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to designate “critical habitat” — the areas that provide the secure habitat where they are protected from threats like incidental trapping and can successfully reproduce.
The designation of “Critical Habitat” includes those areas occupied by the species at the time of listing that possess the physical and biological features such as food, water and shelter needed for survival and recovery. These areas may also include areas not yet occupied but needed for future population growth.
Because critical habitat designation is essential to the conservation of the species, special management consideration or protections may be required.  The designation also guides federal actions to prevent destruction or modification of this habitat, thereby increasing species’ chances of recovery, 
Unfortunately the Fish and Wildlife Service has not followed the law, has not designated critical habitat, and is shirking its duty to keep wolverines from extinction — which is why the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and our fellow plaintiffs recently filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Montana. 
Although the majority (95%) of wolverine habitat in the lower 48 states is federally owned and managed by the Forest Service, there are no regulatory mechanisms or standards in Forest Service Land and Resource Management Plans to protect wolverines and their habitat. Not only is nothing being done to protect and restore wolverines and the ecosystems upon which they depend, the Forest Service has announced a massive 25% increase in national forest logging, in effect, destroying what critical habitat may be left on public lands. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service has failed — and continues to fail — to comply with its mandatory, non-discretionary, duty to designate critical habitat for wolverines as required by Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act. To maintain and recover the species our choice was either take the delinquent agency to court or watch wolverines dwindle into extinction. We sided with the wolverines and are being represented by the Western Environmental Law Center.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wolverine-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A state appeals court ordered a lower court Monday to restart proceedings over whether a casino exemption in New Jersey’s indoor smoking ban violates the state’s constitution, finding procedural deficiencies had denied the case a fair hearing.
The decision is the latest in a yearslong fight over the 2006 Smoke-Free Air Act, which banned indoor smoking statewide but allowed it to continue inside casinos and their simulcasting facilities. Casino floor workers represented by the United Auto Workers union have for years pushed to end the exemption.
A lower court judge in 2024 dismissed a complaint filed by the union and an antismoking advocacy group, but Monday’s decision dings that judge for improperly addressing the plaintiffs’ equal protection challenge and for not performing detailed fact findings. The lower court judge decided the case based on written briefs alone and no testimony, according to Monday’s ruling.
“On remand, the court shall allow the record to be developed and litigated to address the hotly contested projections of revenue loss, and for the court to make appropriate findings of fact concerning the reliability and credibility of the competing expert projections. Such findings are especially crucial to the ultimate disposition of plaintiffs’ state equal protection arguments, with the health of thousands of casino employees and, perhaps, millions of dollars at stake,” Judge Jack Sabatino wrote for the three-judge panel.
Rep. LaMonica McIver to appeal judge’s decision on her assault charges

The casino workers sued after legislative pushes to close the exception — ones that enjoyed broad support among lawmakers — stalled over concerns about the effect an indoor smoking ban would have on gambling houses’ profitability.
The workers alleged the law unconstitutionally singled them out to face the harms of secondhand smoke.
They charged it violated constitutional rights to safety and equal protection and was unconstitutional special legislation — laws that improperly single out an individual or group and do not apply to others similarly situated.
When he was governor, Phil Murphy banned smoking inside casinos for about 11 months during the pandemic, though that ban was lifted in June 2021 (Murphy left office last week).

The trial court judge in August 2024 ruled there was no constitutional right to safety, found provisions in the New Jersey Constitution related to Atlantic City and its casinos allowed special legislation, and dismissed the workers’ equal protection claims.
The workers harmed by secondhand smoke could just find other jobs, the trial judge ruled, and casino revenue demanded that the indoor smoking exception be allowed to continue.
That judge, who denied preliminary restraints to bar casino smoking and dismissed workers’ challenge to the law, erred repeatedly, the appellate court found Monday.
The trial court used the wrong test to weigh the constitutionality of the smoking exemption, asking whether a rational basis existed for such a ban rather than employing the three-part balancing test used in equal protection cases lodged under New Jersey’s Constitution, Monday’s ruling says.

The trial judge also improperly deferred to the findings of a casino-funded report that found banning indoor smoking would significantly reduce gambling houses’ revenue. That report found the ban would cut revenue by diverting smokers to casinos in other states or forcing them to interrupt their gaming for cigarette breaks.
UAW and Casino Employees Against Smoking Effects, which joined the union as a plaintiff, pointed to a separate study that found smoking and non-smoking casinos perform similarly.
The lower court took the casinos’ study at face value and did not appear to consider the one raised by smoking opponents, Monday’s decision says.
“The trial court improvidently accepted at face value respondents’ disputed economic contentions and the untested premise that ending the smoking exemption will inexorably result in drastic revenue and job losses, without a development of a fuller record,” Sabatino wrote.
The appeals panel declined to weigh whether the state’s constitution creates a right to safety, saying that matter falls outside the scope of its review and is better left to a higher authority.
“If such a sweeping right is recognized for the first time, it should be by the Supreme Court as the ultimate arbiter of our State Constitution,” wrote Sabatino.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-26 19:42:05+00:00,CT Mirror,CT legislators to pitch bill to allow lawsuits against federal agents,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/ct-legislators-to-pitch-bill-to-allow-lawsuits-against-federal-agents/,CT Democrats said they will propose a bill allowing residents to sue federal agents for violations of their constitutional rights.,"Connecticut state lawmakers said Monday that they will propose a bill allowing CT residents to sue federal law enforcement agents for violations of their constitutional rights. 
The bill’s proposal is in response to the shooting of Alex Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Saturday. Pretti is the second protester killed by federal immigration authorities in Minnesota this month, after Renee Good was shot and killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7. 
“I’ve heard from many of my constituents who are concerned that this could happen here and who are looking to the state and our state leaders and to provide some assurance that Connecticut is doing what we can to protect our residents,” said Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, during a press conference on Monday. 
Connecticut would join several other states that have enacted similar laws, including California, Massachusetts, Maine and, most recently, Illinois. 
“This is a well-established thing that we can do to make sure that if constitutional rights are violated, that the residents of the state can do something about it and can bring a lawsuit and can achieve justice,” said Lesser.
In 1983, a federal law was passed allowing for lawsuits against local and state officials in the case of a violation of constitutional rights. But there is no equivalent law allowing people to sue federal officials. In response, states began to create what are called “converse 1983 laws,” allowing for lawsuits against federal agents. 
The 1971 Supreme Court case Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics found that individuals do have a right to sue federal officials for damages relating to violations of people’s constitutional rights. But the court has not allowed a lawsuit under Bivens to proceed in more than 30 years, and a 2017 Supreme Court decision tightened its use even further. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, noted that the Westfall Act, a 1988 law that protects federal employees from personal lawsuits for their conduct while carrying out their professional duties, further limits individuals’ recourse. 
“I think it’s important for folks to be able to rest assured that the Constitution of the United States means something. If that doesn’t mean something, I don’t know who we are, what this country is,” said Winfield. 
Sen. President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said it was possible the law could be challenged by the federal government. The federal government sued the state of Illinois last month, claiming that a law allowing people to sue federal immigration agents went against the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which says that federal law overrides state law. 
But Looney disagreed that the proposed Connecticut law was at odds with the U.S. Constitution. 
“These actions actually further the ultimate supremacy of the federal constitution by helping people vindicate their fundamental federal constitutional rights,” said Looney. 
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, welcomed debate on the proposed law in a statement he issued Monday. 
“Anyone who breaks state or federal laws should be held accountable for their actions. In the meantime, the amped up rhetoric and the violence must end. Anyone who doesn’t like how the law is enforced is free to advocate for different laws, and to protest peacefully,” said Harding. 
Democratic lawmakers said they had been working with the Connecticut chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union to draft the legislation. 
There have been constitutional violations in Connecticut as ICE increased its presence here, said Chelsea Infinity-Gonzalez, ACLU-CT’s director of public policy and advocacy.  
“ There’s operations ramping up all around us, in New York and Massachusetts, most recently in Maine. And so it truly is only a matter of time,” said Gonzalez. 
Gonzalez said the ACLU was also working on legislation that would regulate the use of license plate readers so that the data collected was not used to assist federal law enforcement. 
At the federal level, Connecticut politicians have widely criticized the shootings in Minnesota, and several have called for an independent investigation into the shooting. State investigators were not allowed access to evidence in the shooting of Good, and Drew Evans, superintendent of Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which investigates police shootings, told reporters Saturday that federal officers had blocked his agency from the scene of Pretti’s shooting even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday, calling on him to share records on the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to repeal “sanctuary policies” and allow detention centers to cooperate with ICE, and to provide the federal government with access to the state’s voter rolls. 
Connecticut, along with 22 other states, has been sued in federal court by the Trump Administration for its voting records. The state in July joined 20 other states in a lawsuit pushing back against a directive from the federal government to provide data on people enrolled in SNAP. 
In response to a question from CT Mirror, spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office Elizabeth Benton said the state “has not received such a letter” from Bondi and referred to earlier comments in which she said that any statements about hypothetical requests for data from the federal government would be “premature” and depend on the exact data requested. 
Duff said during the press conference that the federal government was targeting Democratic-led states, and that Connecticut would “resist feverishly.”“The federal government does not run elections, and we’re not going to give them data in order to try to make a mockery of our residents, our voters, and anyone else for their cruel and dangerous policies,” he said. 
Connecticut’s congressional delegation last week voted against a bill that would fund the federal Department of Homeland Security. The bill passed the House of Representatives and is now headed to the Senate.

Federal Emergency Management Agency officials are in the state to help distribute generators, meals, blankets and other supplies after President Donald Trump approved an emergency declaration for Mississippi on Saturday, Gov. Tate Reeves announced Monday.
The state’s largest electric providers had few estimates Monday for how long it will take to restore power, with multiple providers citing difficulties assessing damage. Frigid temperatures, icy roads and downed trees have impeded restoration efforts. Two deaths – one each in Hinds County and Tishomingo County – and two injuries from the storm have been reported in the state.
About 153,000 customers were without power across 47 of he 82 counties at midday Monday, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said.
Entergy
Entergy Mississippi serves over 400,000 customers in 45 counties. The company said Monday that the storm had impacted 55,000 of its customers and it had deployed over 2,000 workers.
In a video press release Monday, Haley Fisackerly, president and CEO of Entergy Mississippi, reminded people to stay away from downed power lines and to report any downed lines to 1-800-968-8243 or on www.entergy.com. 
Fisackerly added that continued freezing temperatures could cause more outages.

Electric Cooperatives of Mississippi 
Twelve of the Electric Cooperatives of Mississippi’s 26 operations have requested restoration assistance with additional crews coming from out of state. According to a Monday press release, travel is dangerous in parts of the state that have been hardest hit and it is difficult to say when everything will be back on.
Tishomingo County Electric Power Association
“It’s a war zone out here,” said Cody Durham, CEO of Tishomingo County Electric Power Association. Around 80% of Tishomingo Electric’s customers are without power. 
Durham said restoring power to the county’s electric water pumps is the first priority. He hopes water would be restored by Monday night. 
“We’re doing the best we can to work through these tough conditions,” Durham said. Because of cold and icy conditions, he said it’s impossible to know the exact extent of the damage. He requested additional crews to help clear trees and repair lines. He urged people to check for warming shelters that are being set up in the county and go there if the roads are passable.
Tippah, Alcorn, Benton and Union counties 
The Tippah Electric Power Association, which serves 13,927 customers in Tippah, Alcorn, Benton, and Union counties in Mississippi as well as Hardeman County in Tennessee, reported Monday that all but six of its customers had lost power. The provider said Sunday it is looking at “weeks instead of days to restore power” to everyone.
The utility is one of several in north Mississippi that buys power from the Tennessee Valley Authority.
“Tippah EPA still does not have feed to 5 of our substations,” the utility wrote on its Facebook page. On Sunday, the provider wrote that its power distribution system had “suffered catastrophic damage.”
“TVA and local power company crews are working around the clock to restore service as safely and quickly as possible,” TVA spokesperson Julia Wise told Mississippi Today on Monday. “We are making progress despite difficult conditions for workers, including fallen trees, deep snow, icy roads and frigid temperatures. Crews are on the ground and in the air assessing storm damage and repairing transmission lines.”
TVA serves 346,000 customers in northeastern Mississippi, through local public utilities and cooperatives.
Officials in Ripley, the county seat of Tippah County, reported both gas and water outages in addition to the power troubles. “Most areas” of Ripley dealt with water issues after an outage at a pump station, city officials wrote on social media. 
On Sunday, the city also reported a “major gas line break” between Ripley and Blue Mountain that left “many residents” without gas. Officials Monday said repairs were still in progress.
Water and generator system failures
Local newsrooms report boil-water notices for Quitman County, Panola County and Holly Springs. The Mississippi State Department of Health’s Bureau of Public Water Supply is working with local water systems to clear the boil advisories, according to department spokesperson Greg Flynn. 
He said no contamination has been reported, but water systems need to check their quality whenever a power outage causes a drop in water pressure. Because there may be no power to boil water in some places, Flynn said people might need to use bottled water.
County emergency management contacts in Quitman County, Panola County and Marshall County did not immediately respond to Mississippi Today’s calls Monday. Scott Simmons, Mississippi Emergency Management Authority’s external affairs director, said MEMA is working with local governments and the state Department of Transportation to take 64,000 bottles of water to north Mississippi communities that lack access to fresh tap water. 
The authority was sending the water and 30 generators to Camp McCain in Grenada before distributing them to communities.
Simmons said the generators would go to health buildings serving vulnerable groups — long-term care facilities, hospitals, nursing homes and warming centers. He said multiple locations had generators that failed during the weekend, and only some had started working again by early Monday. 
“It’s going to be a challenge, but that’s the challenge we’re tackling right now,” Simmons said.
David Kenney, a spokesperson for the state transportation department, said the agency was continuing to clear fallen trees from highways and interstates.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/25122912/oxford-storm-20260125-1027.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Shockwaves from the shooting death of an anti-ICE Minneapolis protester over the weekend are reverberating throughout the Republican Party and even dividing conservative leaders within Florida — the most ICE-friendly state in the nation.
The cracks in the resounding GOP support for the Department of Homeland Security are both rare and a first under President Donald Trump, whose promise of mass deportations helped him win in November 2024. But the tactics employed to carry out that agenda have begun to raise concerns, even among the president’s most ardent of supporters.
“Distorting, politicizing, slandering — justifying what happened to Alex Pretti contradicts the American values the administration campaigned on,” Republican state Sen. Ileana Garcia posted on social media Monday morning. The Miamian co-founded “Latinas for Trump” in 2016.
Ileana Garcia via Florida Senate
“He was neither a domestic terrorist nor an assassin. … Allowing individuals like Stephen Miller, among others, who represent the government and make hard-line decisions, to make such comments will have long-term consequences,” she warned. “This is not what I voted for!”
This is the second time Garcia, the daughter of Cuban exiles, has criticized the Trump administration’s actions on undocumented immigration. In June, she similarly blasted Trump’s homeland security adviser, Miller, for his “inhumane” approach to mass deportations.
Other Republicans like U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar offered more muted criticisms. 
“Washington’s failure on immigration is hitting our streets. Minneapolis is the result of Washington refusing to fix a broken immigration system and continuing to enforce outdated laws,” she wrote on social media, calling for an end to “chaos” and “tragedy.” 
“There is precisely one bipartisan bill … that revamps our immigration system, including ICE enforcement policy, so they don’t need to be out in large-scale operations in our communities,” she added.
Florida Republicans have long-touted how the Sunshine State is the most friendly in the nation to Trump’s mass deportation agenda. This includes multiple state-run migrant detention centers, all 67 counties partnering with ICE, and laws (although contested) preventing undocumented immigrants from entering the state.
What happened?
On Saturday, 37-year-old VA ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed during a struggle with Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. Pretti, who had a revolver stowed in his belt, approached an officer while recording. The agent had just shoved a woman to the ground, videos show.
Pretti was quickly swarmed by five officers. According to video footage, one officer appears to take Pretti’s revolver out of his waistband before another discharges his weapon and kills him.
DHS offered another version of events.
“An individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun. The officers attempted to disarm the suspect, but the armed suspect reacted violently,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed.
This was the second videoed death of an ICE protester in Minneapolis in a matter of weeks. On Jan. 7, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE while fleeing in her vehicle. Officials say she was attempting to run over an agent with her car, prompting the lethal action.
 Growing call for action

Garcia isn’t the only Republican demanding answers. U.S. Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican chairing the House Homeland Security Committee, is requesting ICE and CBP testify in front of his panel.
Other congressional members from Texas, North Carolina, Louisiana, Maine, and Alaska are also calling for an investigation. Even Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Nebraska Republican and staunch Trump supporter, has asked for a “transparent investigation.” Others like the National Rifle Association have criticized the administration in the surrounding chatter of Pretti’s death.
This came after FBI Director Kash Patel claimed, “You cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.” That’s false, and the NRA said as much.
But not all Republicans are breaking ranks. Gov. Ron DeSantis blamed Minnesota’s Democratic leadership for its “toxic environment,” although he didn’t mention Pretti’s death specifically. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Pretti.
“What we’re not doing is what people like [Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz] and what this Mayor are doing, which is basically trying to sabotage the enforcement operations,” DeSantis said during an unrelated press conference Monday morning. “ They’re creating a toxic environment where they’re really inciting people to go out and show hostility to the agents who are doing this. That is not a recipe for success. That is not the way that you do business.”
Pretti’s death has even been reflected into the looming Florida gubernatorial race. Democrat David Jolly, a former Republican member of Congress, called the shooting a “murder” and demanded Noem be removed from her post.
“We know what we saw. An American citizen practicing civil disobedience was disarmed and then shot 10 times in the street, and his body lay lifeless and he was murdered,” Jolly said during a campaign event, Florida Today reported.
But his opponent and favored candidate to replace DeSantis, U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, saw the situation differently. On an appearance with Fox News, Donalds — endorsed by Trump — apologized to immigration agents for “having to deal with all these protests.”
“We stand behind you, we want you to continue to do your job on behalf of the United States of America,” he said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alexpretti-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)For the fourth consecutive year, Utah lawmakers rejected a proposal aimed at holding gun owners accountable when an improperly stored firearm ends up being used by a minor to commit a crime. 
In a 9-2 vote, the House Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Committee shot down HB80, sponsored by Rep. Andrew Stoddard, D-Millcreek. The bill would have created a class C misdemeanor penalty for unsafe firearm storage. The bill would not punish adults for gun accidents or if the firearm is used for self defense, suicide, or if it is reported stolen. 
“This isn’t for the tragic situations where there is a loaded firearm that’s not secured, a child gets it, and then dies from an accidental shooting,” Stoddard, the bill sponsor, said during the committee meeting. “In order to qualify under this proposed statute, it would have to be used intentionally in a fight or a quarrel.”
Republican committee members raised concerns about gun owners accessing their firearms in case of a home invasion, saying “seconds count” in dangerous self-defense situations. They argued secure gun storage can delay access and hinder self-defense.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Stoddard said HB80 is similar to a Florida law that holds gun owners liable when a minor uses a firearm “in a public place” or “in a rude, careless, angry or threatening manner.” Twenty-seven states and Washington D.C. have secure storage laws aimed at preventing children from accessing a firearm, according to a Johns Hopkins study. 
“This is just one small step to try to help it so that we don’t have to be so reactive, that we can be proactive in stopping school shootings with the side effect of stopping firearm suicides,” Stoddard said. 
The same Johns Hopkins study found that child access prevention “was associated with reductions in youth gun suicide rates.” As Utah’s high youth suicide rate continues to increase, Stoddard sees HB80 as a helpful mechanism to reduce that tragic statistic.
“You can see that the data is clear,” Stoddard said. “These types of laws help.”
A narrower bill every year
For the last four years, Stoddard has sponsored some version of a gun storage bill without success, narrowing the legislation every year in an effort to respond to lawmakers’ concerns.
“I’ve worked with the drafting attorneys year after year to try to get this as narrow as possible,” Stoddard said in an interview with Utah News Dispatch. “There’s really nothing else we can do to make it more narrow, other than drop it to an infraction, which at this point just seems ridiculous.”
HB80 includes four requirements, all of which must be met to proceed with criminal prosecution of a firearm owner in the event a minor uses it to commit a crime:

A gun owner fails to secure a loaded firearm in a “box, case, chest, locker, safe, or similar receptacle that is secured in such a manner so as to prevent an individual from accessing the contents of the container.”
A gun owner “knows or reasonably should know that a minor is likely to obtain possession of the loaded firearm.”
The minor obtains access to the firearm in violation of “Section 76-11-211, possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor.”
The minor “possesses, exhibits, or uses the firearm in a public place; or draws, exhibits, or unlawfully uses the firearm” as a “dangerous weapon in (a) fight or quarrel.”

For third year in a row, Utah lawmakers shoot down secure firearm storage law  

“It is a very strict statute. You saw four separate requirements that had to have been met,” Stoddard said. “This isn’t just, ‘oh, I didn’t lock up my gun. Now you can charge me with a crime.’ This is, ‘I didn’t lock up my gun. I knew a kid could get it. Kid got it, kid did something illegal with it.’”
Despite multiple failed attempts, Stoddard said he plans to “keep bringing back” similar legislation in the future. “I feel very strongly about it, both in terms of gun violence, safety and also mental health,” he said. “It should be a higher crime, but I wanted to pass something the committee would be comfortable with in terms of bill language and bill level.”
“At this point, there’s nowhere else to go,” Stoddard added. “It’s either we want kids to be safe and we’re willing to deal with what might be an inconvenience of locking up our firearms and requiring people to do the same, or we’re just OK with it because we don’t want to step into that role.”
Violent gun crime
During public comment, Brett Robinson, chief policy adviser for the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s office, spoke in favor of the bill, citing trends in youth violence. 
“Up until five years ago, the demographic that committed the most homicides in our state was those who are 20 to 29 years of age at 150 homicides,” he said. “You flash forward to the last 10 years, the demographic with the most homicides are those who are 10 to 19 years of age, with 164.”
Robinson thanked the committee for previous legislation aimed at reducing youth crime, but emphasized HB80 could serve as an additional preventative tool. 
“This is another avenue that perhaps can decrease that number, and that’s just to stem the flow of these guns that get in the hands of children,” he said. “Many of the cases that we prosecute involve minors, and many of them get these guns or access to them within their own homes. Doing something to encourage responsible ownership is something that we believe will decrease the amount of cases that we need to prosecute.”

University of Utah freshman Ivy Manno expressed concern for mass shootings during public comment, referencing her experience with a school shooting that targeted a neighboring high school in Denver. 
“My generation knows all too well the devastation that gun violence can wreck in someone’s life,” she said. “My experience leads me to emphasize how important safe storage is today.”
Manno is a member of Students Demand Action, a student-run, anti-gun violence activist group. She spoke with Utah News Dispatch after the committee meeting and expressed frustration with the vote. 
“I think there was a slight misunderstanding of the bill in a lot of cases,” she said. “It can be construed in a different light, to make it sound like they’re trying to criminalize gun owners, but that really is not the intent.”
Opposition to the bill
The bill was voted down along party lines, with the nine Republican committee members who opposed it citing home defense and rural gun ownership. 
“I don’t know that we’re in a position where we should be mandating (firearm storage),” said Rep. Matthew Gwynn, R-Farr West, pointing to concern about “defending the sanctity of the home.” 
Referencing his own experience as a firearm owner, Gwynn said his family does not lock up all their firearms. 
“I don’t know that I can support a bill that’s going to make myself in violation of the statute,” he added. “This bill will make me a criminal. That’s the reality … we live in a world where sometimes we get threats.”
Clark Aposhian, board chairman for the Utah Shooting Sports Council and the organization’s registered lobbyist, spoke in opposition to the safe storage bill. He expressed concern that the bill would shift the “burden of proof in criminal law from (the) state to the individual.”
“HB80 shifts the legal burden in a very concerning way,” Aposhian said. “It includes an affirmative defense clause, so gun owners now must prove they comply with the state’s safe storage expectation if a minor acts as a firearm.”
Stoddard responded to Aposhian’s claims when he spoke with the Dispatch. “That’s 100% inaccurate. We have so many statues with affirmative defenses, and it’s not something that’s novel to this bill,” he said. “We have a lot of criminal statutes that have affirmative defenses. So it doesn’t shift the burden. It’s essentially a way out.”
Stoddard also emphasized that the bill’s narrow scope would prevent frequent prosecution under HB80. “This isn’t something that would get charged very often, and if it was, it would be in a justice court where someone could come in and say, ‘hey, look, here’s how I had this locked up.’ (The) prosecutor can see it and dismiss the case, and that’s why we provided that escape valve.”

Phaneuf discuss his article about Susan Keane, who is retiring after four decades.","Susan Keane spent four decades shaping fiscal policy in Connecticut. This will be the first year the General Assembly will convene without her since 1983.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Keith Phaneuf to discuss his article, “Susan Keane, champion of open budgeting in CT, calls it a career,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Keith’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Keith. Over the years, most of us have turned to you to help explain the intricacies of Connecticut state budgets. So it’s fascinating to hear about Susan Keane, the person behind the scenes who helped shape Connecticut budgets for more than four decades. She was your guide to understanding the state’s budget. Tell us about Susan and about how you first met her.
KP: Well, I first met Susan Keane back in the early 1990s, 1993 to be exact, when I was literally just in my first session trying to understand how the Appropriations Committee works. I think a lot of reporters tend to think, Well, the first thing I have to do is get to know the legislators. But what I learned early on is that good, non-partisan staff are what make every committee work. They’re the folks who handle the records, who gathered the research for legislators, who organized the meetings. And it was Susan Keane who first really showed me how that process worked. And it took me a while to realize how much I was benefiting just from how seriously she took that process.
WSHU: Now, you say that she kept things on track; she pretty much kept things moving. And crafting a budget is a very complicated business. Could you just tell us what goes into it and how she was able to keep on top of it?
KP: I can tell you what goes into it, if you want me to explain how she was able to pull it off — I still haven’t learned. It’s a very long process. We tend to think most folks, when they think of the budget, of the budget or the state budget, they just think of a book or the money that’s spent, but really it’s, it’s the product of months and months of work. The legislature’s Appropriations Committee, which has roughly 50 members, one of the largest committees, has a dozen subcommittees, and at any given time, its members can also be assigned to different task forces. They will, over the course of about two to two and a half months, be conducting dozens of hearings, not just the committee proper, but all of the different subcommittees. They break the budget down, and one subcommittee will deal with human services, and another with transportation, and so on. And I mean, most news organizations have one or two folks covering the capital. You can’t even get to all those meetings, so you’ve got to be able to go back, look at the minutes, and try to figure out what’s important. Meanwhile, in some sessions, hundreds of bills move through a committee, all of which, if they have any fiscal impact, ultimately become part of the budget. The fact that Susan has a system that allows you to get that information pretty much at your fingertips is amazing.
WSHU: Well, that’s really amazing. Let’s talk a little bit about Susan, the person. How did she get into this in the first place?
KP: Susan sort of got into it by accident. She was attending the University of Hartford. She wasn’t intending to work in government, but there was an opportunity for an internship at the state capitol. State Representative at the time in the late 1970s, Tom Serrani of Stamford, picked her for that internship, and within two years, he had asked her to run the Transportation Committee. A few more years after that, her mentor insisted that she apply for an opening with the Appropriations Committee, and she very quickly, not only got the job, but developed a close friendship with the house chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee at the time, a state representative named Janet Polinski, who really instilled in Susan a deep appreciation for open government.
WSHU: Now, you know, you say that she did not particularly care for the Appropriations Committee. She felt it was something that would be difficult for her to understand. How did she warm up to it?
KP: Well, what she said originally was, because Susan’s very loyal, and she was working on the Transportation Committee, and she noticed that the Appropriations Committee killed a lot of their bills, meaning whatever the Transportation Committee legislators were asking for money. The way Susan recalled it, appropriation said no, but I think appropriation, some folks call it the feeling committee. It is really where, probably more than any other committee, the public consistently reaches out. I mean, the average person may never testify in their life before the General Assembly, or maybe once or twice, but when you get that issue, that drives you to the point where you may want to drive to Hartford, or nowadays, thanks to Susan Keane, there are sometimes opportunities to testify online, or even if you submit something in writing, usually there’s dollars attached to it, which means, sooner or later, it goes through the Appropriations Committee, and I think, dealing with the public and seeing how people needed a way to connect with their legislators. And Susan saw herself as the facilitator of that connection, and I think that’s what drew her to the job and kept her on the job.
WSHU: How did she make that process open to the general public? What exactly did she do?
KP: Again, so many ways. I’ll just give you a few examples. Okay, if there were challenges in testifying. Let’s say you were a community college student, and you really wanted to talk to the General Assembly about some cutbacks, but just because of your classes, nine to five wasn’t working, Susan would find a way to make sure that there might be evening hours. There were instances, at times, where folks with mental illness, perhaps because of anxiety or other issues, really had trouble staying in a crowded room, so she’d have different procedures to stagger the testimony. Traditionally, a lot of times, committees let public officials go more quickly than the general public. Susan reversed it the other way and said, okay, the folks who have the mental health needs, we’ll take care of them. First, one of the things, if you’ll permit me, though, I want to also point out, as a member of the media, that was huge. You know, if you’re trying to cover an issue, it’s hard enough, it’s complicated enough. But if legislators are discussing a document, say a draft section of a portion of the budget, and you want to follow along. It’s hard enough to follow the discussion, but imagine if you’re following it and you don’t have a copy of the document they’re discussing. Now you might get it afterward. But Susan made sure you could get it while they were talking about it. She said, I know reporters will be coming to me saying, Can I get a copy so I know when they turn to page 43, What the heck is on page 43. Susan already had copies ready. She had an organized process to make sure the copies didn’t run out.
WSHU: Wow, I can really identify with that. You say that during COVID, she took the helm and made it possible for the hybrid hearing system to be developed, where you would have online people testifying online. Could you just tell us a little bit about how that evolved and how she took charge of that?
KP: Susan had been involved for years in taking the lead on training legislative staff, new legislators, providing an orientation for them, and assisting lobbyists to try to understand how the process works. So it was natural that during the coronavirus pandemic, when the pandemic struck, legislative leaders turned to her to basically say, please take the lead and try to set up a process. I mean, we’ve always had, I shouldn’t say, always, for a long time now there’s been the Connecticut Network, the internet news and cable news system for the legislature, and they have most of the hearing rooms in the Legislative Office Building wired for sound, and there are cameras, but it’s not interactive. You can watch something on CT-n, but it’s not like you can speak to legislators through your computer screen. So we had to set up with, you know, remote technology systems.
And I’m not saying like, for example, that. Susan Keane invented Zoom. But if you think about it, the legislature has very specific rules, for example, on how you conduct a meeting and how you vote, and you can’t just assume Jane Doe voted, because I think I heard some sound in the ether, and Susan set up a process to keep the things going, keep the debates going, keep the votes going, where folks would have to almost like, I think I compared it to a game of Simon Says. First, Simon says, turn on your computer camera, show your face. Then Simon says, state your full name. Then Simon says, state how you’re going to vote. Then wait to make sure the committee administrator has confirmed it. And at the beginning, folks continue to forget what Simon said and Sue with without ever any arrogance, would gently, sort of steer them back, go through it all. She also set up tons, most folks don’t even know of YouTube channels for General Assembly committees, which also creates another record. So if you miss a meeting, you can go back. Say you just wanted to watch. But for some reason, the event wasn’t on the Connecticut Networks’ main news feeds. You could find it on YouTube.
And just one last point, I’m sorry to drag this out. This system is still very much in play. There will be a lot of hybrid meetings. Most meetings now are hybrid, where some folks are in attendance, some aren’t. There will be times when the legislature, a legislative committee, really can’t schedule enough votes unless they have remote attendance, and it makes committee meetings so much more efficient, because you can gather them relatively quickly, because folks don’t all have to drive in from Hartford.
WSHU: Now you say that Susan will be missed at the Capitol for her Irish wit and fiery red hair, not to mention a deep appreciation of music and dance. Could you tell us about the music and dance aspect?
KP: Well, she was an Irish step dancer as a child, actually very accomplished at that in the 80s and 90s. And I’m feeling old here, because I definitely remember the 90s with the General Assembly session, and there was a really big party after midnight, after they gaveled out. And Susan always enjoyed her dance. Her knowledge of music, though, is staggering. I mean, like I said, if you want to talk classical, if you want to talk big band, if you want to talk hip hop, if you want to talk 70s pop, or 70s funk, or 80s pop. It does not matter. Susan Keane is right there with you.
WSHU: And you say she will always be remembered for her laughter and sense of humor.
KP: Yes, Susan certainly was always very focused on the job. But there were a few times when, if we let’s put it this way, she never shortchanged a laugh. Susan did not. There was not a little mild chuckle. If she was going to laugh, she committed full-scale. She commits full scale to that laugh.
WSHU: Well, thank you so much, Keith. I really appreciate this behind-the-scenes look at the administrative staff that makes the Capitol work.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0109_SR_SusanKeane_085-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

In a conversation moderated by Dr. Ebony Lumumba, a Jackson Stave University English professor, Davis will discuss the connection between freedom struggles in the Deep South and in Sudan, Congo and Palestine. It will center on themes from her 2016 book “Freedom is a Constant Struggle.” Attendees can submit questions that Lumumba will review and select for the moderated discussion.

The event will be at Woolworth Chapel starting at 5 p.m., with doors opening at 4 p.m. It is free and open to the public. An RSVP is not required to enter and does not guarantee seating. There will also be a livestream. 
Humanitarian organization Mississippi for a Just World partnered with Tougaloo College and Black With No Chaser to create the Voices for a Just World Lecture series.
“One of our main focuses is on educating community, and we want to bring dynamic speakers who have radical imaginations that are rooted in the fight for human rights,” said Candace Abdul-Tawwab, MSJW’s co-founder and executive director.
C.J. Lawrence, co-founder and CEO of Black With No Chaser, said, “It’s very rare that you would get the opportunity to do this. I think it’s important that we seize the moment while we can to connect with a revolutionary person and icon like Professor Angela Davis.”
Abdul-Tawwab said that partnering with Tougaloo College made sense because of the institution’s legacy as a hub for civil rights activists. Several people who work at Black With No Chaser are Tougaloo alumni.
In the 1960s and 70s, Davis was a prominent activist and member of the Communist Party of the United States of America and associated with the Black Panther Party. She previously spoke at Tougaloo College in 2015. Davis, a Birmingham native, was previously a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and vice presidential nominee.

James Comer received praise from President Donald Trump for a weekend interview where the congressman had suggested the president should consider removing federal immigration agents from Minnesota. 
Comer, who represents Kentucky’s 1st Congressional District, was critical of Democratic Minnesota leaders, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, for “getting people jacked up” about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in the state on Fox’s Sunday Morning Features with Maria Bartiromo. Comer contrasted the situation in Minneapolis with Washington, D.C., where Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration has cooperated with federal law enforcement and National Guard troops deployed by Trump to fight crime. 
ICE agents fatally shot a 37-year-old man, Alex Pretti, in Minneapolis on Saturday. The death comes roughly two weeks after an ICE officer shot 37-year-old Renee Good. 
“If I were President Trump, I would almost think about, ‘OK, if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way, and there’s a chance of losing more innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide: Do we want to continue to have all of these illegals? Are we going to allow our governor, attorney general and mayor to get away with this?”
Comer continued, adding that he thinks Minnesotans would “rebel against their leadership” over illegal immigration. 
Trump wrote on Truth Social Sunday afternoon that Comer “was GREAT in his Interview” on Fox, adding that Comer had “said it all” about Minnesota and other topics. 
“Jamie is doing a fantastic job!” the president said. 
The president announced on Monday that he would send U.S. border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota following Pretti’s death. 
On Fox, Bartiromo also asked Comer if ICE officers saw Pretti was armed during Saturday’s incident. The Kentucky Lantern’s sister outlet, the Minnesota Reformer, reported that a local official said the victim in the shooting was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. 
“I’ve watched that video dozens of times in slow motion. I’ve tried to determine whether he actually pulled a gun out or not,” Comer said. “I don’t know. I just know that the situation’s bad there.”
Comer then blamed sanctuary policies in Minnesota for illegal immigration in the state.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fancyfarm_001-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 14:57:33.271668

The new version of the state’s Work-Based Learning Tax Credit, approved in 2025, took effect this month. It replaces two prior incentives and supports learning requirements in Louisiana’s new school accountability system. 
The nonprofit Leaders for a Better Louisiana advocated for the tax credit changes because few employers took advantage of the old ones, chief policy officer Barry Erwin said.
“The change in the accountability system has prompted school districts and superintendents to consider more ways to involve students in internships and other work-based learning experiences in high school, so hopefully it will be a win-win,” Erwin said in an email, “Help meet school performance goals for students and provide employers a stronger incentive to hire them.” 
In 2024, Louisiana’s Board of Elementary and Secondary Education approved a school accountability system that places a greater emphasis on high schools offering work-based learning experiences to their students. The system went into effect for the 2025-26 school year. A student who takes part in a work-based learning program under the accountability system also qualifies their employer for the tax credit.
The credit is available to businesses who make eligible hires in 2026. The amount of the credit is $2.50 per hour worked, up to a maximum of $2,500 per eligible worker per year. Students must work for their employers for at least 100 hours in the tax year for the business to qualify for the credits. The old credit offered $1.25 per hour worked and required businesses to employ the student for at least 250 hours per year. 
In certain circumstances, the credit can apply to workers up to age 24 who are not in high school. It is non-refundable, but any credit that exceeds a company’s Louisiana tax liability can be carried forward for up to five years.
Employers can claim the credit on their tax returns beginning in 2027. Total tax credits are capped at $1 million the first year but are allowed to grow to a maximum of $7.5 million in future years if participation grows.
Louisiana lags well behind other Southern states in the number of young people participating in internships and apprenticeships. Only about 5% out of the more than 40,000 Louisiana high school students who graduate annually hold an internship credit each year. The percentage is up to five times higher in Georgia and Tennessee, according to a Leaders for a Better Louisiana report last year. 
The same goes for apprenticeships. Louisiana has fewer apprenticeships than many of its neighboring states, and they pay the least. Only three out of every 1,000 Louisiana students graduate high school with apprenticeship experience, compared with nine in Arkansas. Apprenticeships in Louisiana pay an average of $14.90 per hour, comparable to the Arkansas wage but much less than Mississippi’s $21 per hour, according to the Leaders for a Better Louisiana report. 
Applications for Louisiana’s tax credit will be approved on a first-come, first-served basis and must be submitted between Jan. 1 and Feb. 28 each year through the Louisiana Taxpayer Access Point, known as LaTap for short. 
More information can be obtained from the Louisiana Department of Revenue.

(Bryce Dix/KUNM)Two bills that aim to strip the Mexican gray wolf of its federal endangered species protections are now snaking their way through the federal lawmaking process.
The Republican-led pieces of legislation – the “Pet and Livestock Protection Act” introduced by U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, (R-Colo.) and the “Enhancing Safety for Animals Act of 2025” authored by U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar, (R-Ariz.) – would essentially do the same thing: delist the Mexican gray wolf from the Endangered Species Act.
If successful, the delisting would shift management back to the states of New Mexico and Arizona, potentially create “opportunities” for lobo hunting and trapping (depending on individual state regulations), and halt genetic diversification efforts.
While similar attempts to delist the animal have failed in the past, the current political atmosphere has advocates worried about what might happen if Congress decides the wolf doesn’t need help anymore.
Leia Barnett, a conservation advocate with the New Mexico-based environmental non-profit WildEarth Guardians, said she is stunned these bills are sailing through Congress, and wants politicians to ground themselves in the science of consistent management of the species, not political bickering.
“We’re not going to see that if we’ve got a patchwork management scheme that’s based on individual state agencies determining what’s right, rather than a larger national plan that can work towards meaningful, robust recovery,” Barnett told KUNM.
On Thursday, Rep. Gosar’s bill went through a “committee markup” meant to tweak language before a bill is sent to the House floor.
There, Gosar made the claim that the wolf “has been recovered” and his constituents are “paying the price” for increasing livestock depredations.
“Ranchers are losing cattle, horses and dogs,” Gosar said. “Families who have been stewards for the land for generations are being driven out of business.”
Although the species was almost completely wiped off the landscape from trapping and hunting, the Mexican wolf population has made a significant comeback thanks to coordinated recovery efforts and the broad protections of the Endangered Species Act.
At the same time, as wolf numbers continue to grow, data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shows that cattle kills have been proportionally dropping since 2019.
[data-viz src=”
Despite these discrepancies, Gosar said the federal management of the wolf is costing taxpayers and ranchers lots of money.
“This is not an anti-conservation bill, it is a pro-science, pro-law and pro-people bill,” Gosar said in support of his own legislation. “It acknowledges success where success has been achieved, and rejects the notion that federal agencies should operate without limits or consequences.”
To conservationists like Barnett, it’s not as black and white.
“There is robust science that tells us what we need to have a healthy, thriving, resilient lobo population,” Barnett said. “That includes 750 wolves at a minimum, dispersed across three interconnected sub populations of 200 wolves.”
A recent survey count estimates there are around 286 wolves in New Mexico and Arizona.
Additionally, research shows that the genetic diversity of the species is dangerously low – so much so, the whole population is as genetically related as siblings.
After the brief debate about the lobo’s recovery – ranging from the population’s growth, to the loss of rancher livestock from depredations, to science – the House Committee on Natural Resources ultimately decided to leave most of Gosar’s bill untouched, and recommended the full House pass the measure when it’s taken up for a vote.
The language of this bill, in particular, is alarming to Barnett because it would make any future attempts to relist the wolf much harder by preventing wildlife managers from considering the recovery status of lobos south of the border.
“That’s vindictive and malicious,” Barnett said. “It’s not based upon the needs of that species.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Boebert’s attempt at delisting the wolf is much farther along in the legislative process. It has already cleared the House and is now moving through Senate committee assignments.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brycedixphoto-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 13:57:12.861996

(Photo by Meghan Riley)A lawsuit filed by more than 15 conservation organizations says that the federal government has stalled in its plans to save wolverines. The lawsuit asks a court to compel the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to lay out specific plans to protect the threatened species’ habitat, the first part of the conservation project.
Biologists and conservation organizations have long lobbied scientists and politicians to place the wolverine on the Endangered Species List as a “threatened species,” a designation that focuses on a species’ habitat and ranges. The Biden administration did that in February 2023.
After an animal or plant is placed on the list, federal law allows the government a year to determine its range — the places that need to be protected and given special consideration in order to stop further losses. The federal government may extend that time by one year, if it needs, according to the lawsuit.
However, more than two years have passed, and the conservation organizations say that the federal government is violating its own laws by not moving forward on the process, even as the Trump administration looks to remove protections for other species, like grizzly bears and gray wolves.
“The service has yet to initiate the process of designating critical habitat for wolverines,” the lawsuit said. “The service is not actively working on a proposed rule to designate critical habitat for wolverines.”
 Wolverine populations in the West

The lawsuit said organizations included in the lawsuit have been commenting, and reminding the federal government, about the deadline. Now, they say the courts have the power to act and compel the federal government to begin the process.
“The (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) determined wolverine warranted listing under the ESA, primarily due to ongoing and increasing impacts of climate change and associated habitat degradation and fragmentation,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit said science proves wolverines need the snow of high elevations in order to den and rear their kits. Those areas are being impacted by both climate change and more human encroachment, the lawsuit states.
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that 50 wolverines occupy the Idaho/Montana linkage area and 63 are in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, as of November 2023. Furthermore, it estimated just a few more than 200 wolverines in the Lower 48 states beyond those in and around Montana’s ranges.
“Wolverine populations, though widespread, were relatively small, fragmented and isolated from larger populations in Canada,” the lawsuit said.
The groups say that the service has not been able to provide any documentation that process has even begun, now more than two years after the designation.
“Wolverines are just hanging on — down to roughly 300 individuals. They deserve and desperately need all the protections guaranteed by law after being recognized as threatened, including critical habitat” said Matthew Bishop, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center. “Having areas set aside as critical habitat is a major — if not the most important — factor in helping threatened and endangered wildlife recover. Given wolverines’ small population size and climate change quickly shrinking the snowy habitat they rely on to survive, time is of the essence.”
The groups who are suing the federal government include: Friends of the Bitterroot, WildEarth Guardians, Friends of the Wild Swan, Swan View Coalition, Oregon Wild, Cascadia Wildlands, Alliance for the Wild Rockies, Cottonwood Environmental Law Center, George Wuerthner (as an individual), Footloose Montana, Native Ecosystems Council, Helena Hunters and Anglers Association, Wilderness Watch, Trap Free Montana, and Friends of the Clearwater.

Ron DeSantis. (Screenshot via the governor's X livestream)Candy for Valentine’s Day?
Maybe not.
The administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday that it had tested 46 types of candy and that more than 60% of them (28) contained elevated arsenic levels that, consumed over time, could put children at an increased risk of cancer. 
This is the second announcement this month the DeSantis administration has made about its testing efforts and the results being posted on the Healthy Florida First website. The governor and First Lady Casey DeSantis announced Florida had tested 24 infant formulas and found that 16 contained heavy metals or chemicals.
Those efforts followed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s, directive to the federal Food and Drug Administration to look at ingredients used in infant formula. Before he joined the administration of President Donald Trump, Kennedy promised to look at whether there were toxic metals in infant formula.
Although the DeSantis administration purports that 28 candies showed high levels of arsenic, the first lady stressed that not all test results were bad. For instance, she said none of the candy the state tested showed elevated levels of lead, mercury, cadmium, or “other problematic carcinogens.”
She also highlighted the candy that didn’t contain higher levels of arsenic, including Hershey Milk Chocolate Bar, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Whoppers, M&M’s, Twix, and Milky Way.

“Our goal really has been, as the governor has articulated, to support the federal [Make America Healthy Again] movement by working as force multipliers, to be able to drive accountability through testing,” she said Monday during a press conference at The Villages. 
“The [Food and Drug Administration] primarily works as a reactionary force, stepping in after problems are identified, and while that role is very important, Florida is really working to change the system by supporting the FDA to not only continue to get in front of these problems by testing, but also by leading a coalition of states to trust but verify the integrity of our food supply.”
Florida tests 24 formulas; purport that 16 have at least one heavy metal

Florida tested candy from 10 different manufacturers. The Florida Phoenix reached out to six of the companies for comment but none of them immediately responded.
Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo joined the governor and first lady at the press conference and thanked the pair for providing him with the support to conduct the tests. He also thanked them for having the “vision” to know the testing should be conducted.
“There’s a lot more to go. There’s plenty of dirt, unfortunately, to uncover,” Ladapo said.
Arsenic is a naturally occurring element. It is a confirmed carcinogen and long-term exposure can increase the risk of skin, bladder, lung, and liver cancer. Kidney and prostate cancers may also be tied to high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic is “everywhere” and “in all foods,” Ladapo said, but added that it tends to be in low concentrations.
“I was really shocked by the levels of arsenic in common candies, the levels of arsenic in common candies are much higher, two, three, four times higher than even foods that we know have high levels of arsenic in general, like rice,” Ladapo said. “And compared to foods, just typical foods that people eat, the levels of arsenic were 20, 30, 40, times higher. It’s just unbelievable.” 
While elevated arsenic levels in a single piece of candy may not be harmful, the first lady stressed that it becomes harmful when taken into context of how candy is marketed and consumed.
For example, she said, Nerds Grape and Nerds Strawberry candy both showed elevated arsenic levels. The DOH determined that a child could safely eat roughly 96 pieces of Nerds candy in a year with no worries. 
“But 96 Nerds, as we well know, is not typically what comes in a box. When you think about it, a typical smaller box can contain about 2,000. If you get one of those big boxes that you get, like a movie theater, that’s about 8,000 Nerds,” she said. “Asking families to stop at 96 pieces over a year is not realistic when it’s viewed against how the product is packaged, marketed, and then consumed.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-26-at-9.45.40-AM-1024x553.png,,,2026-01-26 13:57:12.861996

Dan McKeon of Amherst and his lawyer Perry Pirsch, not pictured, during an arraignment hearing at the Lancaster County Courthouse on Monday, Jan. 26, 2026, in Lincoln. (Kenneth Ferreria/Lincoln Journal Star)LINCOLN — Former State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst is sticking with his not guilty plea in court after resigning from the Nebraska Legislature to avoid the risk of being expelled.
A procedural hearing in Lancaster County Court on Monday set the date for McKeon’s bench trial for March 19. McKeon faces a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace, which comes with a maximum sentence of three months in jail, a $500 fine or both.
McKeon arrived late to his rescheduled hearing Monday after first trying to participate via Zoom from his attorney Perry Pirsch’s Lincoln office. Pirsch told Lancaster County Court Judge Matthew Acton that they intended to be there in person, but a prior Cass County Court case Pirsch was involved with was delayed.

Acton said parties must receive permission ahead of time to attend hearings using Zoom and ordered McKeon and Pirsch to travel to the courthouse before they proceeded.
“Court rules for both the district and county court states that all court hearings are presumed to be in person, sir,” Acton said. “And you did not ask for permission prior to appear via Zoom, so get down here.”
McKeon resigned from the Legislature this month minutes before debate was set to begin on a resolution to possibly expel him, which would have been a first in Nebraska history. He faced expulsion proceedings over allegations that he inappropriately touched a legislative staffer during an end-of-session party last year and what the Legislature’s Executive Board described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior,” based on the results of an internal investigation.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A separate criminal investigation after the incident led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency by the Nebraska State Patrol in October. Prosecutors have since charged him with misdemeanor disturbing the peace.
The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
McKeon missed his first court date in December. Pirsch said McKeon initially intended to plead no contest and sought to file that plea through a waiver, but Acton said that wasn’t allowed and ordered the arraignment be rescheduled for Monday and ordered McKeon to attend in person.
McKeon later changed his mind and pleaded not guilty in response to the Legislature’s Executive Board recommended he be expelled in a unanimous vote.
In a social media post Jan. 20, McKeon addressed his district saying that the process that led to his departure was “painful, frustrating, and at times unfairly portrayed in the headlines.”
“A series of political maneuvers reached a point that forced my resignation before an expulsion vote could occur,” McKeon said in a since-edited Facebook post.
McKeon had faced calls to resign since October when he was initially cited, including from Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials. McKeon said multiple times that he would not resign.
Multiple lawmakers — including one who supported McKeon — corroborated that there were enough votes to successfully expel McKeon, had the debate taken place. It takes 33 votes to expel a sitting senator.
The day after McKeon’s resignation, Pillen appointed State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul to represent District 41 in central Nebraska. Meyer had previously been appointed to the same seat by Pillen to replace Tom Briese, who resigned to serve as state treasurer.
Later this year, a special election will decide who serves the remaining two years of McKeon’s term. The Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office confirmed that no candidates have filed for that election as of Monday.

Carolyn Caiharr, an Edwardsville Republican, questioned a proponent of a bill that would allow lenders to charge a prepayment penalty to real estate investors. (Screen capture from the House Financial Institutes and Pensions Committee)TOPEKA — Real estate investors buying residential buildings in Kansas could be charged a penalty for paying off their mortgages early under proposed changes to the Kansas Contracts and Promises statute. 
The statute currently bars lenders from charging prepayment penalties on “any home loan” paid off after six months from the day the loan was taken out, the House Financial Institutions and Pensions Committee heard Monday. It doesn’t specify whether those loans are for individual homeowners or for real estate investors buying properties to rent or lease. 
House Bill 2497 would add language that allows lenders to charge prepayment penalties for investment properties but leave the ban in place for consumer personal loans.
Michael Stidham testified for Rocket Mortgage in favor of the bill, which he said would give investors more financing options. 
Rocket sets lower interest rates for loans that have a penalty for paying off early versus loans with no prepayment penalties, Stidham said. 
“A higher interest rate is always going to be required to offset the potential returns if that loan is paid off earlier than anticipated by the investor,” he said.
Allowing lenders to offer lower interest rates and include a prepayment penalty gives real estate investors flexibility to determine the best option for their financial situations, Stidham said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/House-finance-1-26-26-1024x612.png,,,2026-01-26 13:57:12.861996

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Upper Missouri Waterkeeper is again petitioning the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to list the Big Hole River as impaired in a letter submitted earlier this month.
The letter was submitted as a comment to the agency’s 2022-24 Draft Water Quality Integrated Report, which is a federally required process to determine where waterways are unhealthy and outline what’s being done about it.
While the Big Hole is not currently listed as “impaired,” other waterways in Montana are — about 11,000 miles of rivers and streams as well as 375,000 acres of lakes. Each of those rivers, streams or lakes has supporting documentation detailing why they’re considered impaired. Those problems can range from lack of clean drinking water to the health of fish living in the water.
“DEQ is actively reviewing and assessing mainstem Big Hole River data submitted by the petitioners. Some additional information requested from petitioners was received as recently as January 9,” DEQ spokesperson Madison McGeffers wrote in an email. “In addition, 2025 laboratory results from DEQ’s own monitoring were recently received and will be incorporated into the assessment after quality assurance checks are performed.”
In the letter, Waterkeeper says that the state isn’t using nutrient pollution and dissolved oxygen concentrations in their river assessments. Low oxygen levels can happen at night, which are sometimes caused by algae blooms. Most plants don’t photosynthesize and produce oxygen at night.
In the draft DEQ water report, oxygen concentrations are specifically addressed:
“DEQ also will not be including dissolved oxygen (DO) assessments during this Integrated Report. Upon initial implementation of a draft DO assessment method, DEQ identified many instances in which Montana’s DO standards do not fully account for natural variability in DO conditions, leading to potential impairment designations even in areas with little to no human influence.”
Waterkeeper and other organizations it has worked with have done extensive monitoring on the Big Hole River.
“Nothing is preventing local groups and residents from taking actions to address water quality issues in the Big Hole River watershed right now. The entire watershed is eligible for 319 funding (DEQ’s 2026 call for applications open through Feb. 20) to address nonpoint source pollution,” McGeffers wrote. “Thanks to previous monitoring and watershed restoration planning, DEQ and local partners have already identified nutrient issues in the greater Big Hole watershed and have a good understanding of pollution sources as well as the types of strategies that can be implemented to address them.”
Montana, following legislation passed in 2021, does not base nutrient assessments upon the numeric nutrient criteria, instead using what’s called “narrative standards,” which Waterkeeper says is less accurate. The Environmental Protection Agency rebuffed Montana’s use of narrative standards under the Biden administration, but it’s been implied this appears to have changed under the second Trump administration.
“We note the Department withheld publishing a draft 2022-24 Integrated Report until winter 2025/26, almost a full year after the 2024 field season and after EPA’s approval of Montana’s repeal of numeric nutrient standards,” the Waterkeeper letter reads. 
The DEQ’s assessments also do not include assessments of excessive algal growth, nitrate and nitrite, total nitrogen, as well as total phosphorus, the draft report states.
“DEQ has a mandatory duty under federal law to identify unhealthy waters based on available data,” Guy Alsentzer, executive director of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, said in a statement. “Instead of using existing, undisputed science to identify problems and initiate restoration planning for degraded waterways, the agency is pretending very real nutrient pollution problems don’t exist.”
The letter also states the agency’s actions on the Big Hole are “contrary” to the requirements of the Clean Water Act, saying it’s not assessing “nutrients and nutrient impairments.”
It goes on to say the Clean Water Act requires all currently available data be used.
“The Department’s refusal to assess our and others’ scientific evidence and make a determination of attainment or nonattainment in the Big Hole River — or any other river for which the Department possesses nutrient science — is unlawful, as it frustrates and undermines the purposes and intent of the CWA and Montana WQA, and citizens’ right to a clean and healthful environment under the state constitution,” the letter reads.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Senate President Ben Albritton was hospitalized overnight Sunday with a blood clot in his lung, his office announced Monday morning.
The Wauchula Republican, now in “good spirits,” began experiencing chest pains Sunday morning. He was taken to the emergency room at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, where physicians discovered a small blood clot in his lung.
“The President is in good spirits and has been in frequent communication with staff via phone and email yesterday and today,” the Senate’s office wrote in a statement. “All previously scheduled Senate business will proceed as planned this week.”
Although Albritton is still in the ER under observation and awaiting further testing, his office expects him to return to his office later this week.
The 57-year-old Senate president was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2010 and then to the Senate in 2018. In Oct. 2023, during the first Senate presidential term of Republican Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, Albritton was unanimously selected president-designate.
He took over the role in November 2024, presiding over his first session as president in the coming months. Albritton’s top priority legislation was a “Rural Renaissance” package designed to revitalize housing, education, healthcare, business, and agriculture in Florida’s farmlands.
Although it failed, the bundle has been resurrected for the 2026 session.
“The President and Mrs. Albritton are grateful to the physicians and staff at Tallahassee Memorial for the excellent care the President is receiving,” the statement continues. “He looks forward to returning to the office later this week. The President and Mrs. Albritton would be very grateful for your prayers.”
The Florida Senate is expected to hold a floor session on Thursday at 9 a.m. This is the only legislative meeting that Albritton presides over.

Kevin Stitt, is calling on the federal government to reassess their immigration enforcement policies. 
Stitt, chair of the National Governors Association, and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, vice chair of the organization, issued a joint statement Sunday calling for federal and state governments to work together and reset strategy following the death of a second Minnesotan by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

“As governors, we urge leaders at all levels to exercise wisdom and consider a reset of strategy toward a unified vision for immigration enforcement,” Stitt, a Republican, and Moore, a Democrat, said in a statement. “We believe there are criminals in our country who must be held accountable, but moments like this demand thoughtful leadership, coordination, and clarity. Scenes of violence and chaos on our streets are unacceptable and do not reflect who we are.”
Across the country, including in Oklahoma, the Trump administration has ramped up deportation efforts amid growing protests. The Trump administration has focused heavily on Minnesota, which officials have said has the “worst of the worst” criminals in the country illegally. The federal government has sent over 3,000 federal agents there, five times the number of Minneapolis police officers.
President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he is sending Tom Homan, the White House Border Czar, to Minneapolis. He also wrote that deportation efforts are going “peacefully and smoothly” in Republican-run cities and states, including Texas, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Louisiana. 
He said those states have had “zero protests, riots or chaos” because local police and ICE were “cooperating and working together.” Multiple media reports in those states show residents in those states are protesting immigration enforcement.
There have been three shootings by immigration officers in Minnesota in as many weeks, most recently on Saturday when 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti was killed.

The shootings have led to increased demonstrations and protests in Minnesota and in cities around the country. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said Pretti was armed and officers fired in an act of self-defense. Videos of the shooting, captured by bystanders, shows Pretti wrestled to the ground by multiple officers before more than 10 shots are fired. 
Minneapolis’ chief of police has said Pretti was a lawful gun owner.
Earlier in the month, authorities said ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good, 37, on Jan. 7 as Good was protesting. A week later, federal agents shot a Venezuelan man in the leg during what ICE called a “targeted traffic stop.”
Stitt and Moore, on behalf of the National Governors Association, asked for the federal government to work with state and local law enforcement with a “transparent strategy” and a unified approach. 
“Clarity of purpose is essential to maintaining public trust, ensuring accountability, and avoiding unintended escalation,” they said. “The use of federal authority should be guided by a transparent strategy that complements — rather than supplants — state and local efforts to uphold the law.
Stitt also said on CNN that the death of Americans causes “deep concern” and called the situation a tragedy. He said Americans “don’t like what they’re seeing right now.” 
“So what’s the goal right now,” he said. “Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want. We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.”

As a faculty member for 12 years and a North Carolina resident for more than 20, this delights me. I always recommend my home institution, NC State, but I’m enthusiastic about our entire system, rightly known as one of the best in the country. Our sixteen public universities offer comparatively lower tuition than neighboring states, and our extraordinary faculty include Nobel Prize winners, MacArthur Genius grantees, Pulitzer Prize winners, and more.
But a college education is still expensive — for most families, it’s like buying a new car every year for the next four years. Ideally, the expense will be worth it, launching students into financially, intellectually and culturally rewarding lives and careers.
But parents and students, would you knowingly buy a new car (or four new cars) with a failing engine?
As the president of the North Carolina Conference of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), I fear that unless we work to protect the academic freedom of our public universities, we may be asking you to do just that.
More than anything that draws students to our campuses — more than winning sports teams and fancy dining halls, state-of-the-art labs and well-stocked libraries — academic freedom is what makes our universities work. It is the engine of knowledge creation, creativity, and excellence.
Yet this engine is under more strain than ever before — almost all of it unnecessary. For UNC system professors, Trump’s second term began with savage and censorious DOGE cuts to the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Last spring and summer, right-wing activists ambushed our UNC campuses, targeting faculty and staff with secret recordings, and then pressured administration to fire staffers. Also last summer, our flagship institution delayed tenure votes for 33 faculty members, most of them in the humanities and social sciences, for no reason other than an objection to tenure itself. Then in December, UNC System President Peter Hans hastily announced a plan to make all our syllabi public records. Not only that, but UNC schools will also be forced to create a publicly searchable database of all of our syllabi, inviting right-wingers to target faculty for doxxing and harassment.
AAUP NC objects to and fights back against all of these attacks on academic freedom, and so should you.
We define academic freedom as “the freedom of a researcher in higher education to investigate and discuss the issues in his or her academic field, and teach or publish findings without interference from political figures, boards of trustees, donors or other entities.” Simply put, academic freedom is the freedom of teachers and researchers at colleges and universities to do the work of educating students and advancing knowledge in their fields.
It’s strongly connected to academic tenure, the indefinite appointment of faculty that happens after a set period of time, usually six years of excellent research and teaching. Tenure, which in the UNC system comes with a modest raise, allows faculty to expand their research, without fear of reprisal or job loss, in ways that are important to their department and university.
But academic freedom is also more than tenure — it’s also the freedom to discuss, without censorship, relevant issues in the classroom, to research and publish creative and scholarly work, and the freedom from institutional censorship when critiquing their institution or system (as in this op-ed) or other things happening in society. Like all freedoms, academic freedom calls for responsible and ethical use. Faculty must be respectful of the views of students as they guide their thinking, and model its responsible and ethical use.  
If you care about the reputation that backstops your child’s diploma, you should care about that institution’s commitment to academic freedom. North Carolina’s public universities have traditionally attracted some of the best professors and researchers in the world. Their work factors strongly into university rankings. These professors will not continue to come here — and, in fact, many will leave —  if they can’t access a fair and transparent tenure system, a university system invested in their protection, and university leaders unwilling to bend to politically-motivated demands.
And finally, do you want your child to finish their degree and leave the state, or to choose among opportunities offered by a thriving North Carolina economy? That’s also connected to academic freedom. UNC System schools contribute billions of dollars to our state’s economy, create thousands of jobs and hundreds of patents, attract start-ups and established companies to our state, and serve all of our one hundred counties through extension work in agriculture and healthcare, and through research and cultural programming.
As parents and prospective UNC system families, your voices matter. You can write directly to your chosen university’s admissions office. You can share your support for academic freedom — and your concerns about cuts, firings and tenure delays — through social media and parent networks. You can encourage your students to speak up, too — their voices are even more powerful, because their education is our core work and mission.
I hope your students get into their dream schools, and I also hope they know what makes those schools dreamed-of destinations in the first place. Let’s work together to protect academic freedom and keep our state universities healthy and thriving environments for all our students.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Paying ballot-question petition circulators would be prohibited in South Dakota by a bill the House State Affairs Committee approved Monday at the Capitol in Pierre.
Rep. Travis Ismay, R-Newell, introduced House Bill 1087 in response to several questions that appeared on the 2024 general election ballot with help from paid petition circulators.
“This bill that I am bringing honors the will of the people and not out-of-state interests,” Ismay said.
Petitioners in South Dakota need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to propose a law, which is known as an initiative, and the same number of signatures to put a bill passed by legislators on hold for consideration by voters, which is known as a referendum. The number of signatures required to propose a state constitutional amendment is 35,017.
Amid complaints about big-money ballot measures, new reports show $12 million spent in 2024

Under Ismay’s bill, if a court determines a campaign compensated a petition circulator — with money or gifts — the petition would be declared invalid. 
The bill passed with a 9-4 vote, which means it will go to the full House of Representatives.
Opponents said the bill would trigger a legal challenge if enacted and cost thousands of taxpayer dollars to defend. Opponents included the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, South Dakota Advocacy Network for Women, and the South Dakota Education Association.
Rep. Tim Reisch, R-Howard, echoed their concerns.
“We’re not going to give our teachers a pay raise, we’re out of money, and we’re going to pass a bill that we know is going to cost the taxpayers millions of dollars,” Reisch said. “I’m going to be a ‘no’ on this.”
Rep. Spencer Gosch, R-Glenham, said the cost of potential legal battles would be worth the attempt to level the playing field, rather than allowing the ballot measure process to be a “money game.”
“I am limiting one person’s ability to have more speech over mine just because they have more money,” Gosch said. “That one individual could hire multiple entities because they can afford to do so. I could not. Therefore, my vote is less important than their vote.”
The committee also approved Senate Bill 5, which would require the state attorney general’s official ballot-question explanations to include whether a ballot question was placed on the ballot by legislators or by citizen petitioners.

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Attorney Chris Madel released a blistering statement Monday about the federal government’s current surge of immigration officers as he announced he is dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination for Minnesota governor. 
Madel said in a video posted to X that he’s dropping out, in part, because he can’t stand by the Republican Party’s support of the federal immigration crackdown in Minnesota, where many U.S. citizens  walk the streets in fear and carry documentation to prove their citizenship. 
“I cannot support the national Republican’s stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so,” Madel said, whose defense of a state trooper charged with murder raised his profile in recent years. “Operation Metro Surge has expanded far beyond its stated focus on true public safety threats.” 
His statement underscores the increasing unease Minnesota Republicans — which now includes several swing-district lawmakers — are expressing about the surge of federal officers.
In recent weeks, Madel has performed well in local GOP party straw polls, especially for a candidate with little name recognition and no political experience. Madel pitched himself as a political outsider who could win voters over using the communication skills he’s developed from his decades as a defense attorney.
Madel’s announcement comes after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday — the third shooting by immigration officers in three weeks and the second to end in death. The Trump administration has called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” who wanted to physically harm law enforcement. Videos taken at the scene belie the Trump administration’s claims. 
In the video announcing the suspension of his campaign, Madel criticized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s use of administrative warrants, which do not require a judge’s sign-off, to unlawfully enter people’s homes and “weaponizing criminal investigations against political opponents.”
“I personally have spoken to several law enforcement officers, some Hispanic and some Asian, who have been pulled over by ICE on pretextual stops. Driving while Hispanic is not a crime, neither is driving while Asian,” Madel said. “At the end of the day, I have to look my daughters in the eye and tell them, ‘I believe I did what was right,’ and I am doing that today.” 
Madel represented State Patrol Officer Ryan Londregan, who was charged with murder and manslaughter after he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II in 2023. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty wound up dropping the charges against Londregan.
Earlier this month, Madel provided legal counsel to Jonathan Ross, the federal agent who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good.
In addition to his criticism of Operation Metro Surge, Madel said he was dropping out because “national Republicans have made it nearly impossible for a Republican to win.” 
Madel said he doesn’t believe President Donald Trump has been given enough credit, including negotiating a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza. He also criticized Minnesota Republicans for failing to properly investigate fraud in the state’s public programs.
Madel said he will return all the donations made to his campaign for governor.
“God bless you, and God bless Minnesota,” Madel concluded. “We certainly need it.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/P1163918-scaled-e1764617500172-1024x635.jpg,,,2026-01-26 11:58:05.727687

Gov. Tate Reeves on Tuesday will deliver his State-of-the-State Address.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The focus of the 2026 Mississippi legislative session so far has been the gulf between Republican House and Senate leaders over school choice, or, more pointedly, the House proposal to spend millions of tax dollars on private schooling.
Senate leaders vow opposition to the omnibus House Bill 2 because of this facet. But House Bill 2 is a kitchen-sink measure, with many other education proposals thrown in. And, it would appear, the Senate leadership is open to many of these. Its education panel passed a slew of them in separate bills on to the full Senate last week. These include measures to expand the state’s successful literacy and math programs into higher grades, promote prayer in school and allow homeschooled children to play in public school sports. And as for school choice, both chambers appear onboard with allowing public school students to switch schools or districts more easily.
But will the standoff over private-school vouchers prevent agreement on other measures? A full-court political press is on. Local governments and school officials continue to lobby against HB2, while some apparently well-funded and organized proponents are sending out robo-texts to constituents in home districts of Republican lawmakers who oppose the measure. Even the White House has been applying pressure on Mississippi Republicans for passage of the voucher measure.
Otherwise, lawmakers face a busy couple of weeks, with key deadlines approaching. Importantly, a first major “killing deadline,” one that will likely weed out hundreds of bills, is Feb. 3, the deadline for committees to pass or kill bills from their own chamber. 
Other major debates to watch this session are:

Ballot initiative. This has become a perennial issue since the state Supreme Court nullified this right for Mississippi voters in 2021. Lawmakers can’t seem to get together on the particulars, although many proclaim they want to restore voters’ ability to sidestep the Legislature and put measures to a statewide vote. The 2027 state elections loom, and lawmakers face pressure to resolve this before reelection time.


Online sports betting. This is a major House initiative, and its leaders have tried to sweeten the pot for a reluctant Senate, proposing to earmark tax revenue from mobile gambling to shore up the state’s government employee retirement system.


Campaign-finance reform. Another perennial issue facing more urgency with the 2027 elections looming, the state’s lax, confusing, conflicting and often unenforced campaign-finance laws leave our elections open to an unchecked flow of dark money and special interest influence. But it appears two main players in potential reform, the secretary of state and attorney general, are getting on the same page.

Quote of the Week

“I do have a little problem, Mr. House Speaker. In fact, I’ve got three problems … I’ve got a problem with my woman, with my girlfriend and with my wife …” — famed blues musician Bobby Rush, who gave an impromptu singing and harmonica performance on the House floor on Tuesday.

In Brief
Prison health reform proposed
A slate of bills from House Corrections Chair Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, would revamp the delivery of health care in state prisons.
The proposals come after Mississippi Today’s “Behind Bars, Beyond Care” series, which has documented the alleged routine denial of health care in state prisons and deadly outcomes.
Currie’s bills would establish a corrections ombudsman to investigate health care complaints, establish hepatitis C and HIV treatment programs, provide kiosks for prisoners to request medical attention and require correctional officers to wear body cameras. But most of the bills have been double-referred, meaning they would have to pass through two committees. That’s sometimes a sign that a bill doesn’t have the support of a chamber’s leadership. – Michael Goldberg
Bill would provide benefits for gig workers
A growing number of Americans are working as independent contractors and “gig” workers. 
They often do not receive employer-provided benefits such as health care and retirement.
House Bill 1072, the “Voluntary Portable Benefit Plan,” aims to help these workers access benefits. Authored by Rep. Lee Yancey, a Republican from Brandon, the bill would create a separate type of benefit that follows workers across jobs. A hiring firm could make tax-deductible contributions to the account and it would not be counted as taxable income for the worker. Similar portable-benefit accounts have been created in other states, such as Alabama and Tennessee. – Katherine Lin
Gov. Reeves to deliver State of the State address
Gov. Tate Reeves will deliver his State of the State Address to a joint session of the Mississippi Legislature on Tuesday.
The address, which will be aired live by Mississippi Public Broadcasting, will be delivered at 5 p.m. in the second-floor rotunda at the state Capitol. Read a transcript of Reeves’ 2025 address here. – Mississippi Today
DeSoto board wants power to remove member
HERNANDO — Some DeSoto County School Board members want a legal process by which an elected school board member could be ousted for concerns including malfeasance and abuse of power. They passed a resolution in November formally asking lawmakers to consider granting that authority in the current legislative session.
Sen. Kevin Blackwell, a Republican from Southaven, has filed Senate Bill 2068, which would allow a school district’s local governing authority, by majority vote, to remove a school board member for breach of public trust, neglect of duty and abuse of authority. The school board would first have to vote on a recommendation.
Rep. Kimberly Remak, a Republican from Olive Branch, is the primary author of House Bill 573, the House mirror of Blackwell’s bill.  – Leonardo Bevilacqua
Earlier teacher procurement cards proposed
The Senate Education Committee on Thursday passed a bill that would distribute procurement cards, which teachers use to pay for classroom supplies, in July instead of August.
A report from the state Auditor’s office last summer showed that the card is activated too late to be useful, and that many teachers are forced to spend their own money on supplies.
The cards provide every teacher $748.
Sen. Scott DeLano, a Republican from Biloxi, said the new date would be tight, given that the state’s fiscal year starts in July. But he said the change is necessary because school districts are starting earlier and earlier. – Devna Bose
Bill would prohibit secret government settlements
Sen. Angela Hill, a Republican from Picayune, filed a bill that would prohibit government bodies from entering into private settlements and ban judges from sealing settlements, especially if they involve tax money. 
Hill told Mississippi Today that the legislation is about promoting transparency and allowing the public to know if taxpayer dollars are paying settlements. She said government bodies can redact the identities of people involved, if necessary. 
“We’re not talking about making private identities public — this is talking about tax dollars,” Hill said.  – Taylor Vance
Truancy officers would see pay raise
A bill pending before the Senate would give truancy officers a significant pay increase.
School attendance officers, under current law, are paid at least $24,000 a year. The new bill would raise the minimum by $10,000.
The bill also expands the responsibilities of attendance officers to dropout prevention and establishes a more robust framework to combat absenteeism, an issue that Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann has said is one of his top priorities.
Chronic absenteeism, or missing at least 10% of a school year, has more than doubled in Mississippi since 2018. – Devna Bose
Boyd wants local governments to livestream
The Senate Government Structure Committee last week advanced a bill that would require all government bodies in the state to livestream meetings and post agendas on their website. 
Sen. Nicole Boyd, a Republican from Oxford, filed the legislation and told Mississippi Today that requiring public bodies to do this would not cost them a significant amount of money and should not be a significant burden on them because several agencies and local governments already do this. 
“It’s important for everyday citizens to find out what’s going on in our local boards and commissions,” Boyd said. – Taylor Vance
By the Numbers
$100 million
Amount the University of Mississippi Medical Center is asking the Legislature to provide for what hospital officials hope will become a “gold standard” cancer center. UMMC has already raised $90 million of the estimated $250 million total cost.

Sherrill says impeachment of U.S. homeland security chief ‘has to happen immediately’,Sophie Nieto-Munoz,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/sherrill-homeland-security-impeachment/,"Gov. Mikie Sherrill said the Trump administration is ""wholesale lying"" to Americans about the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis nurse.","Gov. Mikie Sherrill said the Trump administration is ""wholesale lying"" to Americans about the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis nurse. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Mikie Sherrill on Monday called for Congress to “immediately” impeach U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the wake of the fatal shooting of a Minnesota man by a border patrol agent.
The comments from New Jersey’s Democratic governor, who took office last week, come one day after Nevada Sen. U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen (D) called for Noem’s impeachment.
“I think that has to happen immediately,” Sherrill said in an interview with WNYC. “There needs to be a stand-down from duty, because all of these agents are acting completely outside the scope of their duties. It’s dangerous, and it should not be acceptable to anyone — Democrat, Republican alike, should all be calling for this to end immediately.”
Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse from Minneapolis, was shot dead Saturday during an altercation with federal immigration agents, marking the second fatal shooting by agents this month in Minneapolis. The Minnesota city has been flooded with immigration agents as part of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort.
After Murphy, some lawmakers want limits on clemency powers

Noem alleged that Pretti approached agents with a gun to “inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,” and an agent shot and killed Pretti in an act of self-defense. Videos of the episode appear to show an agent disarming Pretti before another agent shoots him multiple times. Minneapolis officials have said Pretti was legally allowed to be carrying a firearm.
Sherrill in her WNYC interview accused the Trump administration of “wholesale lying to American people, making up stories about the people that this police force is killing on the streets.”
“Make no mistake, if you look at that video, it is hard to escape the understanding that that was a crime committed by that police force,” she said. “There’s no accountability. They are completely backed up by the president’s administration in their wrongdoing in their actions against the American people.”
Immigrant advocates in New Jersey have been pushing the Legislature to pass a package of bills aimed at limiting when local law enforcement and other public officials can cooperate with federal immigration agents. Sherrill’s predecessor, Phil Murphy, signed one of the bills last week but vetoed two others before leaving office, saying he worried they would conflict with federal law or leave the state open to legal challenges.
The advocates are now hoping the Legislature will advance the two vetoed bills and send them to Sherrill for her signature. It’s unclear whether she supports them.
One of the bills would codify the Immigrant Trust Directive, a state attorney general order from 2018 that restricts state and local cooperation with immigration agents.

The day after federal immigration agents fatally shot Minneapolis protestor Alex Pretti, Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott condemned the violence of federal immigration agents. 
“Enough…it’s not acceptable for American citizens to be killed by federal agents for exercising their God-given and constitutional rights to protest their government,” he said in a statement Sunday. 
On Saturday, federal agents in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse who was protesting President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good in the city.
In the wake of Pretti’s killing, video analyses by national media have contradicted the claims of federal officials, who asserted that officers shot Pretti in self-defense after he approached officers with a firearm. Video footage shows that Pretti approached the officers holding his phone — not a gun. 
In videos of the scene, half a dozen officers wrestled Pretti to the ground in tactical gear. Though Pretti did have a semiautomatic pistol on him, officials said he was licensed to carry it. And videos show that officers knocked away his gun before fatally shooting him. Pretti was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, according to the Minneapolis police chief. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security called its crackdown in the city the largest immigration operation in the department’s history earlier this month, marking a significant escalation since first targeting Somali immigrants in December. 
In his statement, Scott called on Trump to change course in Minnesota. 
“The President should pause these operations, de-escalate the situation, and reset the federal government’s focus on truly criminal illegal immigrants. In the absence of Presidential action, Congress and the Courts must step up to restore constitutionality,” he said. 
The two most recent killings of U.S. citizens in Minnesota are far from the first violent incidents involving federal immigration agents. Immigration agents also shot and wounded two people in Oregon, fatally shot one person in Chicago and shot at least eight civilians in vehicles since July. 
“At best, these federal immigration operations are a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices, training, and leadership,” Scott said. “At worst, it’s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that’s resulting in the murder of Americans. Again, enough is enough.”

All across the country, ICE and Border Patrol agents have conducted police-state-style raids and other actions that have terrorized communities and raised constitutional issues of profound importance.
At the same time, numerous changes to immigration policy – many of them adopted without public knowledge or input – have made an already complex system more opaque and confusing than ever.
At such a challenging moment, the nation is blessed to have a small and courageous cadre of nonprofit advocates who work each day to monitor and shine a light on the system and advocate for basic American values like due process. And recently Newsline got a chance to talk with one of the most able and best-informed attorneys working in this arena, American Immigration Council Deputy Legal Director, Raul Pinto.
In Part One of our recent extended conversation with American Immigration Council Deputy Legal Director, Raul Pinto, we delved into some of the most worrisome front burner issues related to immigrants and immigration policy currently afflicting the nation – including the deeply disturbing mass raids, arrests and violence launched by the Trump administration in numerous communities across the country.
In Part Two of our chat, we dug deeper into some of these and related issues, including the matter of transparency and accountability in the immigration law system and an ongoing effort by Pinto and his colleagues to compel the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to simply provide immigrants with their own immigration records.

(Kentucky Transportation Cabinet photo)Kentucky officials are investigating three deaths that may be related to the weekend’s severe snow and ice. 
In a Monday morning press conference, Gov. Andy Beshear said at least one fatality may be a result of running a generator indoors. 
“Check on your neighbors, just make sure they’re OK,” the governor said. “What a good time to live out the parable of The Good Samaritan. All it takes is a phone call or knocking on their door, just see if they’re all right.” 
Beshear also emphasized that Kentuckians should use caution when shoveling snow, as the activity can increase risk of heart attacks. Last year, six Kentuckians died while shoveling snow.
Over the weekend, Kentucky was blanketed with snow and ice, making roads hazardous and causing power outages. Beshear said the state was down to 47,123 power outages from 73,590 at the height of the storm Sunday. 
For the week ahead, Kentucky is forecasted to have extremely cold temperatures. Beshear said that wind chills as low as negative 20 degrees statewide are expected. 
“Tomorrow morning is going to be the worst. It is going to be dangerously cold,” the governor said. “Tomorrow morning being outside for just 10 to 30 minutes could result in hypothermia or frostbite, so we need everyone to take precautions.” 
The Kentucky General Assembly had canceled its meetings Monday because of the weather. All eight of Kentucky’s public universities canceled classes or moved to online instruction options. 
Beshear said in his briefing that while all Kentucky counties had “major impacts,” Barren, Pulaski, Allen and Monroe counties were among the hardest hit by the storm. 
A few hundred Kentuckians are being sheltered, the governor added, and that number is being updated as more people are transported to assistance. About 150 people were evacuated from London hotels without power. Some guests were also evacuated from Barren River State Park. 
Secondary roads across the state were “still impassable,” as of Monday morning, Beshear said. While interstates had “significant process,” he continued, drivers should slow down while traveling.. 
Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray said a tractor-trailer had jackknifed on I-75 southbound near Clays Ferry Bridge, which is between Madison and Fayette counties. Information on injuries was not immediately available. 
“Our focus today is on priority routes, crossovers, ramps, turn lanes and secondaries,” Gray said of the road crews’ plans for Monday. “We’re taking advantage of what sunlight we have before the onset of this bitter and brutal cold tonight.” 
On Saturday, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for several states, including Kentucky, due to the weather. Beshear declared a state of emergency for Kentucky Friday. 
In light of the weather, Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office is taking reports of suspected price gouging at its hotline, 1-888-432-9257, or online. 
Kentuckians should call 911 in emergencies or life-threatening situations. If someone has immediate needs that aren’t life-threatening, like little to no heat or phone issues, they can complete the online Rapid Needs Assessment Form or call 502-607-6665.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-26 15:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump administration plans to write regulations using Artificial Intelligence,Jesse Coburn | ProPublica,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/trump-administration-plans-to-write-regulations-using-artificial-intelligence/,"The Transportation Department, which oversees the safety of airplanes, cars and pipelines, plans to use Google Gemini to draft new regulations.","This story was originally published by ProPublica.
The Trump administration is planning to use artificial intelligence to write federal transportation regulations, according to U.S. Department of Transportation records and interviews with six agency staffers.
The plan was presented to DOT staff last month at a demonstration of AI’s “potential to revolutionize the way we draft rulemakings,” agency attorney Daniel Cohen wrote to colleagues. The demonstration, Cohen wrote, would showcase “exciting new AI tools available to DOT rule writers to help us do our job better and faster.”
Discussion of the plan continued among agency leadership last week, according to meeting notes reviewed by ProPublica. Gregory Zerzan, the agency’s general counsel, said at that meeting that President Donald Trump is “very excited about this initiative.” Zerzan seemed to suggest that the DOT was at the vanguard of a broader federal effort, calling the department the “point of the spear” and “the first agency that is fully enabled to use AI to draft rules.”
Zerzan appeared interested mainly in the quantity of regulations that AI could produce, not their quality. “We don’t need the perfect rule on XYZ. We don’t even need a very good rule on XYZ,” he said, according to the meeting notes. “We want good enough.” Zerzan added, “We’re flooding the zone.” 
These developments have alarmed some at DOT. The agency’s rules touch virtually every facet of transportation safety, including regulations that keep airplanes in the sky, prevent gas pipelines from exploding and stop freight trains carrying toxic chemicals from skidding off the rails. Why, some staffers wondered, would the federal government outsource the writing of such critical standards to a nascent technology notorious for making mistakes?
The answer from the plan’s boosters is simple: speed. Writing and revising complex federal regulations can take months, sometimes years. But, with DOT’s version of Google Gemini, employees could generate a proposed rule in a matter of minutes or even seconds, two DOT staffers who attended the December demonstration remembered the presenter saying. In any case, most of what goes into the preambles of DOT regulatory documents is just “word salad,” one staffer recalled the presenter saying. Google Gemini can do word salad.
Zerzan reiterated the ambition to accelerate rulemaking with AI at the meeting last week. The goal is to dramatically compress the timeline in which transportation regulations are produced, such that they could go from idea to complete draft ready for review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in just 30 days, he said. That should be possible, he said, because “it shouldn’t take you more than 20 minutes to get a draft rule out of Gemini.”
The DOT plan, which has not previously been reported, represents a new front in the Trump administration’s campaign to incorporate artificial intelligence into the work of the federal government. This administration is not the first to use AI; federal agencies have been gradually stitching the technology into their work for years, including to translate documents, analyze data and categorize public comments, among other uses. But the current administration has been particularly enthusiastic about the technology. Trump released multiple executive orders in support of AI last year. In April, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought circulated a memo calling for the acceleration of its use by the federal government. Three months later, the administration released an “AI Action Plan” that contained a similar directive. None of those documents, however, called explicitly for using AI to write regulations, as DOT is now planning to do.
Those plans are already in motion. The department has used AI to draft a still-unpublished Federal Aviation Administration rule, according to a DOT staffer briefed on the matter.
Skeptics say that so-called large language models such as Gemini and ChatGPT shouldn’t be trusted with the complicated and consequential responsibilities of governance, given that those models are prone to error and incapable of human reasoning. But proponents see AI as a way to automate mindless tasks and wring efficiencies out of a slow-moving federal bureaucracy.
Such optimism was on display in a windowless conference room in Northern Virginia earlier this month, where federal technology officials, convened at an AI summit, discussed adopting an “AI culture” in government and “upskilling” the federal workforce to use the technology. Those federal representatives included Justin Ubert, division chief for cybersecurity and operations at DOT’s Federal Transit Administration, who spoke on a panel about the Transportation Department’s plans for “fast adoption” of artificial intelligence. Many people see humans as a “choke point” that slows down AI, he noted. But eventually, Ubert predicted, humans will fall back into merely an oversight role, monitoring “AI-to-AI interactions.” Ubert declined to speak to ProPublica on the record.
A similarly sanguine attitude about the potential of AI permeated the presentation at DOT in December, which was attended by more than 100 DOT employees, including division heads, high-ranking attorneys and civil servants from rulemaking offices. Brimming with enthusiasm, the presenter told them that Gemini can handle 80% to 90% of the work of writing regulations, while DOT staffers could do the rest, one attendee recalled the presenter saying.
To illustrate this, the presenter asked for a suggestion from the audience of a topic on which DOT may have to write a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, a public filing that lays out an agency’s plans to introduce a new regulation or change an existing one. He then plugged the topic keywords into Gemini, which produced a document resembling a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. It appeared, however, to be missing the actual text that goes into the Code of Federal Regulations, one staffer recalled.
The presenter expressed little concern that the regulatory documents produced by AI could contain so-called hallucinations — erroneous text that is frequently generated by large language models such as Gemini — according to three people present. In any case, that’s where DOT’s staff would come in, he said. “It seemed like his vision of the future of rulemaking at DOT is that our jobs would be to proofread this machine product,” one employee said. “He was very excited.” (Attendees could not clearly recall the name of the lead presenter, but three said they believed it was Brian Brotsos, the agency’s acting chief AI officer. Brotsos declined to comment, referring questions to the DOT press office.)
A spokesperson for the DOT did not respond to a request for comment; Cohen and Zerzan also did not respond to messages seeking comment. A Google spokesperson did not provide a comment.
The December presentation left some DOT staffers deeply skeptical. Rulemaking is intricate work, they said, requiring expertise in the subject at hand as well as in existing statutes, regulations and case law. Mistakes or oversights in DOT regulations could lead to lawsuits or even injuries and deaths in the transportation system. Some rule writers have decades of experience. But all that seemed to go ignored by the presenter, attendees said. “It seems wildly irresponsible,” said one, who, like the others, requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. 
Mike Horton, DOT’s former acting chief artificial intelligence officer, criticized the plan to use Gemini to write regulations, comparing it to “having a high school intern that’s doing your rulemaking.” (He said the plan was not in the works when he left the agency in August.) Noting the life-or-death stakes of transportation safety regulations, Horton said the agency’s leaders “want to go fast and break things, but going fast and breaking things means people are going to get hurt.”
Academics and researchers who track the use of AI in government expressed mixed opinions about the DOT plan. If agency rule writers use the technology as a sort of research assistant with plenty of supervision and transparency, it could be useful and save time. But if they cede too much responsibility to AI, that could lead to deficiencies in critical regulations and run afoul of a requirement that federal rules be built on reasoned decision-making.
“Just because these tools can produce a lot of words doesn’t mean that those words add up to a high-quality government decision,” said Bridget Dooling, a professor at Ohio State University who studies administrative law. “It’s so tempting to try to figure out how to use these tools, and I think it would make sense to try. But I think it should be done with a lot of skepticism.”
Ben Winters, the AI and privacy director at the Consumer Federation of America, said the plan was especially problematic given the exodus of subject-matter experts from government as a result of the administration’s cuts to the federal workforce last year. DOT has had a net loss of nearly 4,000 of its 57,000 employees since Trump returned to the White House, including more than 100 attorneys, federal data shows.
Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency was a major proponent of AI adoption in government. In July, The Washington Post reported on a leaked DOGE presentation that called for using AI to eliminate half of all federal regulations, and to do so in part by having AI draft regulatory documents. “Writing is automated,” the presentation read. DOGE’s AI program “automatically drafts all submission documents for attorneys to edit.” DOGE and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
The White House did not answer a question about whether the administration is planning to use AI in rulemaking at other agencies as well. Four top technology officials in the administration said they were not aware of any such plan. As for DOT’s “point of the spear” claim, two of those officials expressed skepticism. “There’s a lot of posturing of, ‘We want to seem like a leader in federal AI adoption,’” one said. “I think it’s very much a marketing thing.”

Maura Healey's 2026 State of the Commonwealth speech. They compare her tone and policy position to earlier years, review reactions to the speech, and look ahead at what this says about Healey's run for reelection.","EPISODE INFO
HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Chris Lisinski






MAURA HEALEY’S FINAL State of the Commonwealth speech in her first term as governor, delivered last Thursday, had to do several things: burnish her record as she runs for re-election, reassure the state that she has made progress on systems in crisis like housing and transportation, roll out a few policy proposals, and set the stage for a year of unpredictable federal actions after President Trump spent his first year back in office taking direct shots at Massachusetts priority areas like green energy and higher education. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon senior reporters Chris Lisinski and Jennifer Smith dig into Healey’s speech, comparing the governor’s tone and policy position to earlier years, reviewing reactions to it, and looking ahead at what it says about Healey’s second run for the corner office. 
Affordability was the theme of the evening, but Healey also devoted a good chunk of the speech to taking aim at Trump and the impact his policies are having on the state.  
“The first and most striking thing for myself, and frankly, I think most of the other attendees and those in the press corps, was not so much about policy or promises, but about tone,” Lisinski said. After a year of Trump’s “never-ending stream of impacts causing headaches for Massachusetts,” Healey’s speech was a departure from her 2025 State of the Commonwealth, delivered days before Trump’s return to office, in which the governor did not say his name once.  
This year, Lisinski noted, “She really sought to contrast herself from the federal government, and to pitch Massachusetts as, I guess, a bulwark or a shield against overreach by the Trump administration.” 
While groups including Planned Parenthood lauded the governor for her commitment to reproductive choice, progressives bristled at the lack of specific policy promises to address what Healey described as needlessly aggressive US Immigration and Customs Enforcement action chilling entire communities.   
Jonathan Cohn, policy director of Progressive Massachusetts, said after the speech that “the governor offered nothing. Let’s be clear: reining in ICE violence is a kitchen table [matter], as there is no such thing as affordability when families are being broken apart and workers are being kidnapped on the way to work.” 
On affordability, Republican gubernatorial hopefuls savaged Healey’s plan to reduce utility bills during the costly heating season, which depends in large part on utility companies simply delaying payments until spring and summer. 
“Gov. Healey’s ‘plan’ for energy relief is basically a payday loan scam,” Mike Kennealy said in his response. He called the speech a “masterclass in political spin” and slammed Healey’s commitment to a “climate agenda” that he blamed for the state’s high utility rates.  
On energy, Healey touted the now-operational high-voltage transmission line bringing hydroelectricity from Quebec into the Bay State. But Smith noted the absence of comment on wind power, after the governor in 2024 touted the state as “leading the clean energy revolution” with the Vineyard Wind project and looked ahead at reviewing offshore wind proposals that “could equal up to 25 percent of our energy needs.”  
Trump has identified offshore wind as a target, halting construction on major projects by citing national security concerns and throwing offshore wind plans across New England coasts into limbo. 
“Those sorts of pivots aren’t always apparent in the speech itself in front of you,” Smith said of the governor’s wind omission this year and last, “but when you can track it year over year, you can tell that since 2024, Healey has sort of seen that it’s going to become a lot harder to promise wind projects going forward.” 
Healey gestured at the difficult path ahead, even while declaring the state of the Commonwealth to be strong, saying there’s “no doubt it may get worse before it gets better.” Her plans to “do what we have to do to make it better” should come into sharper relief this week as the governor rolls out her annual budget proposal.  
On the episode, Lisinski and Smith discuss the governor’s posture on Trump (5:00), her housing promises (13:00), and what the speech teased about Healey’s upcoming budget filing (32:00).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 10:58:51.209138

(Photo: Nevada Gold Mines presentation to investors)The price of an ounce of gold traded for more than $5,000 an ounce for the first time in history Monday.
The milestone was the latest in a series for precious metal markets that have been on a tear. Less than a year ago, in March, gold’s price surpassed $3,000 an ounce. Then it broke the $4,000 threshold in October.
The price of silver, which increased by an even larger percentage than gold in 2025, has also continued to soar in 2026, and topped $100 an ounce Friday.
Since the start of the year the price of gold has increased by 17%, and silver’s climb continues to outpace it, rising 55% since January 1.
Nevada is the nation’s largest gold producer, and the second largest producer of silver, after Alaska.
The rush to precious metals over the last year has been attributed to a so-called “sell America” trade wherein investors are seeking shelter amid geopolitical volatility, fear of inflation, and the declining value of the world’s dominant currency, the U.S. dollar, which dipped to a four-month low early Monday.
Financial market nervousness has only been heightened so far in 2026 by a steady stream of tumult, including Donald Trump rupturing relations with Europe with his intentions to gobble Greenland, his continuing on-again off-again tariff threats, and his Department of Justice launching an investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as part of Trump’s effort to effectively seize personal control of the the world’s most powerful central bank and with it, the power to set U.S. interest rates.
The share prices of Nevada’s largest mining corporations were also boosted in early trading Monday. That too is a continuation of last year, when global economic anxiety helped Newmont Corp.’s share price to soar by more than 180%, and Barrick Mining Corp’s to shoot up more than 200%. Newmont stock is already up 26% since the start of the new year, while Barrick’s was up slightly more than 20% year to date as of Monday morning.
Barrick is the operator of Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture with Newmont. Last year, the venture accounted for more than two-thirds of the gold mined in Nevada.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-3-10-25-at-5.49-PM-1024x612.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 10:58:51.209138

Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh after a hearing on Wednesday promised he would rule by Feb. 10 on whether to issue a preliminary injunction to block elections on property tax caps that must be held in April in 97 counties.
A second hearing in the case, originally filed by two taxpayers, six school districts and a fire district, will be held next week as attorneys for the plaintiffs seek a summary judgment in their favor.
And in a Jan. 16 decision certain to be appealed, Limbaugh denied standing — the right to sue — and dismissed a case brought by two lawmakers and a conservative activist arguing the wide-ranging legislation violated procedural rules for passing bills.
The bill approved by lawmakers in a June special session offered up to $1.5 billion in incentives to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals in Missouri. It also expanded a program of tax credits as an incentive for major amateur sports competitions, offered tax credits for disaster relief and set the property tax caps in 97 of the state’s 114 counties.
In 75 counties, voter approval would limit future increases in tax property tax bills to 5% or the rate of inflation, whichever is greater. For 22 counties, voter approval would mean individual property tax bills could not increase.
The tax base would be reset when a property changes hands. The caps allow tax bills to increase when a new or increased tax is approved by voters.
Feb. 10 is a key date because that is when April ballots must be certified by local election authorities. Twenty-seven counties joined the lawsuit after it was filed, arguing that the cost of the election is an unfunded mandate that violates the Missouri Constitution.
Attorney Jim Layton, who represents several of the original plaintiffs, said Limbaugh must decide whether the property tax caps are improperly passed special laws or violate constitutional provisions requiring uniformity in taxation and equal rights.
Lawmakers opted their counties into the legislation during a late-night floor session, deciding what level of relief they wanted for their area. Many of the state’s largest counties were excluded, leaving Boone, Greene, Jackson, St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis out of the law.
“There’s no rational basis for the lines that it drew, or for designating some counties, particular counties, as 0% or 5% or unaffected counties,” Layton said in an interview with The Independent.
The state is defending the law by saying it will provide cover to local assessors who have been reluctant to bring property values up to the current market because of its impact on tax bills, Layton said.
Neither the original plaintiffs nor the intervening counties challenging the tax caps are asking Limbaugh to throw out the entire law. That was the goal of the lawsuit that was dismissed Jan. 16, filed by state Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, and state Rep. Bryant Wolfin, a Republican from Ste. Genevieve, and Ron Calzone, a conservative activist who has challenged several laws for violating procedural rules in the Missouri Constitution. 
Moon and Wolfin “claim that they have legislative standing to challenge (the law, but) this court is unaware of any Missouri statute or case law conferring such standing upon petitioners Moon and Wolfin,” Limbaugh wrote.
Calzone, who claimed standing as a taxpayer who would be damaged by having public funds spent, failed in that argument, Limbaugh wrote. Tax credits to promote major amateur sporting events are not a “direct expenditure to be made by the state,” and payments for bonds on stadiums are subject to appropriation, which means they are not automatic.
“There is no ‘direct expenditure of funds generated through taxation’ that could confer taxpayer standing,” Limbaugh wrote.
Calzone, in an interview, said Limbaugh made a mistake because the tax credits for amateur sporting events are refundable — meaning the state will write a check if the credits exceed what the taxpayer owes the state.
The ruling also cited an incorrect version of the law on amateur sporting event tax credits, he said. The section cited is the one that existed, with lower credit amounts, before the special session law was enacted.
The options for the plaintiffs are to ask Limbaugh to reconsider based on what they believe are errors in the decision or take the case to higher courts on appeal, Calzone said.
“That is something we are still trying to determine,” he said. “But absolutely, one way or another, we will end up in the Missouri Supreme Court.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_colecountycourt2-scaled-e1757967844893-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-26 10:58:51.209138

Tim Walz, a Democrat with whom the president has often clashed, around midday Monday.“It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” Trump said of the conversation. “The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future. He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during an afternoon briefing that Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol commander-at-large, would “continue to lead” immigration agents across the country, but did not address whether he would be active in Minneapolis once Homan arrived. CNN reported Monday afternoon  Bovino and some of his agents were set to depart the city. Homan “has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there,” Trump wrote on social media. “Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.”Leavitt repeated throughout a 20-minute White House press briefing the administration’s position that Democratic state and local officials were responsible for the situation in Minneapolis, but declined to endorse the harshest descriptions of Pretti that administration leaders, including top White House aide Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, have used.Border czarEarly in his second administration, Trump tasked Homan with carrying out the president’s mass deportation campaign, which has faced significant pushback in Minneapolis.Homan, who is expected to be in Minnesota by the evening, is the former ICE head of removal operations during the Obama administration and served as acting ICE director during the first Trump administration. Leavitt said Monday that Homan will be “the point person for cooperating with state and local authorities in corresponding with them, again, to achieve this level of cooperation to subdue the chaos on the streets of Minneapolis.”Homan’s arrival comes while thousands of Minnesotans mourn and protest Saturday’s killing of Pretti, an intensive care nurse who appeared to be acting as a legal observer when Border Patrol agents tackled him to the ground, pinned him and shot him multiple times.His was the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by immigration officers in Minneapolis this year.

Noem, who oversees HSI and CBP, labeled Pretti “a domestic terrorist,” the same term she applied to Good.“The administration is reviewing everything with respect to the shooting, and we will let that investigation play out,” Leavitt said. Bovino said on CNN Sunday that the agents involved in the shooting of Pretti, are still on duty and while they will be taken off the streets of Minneapolis, they will still be allowed to conduct immigration enforcement.The top Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said in a statement Monday that those officers still being on duty is contrary to CBP’s use-of-force policy, which requires three days of paid leave after an agent uses deadly force either on duty or off.“It defies commonsense – and is completely inexcusable – that the agent who killed Alex Pretti Saturday is already back in the field terrorizing our communities and believing – as Greg Bovino has so wrongly asserted – that he is the victim,” he said. “At a minimum, the agent should be on Administrative Leave.”Congressional responseSaturday’s killing could have far-reaching consequences on Capitol Hill.Several congressional Democrats over the weekend coalesced to oppose any funding for the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement, increasing the chances of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week. The shooting also appeared to prompt a handful of congressional Republicans to adjust their position on Trump’s year-long immigration crackdown. The chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland and Governmental Affairs, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, called Monday for the heads of ICE, CBP and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to testify for a hearing by Feb. 12.House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican, also called on the same officials to testify in front of his committee. Sen. John Curtis of Utah was the latest of a handful of Senate Republicans calling for a thorough investigation into the killing and for “those responsible—no matter their title—” to be held accountable.“I disagree with Secretary Noem’s premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,” he wrote on social media. “I will be working with a bipartisan group of senators to demand real oversight and transparency, including supporting calls from @RandPaul for leaders of these operations to testify, so trust can be restored and justice served.”White House’s terms for MinnesotaFor nearly two months, 3,000 federal immigration officers have descended on Minneapolis, dwarfing the city’s police force of roughly 600. The Trump administration deployed the officers for immigration enforcement after right-wing media influencers resurfaced instances of fraud in Minnesota’s social service programs. Leavitt said Monday the Trump administration would only end immigration operations if state and local leaders instructed police to cooperate closely with federal immigration officers.Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, and states and localities are not required to assist.Some localities and states have agreements that local police will notify federal immigration officers if a person they arrest is an immigrant without legal authorization. But some jurisdictions don’t participate because the practice can divert resources or can open law enforcement up to lawsuits for unlawfully detaining an individual for an immigration violation, unless there is a judicial warrant. Attorneys representing the state of Minnesota and city of Minneapolis argued to Judge Kate M. Menendez on Monday that the Trump administration was trying to bend the state to the federal government’s will, a violation of the Constitution’s 10th amendment. The suit, in the U.S. District Court in Minnesota, is attempting to block the ICE surge in the state. Trump, in his Monday social media post, blamed the massive protests in Minnesota on “Welfare Fraud that has taken place in Minnesota, and is at least partially responsible for the violent organized protests going on in the streets.”",,,,2026-01-26 17:57:36.200737

(Mark Olalde/ProPublica)The state of New Mexico is accusing three Texas oil executives of orchestrating “a fraudulent scheme” to pocket revenue from hundreds of oil and gas wells in New Mexico and offload the cost of plugging and cleaning up the wells onto the state’s taxpayers. The suit, filed in late December by the New Mexico attorney general’s office, is the latest salvo in the state’s fight against oil and gas executives accused of foisting old wells onto the public.
The 72-page complaint alleges a yearslong pattern of fraud and self-dealing in which the oil executives — Everett Willard Gray II, Robert Stitzel and Marquis Reed Gilmore Jr., all of Midland, Texas — repeatedly transferred wells among “a series of shell corporations, LLCs, and partnerships they created.” On multiple occasions, the men placed companies into bankruptcy protection, only to move their profitable wells to other companies they owned or managed outside the bankruptcy proceedings, the suit said.
New Mexico faces millions of dollars in costs to plug wells the companies shed through the bankruptcies. Unplugged oil and gas wells can emit climate-warming methane and carcinogenic gases and often leak briny, radioactive wastewater, as ProPublica and Capital & Main detailed in a 2024 investigation. The newsrooms uncovered Gray, Stitzel and Gilmore’s early business dealings and use of bankruptcy proceedings.

This story was originally published by ProPublica and co-published with Capital & Main.

“I will not stand by while bad actors take advantage of the system — avoiding responsibility, burdening the state with costly remediation, and recklessly endangering the health of New Mexicans,” Raúl Torrez, the state’s attorney general, said in a statement.
As part of ProPublica and Capital & Main’s 2024 investigation, the news organizations toured dozens of wells belonging to Remnant, the group of companies through which the men launched their enterprise. Some wells leaked such high volumes of methane that, if ignited, the air could explode; others emitted hydrogen sulfide at potentially lethal concentrations; and several were surrounded by oil and wastewater spills. At the time, the owner of an oil field services company that had worked on Remnant’s wells said that the men filed for bankruptcy protection without paying his company what it was owed.
The recent lawsuit is “meritless” and built on “baseless claims,” Gray said in a statement responding to questions from ProPublica and Capital & Main. “I have always acted ethically and never been involved in any activities to defraud the state of New Mexico. I strongly deny any wrongdoing in this matter,” he said.
New Era Energy & Digital, one of Gray’s companies named in the state’s complaint, ended up with 87 of the group’s best gas wells, and the company said in a press release that those “no longer align with the Company’s business model.” New Era is focused instead on building an AI data center powered by a yet-to-be-built nuclear power station, it said.
Stitzel and Gilmore didn’t respond to requests for comment.
The tactics alleged by the attorney general are commonly used in the industry to squeeze profits from old wells before companies go bankrupt. Oil and gas executives so frequently follow a similar pattern that environmentalists call it “the playbook.”
Oil companies and trade groups argue that most orphan wells are from an earlier era and that modern operators are helping address the problem by paying into various government-managed funds that pay for the plugging of some old wells.
The exact number of orphan wells awaiting cleanup nationwide is unknown, but the figure is believed to be in the hundreds of thousands, if not higher. New Mexico faces as much as a $1.6 billion bill to plug such wells, according to a June 2025 Legislative Finance Committee report.
“As the oil boom is aging and a lot of the wells are becoming low-producing, the risk is increasing,” said Mandy Sackett, the lead New Mexico campaigner for environmental group Earthworks. The potential for taxpayers to be saddled with plugging oil companies’ orphan wells, she said, “poses such a massive financial risk.”
 “Out of the Dark Ages”

The problem of Remnant and other companies leaving wells as orphans is informing a broader reckoning among legislators and regulatory agencies about the inadequacy of New Mexico’s safeguards.
Oil companies are required to set aside funds, called bonds, that the state can call on to pay for well plugging and environmental cleanup. These bonds are meant to protect taxpayers from shouldering such costs in the event that a company goes bankrupt or walks away.
But like all oil-producing states, New Mexico’s bonds cover only a fraction of the true cost of cleanup. A 2024 ProPublica and Capital & Main analysis found that the 15 states that account for nearly all the nation’s oil and gas production held bonds that would cover less than 2% of the projected $151.3 billion cost to plug the wells in their states.
In New Mexico, a fresh attempt at bonding reform kicked off with hearings in October, as the state’s Oil Conservation Commission began updating bonding rules. The proposed amendments, which are backed by a coalition of environmental groups, would require companies to put forward a $150,000 bond for each inactive or low-producing well. Research has shown that these are disproportionately likely to become orphans and the state’s responsibility to plug.
The proposed regulations target companies with large collections of these risky wells and would require companies whose portfolios are made up of at least 15% inactive or low-producing wells to buy bonds for each of their wells. The proposals would also place other layers of regulatory scrutiny on sales of wells to poorly capitalized companies and limit the time that wells could remain idle before needing to be plugged.

Oil Conservation Division officials said in a statement that “the interested parties are currently engaged in settlement talks” for the bonding rulemaking. The agency declined to comment on the attorney general’s lawsuit.
​​New Mexico’s State Land Office, which oversees the state’s publicly owned land, recently initiated a similar process to increase the amount of money set aside in bonds to plug wells within its jurisdiction. The agency estimates that there are 15,000 unplugged oil and gas wells on land it manages.
Ari Biernoff, general counsel of the State Land Office, said that these reforms would bring bonding requirements “out of the Dark Ages” and closer to what the agency would need to fund cleanup should companies walk away.
“Any reasonable observer would conclude we have grossly inadequate bonding,” Biernoff said.
Industry groups have expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed rules.
The New Mexico Oil & Gas Association and Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico submitted counterproposals with significantly reduced bonding increases. The latter said in comments submitted to the state that its suggestion “will keep smaller operators from going out of business.”
“We do not believe it’s in New Mexico’s best interest for the State Land Office to kill a lot of smaller, state-based, good operators to leave only a handful of supermajors,” Jim Winchester, executive director of the Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico, wrote to the agency.
 Remnants of the Oil Industry

Beginning in 2015, Gray, Stitzel and Gilmore aggregated several hundred wells in southeastern New Mexico under the Remnant companies, subsequently racking up regulatory violations, including having too many inactive, unplugged wells. The state’s Oil Conservation Division gave Remnant a deadline of July 2019 to plug some of its wells. Fifteen days before the deadline, the men placed the company into bankruptcy protection.
Remnant’s dissolution kicked off a complex and disputed series of transactions among the three men. According to the attorney general’s complaint, Stitzel and Gilmore created several companies under the name Acacia and purchased most of Remnant’s wells from themselves. Gray, meanwhile, created Solis Partners — a wholly owned subsidiary of Gray’s New Era — and ended up with 87 of the group’s most lucrative gas-producing wells. The bill of sale that landed the wells with Gray’s company was for $10, and Gray signed on behalf of Remnant a change-of-operator application that sent wells to Solis Partners.
Then, in December 2024, a major oil company that the state had asked to plug some of Acacia’s wells sued Acacia to force it to clean up its own mess. Two weeks later, Acacia filed to liquidate through bankruptcy.
Of Remnant’s and Acacia’s wells, 172 ended up as the responsibility of the State Land Office, according to the agency. Eleven of those have been plugged, all but one by other oil companies that hold leases with the agency and stepped up to do the work. Based on the state’s estimated per-well cleanup cost, the remaining wells could cost a total of more than $25 million to plug.
The agency was able to claim a single bond from Remnant worth $20,000.
“This is a very vivid demonstration of why we need an upgrade to the bonding rule,” said Biernoff, the State Land Office general counsel.
The most lucrative wells from Gray, Stitzel and Gilmore’s foray into New Mexico’s oil and gas industry belong to Solis Partners. But even that company appears at risk of leaving them as orphans, as it has about 120 inactive wells on state trust land, according to the State Land Office. Its parent company, New Era, which is pitching plans for a 3,500-acre AI data center campus in southeastern New Mexico, said it is selling the wells.
“Having enriched themselves with the profits from Solis Partners’ and Acacia’s oil and gas production, the Individual Defendants are once again seeking to walk away from the plugging and remediation costs,” the attorney general’s complaint alleged.
Charlie Barrett is an ecologist with environmental group Oilfield Witness who has chronicled pollution at Remnant’s and Acacia’s wells for years. “They’re old, they’re just falling apart,” he said. They are also, he said, emblematic of the small oil and gas operators that represent the final stage of the industry leaving its wells as orphans.
“I wish I could say that it’s unique,” Barrett said, “but it isn’t.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MO-PP-IMG_6626-copy_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 09:57:06.399873
,DC,2026-01-26 14:40:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate Dems probe effect of Trump administration child care cutbacks on rural families,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-probe-effect-trump-administration-child-care-cutbacks-rural-families,,"WASHINGTON — Several U.S. Senate Democrats launched an investigation into how the Trump administration’s child care funding cuts and policy changes are affecting rural families, in a Sunday letter provided exclusively to States Newsroom.Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts led five of her colleagues in urging the respective heads of Rural Development at the Department of Agriculture and the Administration for Children and Families at the Department of Health and Human Services to offer up more information on their “current capacity to support child care, particularly in rural communities.” Joining Warren are Sens. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, Alex Padilla of California and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. “Despite child care being one of the biggest costs American families face, the Trump administration has taken a wrecking ball to the federal programs that aim to make child care more accessible and affordable, including ACF and USDA’s Rural Development Office,” the senators wrote to acting Under Secretary for Rural Development Todd Lindsey and ACF’s Assistant Secretary Alex Adams. USDA Rural Development and ACF work to expand access to child care in rural areas. The senators pointed to a September poll from First Five Years Fund, a federal advocacy group, which found that 4 out of 5 rural Americans “say the ability of working parents to find and afford quality child care is either in a ‘state of crisis’ or ‘a major problem.’” The group said the administration’s slashing of staff at agencies and programs that support affordable child care, including ACF and Rural Development at USDA, are raising concerns that the administration is “failing families across the country and adding to the affordability crisis facing working-class families.” Cuts from federal child care fund to Dem statesThe senators raised alarm over some of the administration’s most sweeping actions regarding child care programs, including attempts to cut off nearly $2.4 billion from the multibillion-dollar Child Care and Development Fund, or CCDF, to California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York earlier in January. All are led by Democratic governors and the administration cited concerns about allegations of fraud.CCDF — administered within the Office of Child Care under ACF — provides federal funding to states, territories and tribes to help low-income families obtain child care.The five Democratic-led states sued in a New York federal court over the freeze, which also included $7.35 billion from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and $869 million from the Social Services Block Grant — totaling more than $10 billion when combined with CCDF. A judge temporarily blocked the administration from freezing the funds earlier this month. A separate judge extended that order Friday. “States are challenging the legality of this freeze, but the consequences would be devastating should the courts permit the administration to permanently withhold the funds,” the senators wrote. Days prior to the announced freeze, the administration said states had to provide “justification” that federal child care funds they receive are spent on “legitimate” providers to get those dollars.That demand followed allegations of fraud in Minnesota child care programs, which had prompted HHS to freeze all child care payments to the state.The administration also announced earlier in January it would be rescinding multiple Biden administration child care rules that “required states to pay providers before verifying any attendance and before care was delivered.” Head Start in rural AmericaThe Democrats argued that President Donald Trump has also “attacked Head Start at every turn since his inauguration.” ACF administers Head Start, which provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families. The senators noted that “Head Start is especially crucial in rural communities, where it is often the only licensed child care program available.” During the record-long government shutdown in 2025, scores of Head Start centers experienced lapses in funding grants as a result.  Even prior to the shutdown, Head Start already experienced chaos during the Trump administration, such as reports of delays in accessing approved grant funding, regional office closures and firings at ACF’s Office of Head Start.Flood of workers departing USDA Meanwhile, USDA saw more than 20,000 employees leave in the first half of 2025, according to a report from the agency’s Office of Inspector General. More than one-third of the agency’s Rural Development unit left during that time.  “Instead of strengthening the programs that aim to address the rural child care crisis, President Trump is firing the people who administer them,” the senators wrote. On top of that, the agency in March confirmed it would be slashing around $1 billion in previously announced funding for programs to help child care facilities, schools and food banks purchase from local farmers. USDA also faced backlash during the shutdown for refusing to tap into a multibillion-dollar contingency fund in order to keep benefits flowing for the country’s main food assistance program known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.The senators urged Lindsey and Adams to respond to their inquiries by Feb. 16. USDA and ACF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",,,,2026-01-26 09:57:06.399873

(U.S. Army Photo by Master Sgt. Justin P. Morelli) A Democratic state lawmaker from Anchorage loudly denounced the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s surge in Minnesota while speaking on the Alaska House floor on Friday.
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, is a military veteran and co-chair of the Legislature’s Joint Armed Services Committee. 
“The facts are that our government is out of control. Norms have been broken at an alarming rate, and the world is watching us in shock,” he said.
Gray’s remarks were met by loud desk-thumping — a form of applause — and came on a day when thousands of Minnesotans marched in subzero weather and held a general strike to show their opposition to ICE efforts in their state.
Tensions are particularly high after several shootings by federal officers, including one in which an officer killed a mother of three.
The remarks came one day before federal agents fatally shot another Minneapolis resident on Saturday, prompting nationwide protests throughout the weekend. 
On Friday, Gray questioned Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s decision to provide National Guard administrative support for ICE in Alaska and President Donald Trump’s threatened use of regular U.S. Army troops in Minnesota. 
Up to 1,500 active-duty troops of the U.S. Army’s 11th Airborne Division, based in Anchorage, have been ordered to stand by for possible deployment to Minneapolis — Minnesota’s largest city — according to National Public Radio. 
Gray and Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks and the other co-chair of the Joint Armed Services Committee, have sent letters to Alaska’s congressional delegation and Brig. Gen. John P. Cogbill, commander of the 11th Airborne.
In those letters, Gray and Kawasaki say they are receiving “enquiries … from the Alaskan people” and pose a series of questions.
How long will the 11th Airborne be in Minnesota? How does a deployment fit in the division’s mission to defend the United States against foreign threats? Could soldiers be detaining suspected undocumented people? Would the 11th Airborne fight the Minnesota National Guard if Gov. Tim Walz activates it to defend protesters?
“Fifteen hundred active-duty soldiers may be sent from Alaska to Minnesota to protect ICE agents as they continue their efforts to arrest and detain suspected undocumented immigrants,” Gray said, “But who really needs the protection? Is it the ICE agents, or is it the folks who are terrified to leave their homes, to go to work, to pick their kids up from school or to actually show up at their immigration appointments?”
While Gray’s comments appeared to have the support of many legislators in the chamber — judging by the desk-pounding applause — there was at least one dissenting voice.
Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, is a veteran, the spouse of a veteran, and a Latina, she said, explaining that she had also sent a letter to Gen. Cogbill, but her letter was to remind him that he is not legally obligated to answer the Legislature’s questions or testify in the Capitol.
Allard said she has been deployed overseas with the military and with the U.S. State Department.
“I experienced things when I worked for the US State Department, of women being abused, hit — watched them get their teeth knocked in, where I had to stand by and couldn’t do anything,” she said.
“We have a lot going on in our country, dividing, saying we’re this or we’re that. We’re all Americans, but it doesn’t mean that it’s okay to have riots across our country. If the military and the federal government and the Department of War and the 11th Airborne Division decide that it’s best to go to Minnesota, that’s what we need to do,” she said.
Allard’s comments were met by quieter but noticeable desk-pounding, with the loudest coming from Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake.
He said afterward that he thinks Gray incorrectly described some aspects of ICE’s work in Minnesota. For example, Gray said ICE detained a five-year-old in Minnesota.
“There’s a little bit more to the story, McCabe said.
“We shouldn’t be messing around in another branch of the government in their bailiwick,” he said. “The worst people in Alaska to manage the National Guard is probably the state Legislature.”

A pilot partnership between St. Johnsbury School District and Northeast Kingdom Human Services demonstrates how school and mental health collaboration improves student outcomes, keeps children in their communities, and reduces education costs through Vermont’s Success Beyond 6 framework.

As Vermont grapples with education reform and rising property taxes, one partnership, among many in the Vermont Care Partners (VCP) network, is proving that innovation through collaboration can address both student mental health needs and affordability concerns in the Northeast Kingdom. This year, St. Johnsbury School District and Northeast Kingdom Human Services (NKHS), a Designated Agency (DA), started a pilot program – Catamount Community Connections (C3P) – a new program that demonstrates how effective school-DA partnerships can keep students in their community, improve outcomes, and generate cost savings for taxpayers.
The creation of C3P was intentional, achieved through partnership, and centered on the local community. After 18 months of collaborative development, the result is a program that embodies the kind of integrated partnership Success Beyond 6 was designed to create, where schools and mental health agencies combine their unique strengths to create something neither could accomplish alone.
In the C3P model, NKHS brings ownership and renovation of the facility, along with specialized mental health services rooted in trauma-informed, evidence-based approaches. Their Board-Certified Behavioral Analysts (BCBAs) and clinicians provide supervision and quality oversight that schools simply cannot replicate on their own. Additionally, NKHS enables the leveraging of federal Medicaid funding through Success Beyond 6, reducing costs and the local tax burden. St. Johnsbury School District contributes its special education expertise, individualized education programs, educational curriculum and instruction, and the vital connection to students’ home schools and community. Together, what’s created is an environment where students can access their education in the least restrictive setting, stay connected to their families and community, and ultimately work toward returning to their local public school – all while costing significantly less than traditional out-of-district placements.
C3P leverages Success Beyond 6, Vermont’s established framework for school-DA partnerships, which isn’t a new or untested concept, but rather an evolution of a proven model. Success Beyond 6 has been operating since December 1992 and was created specifically as a partnership between mental health, education, students, and families. By 2019, 77% of Vermont’s public schools participated in the program, which was designed from the beginning to be driven by local needs and responsive to local conditions.
The partnership model works for several interconnected reasons: Success Beyond 6 uses local education funds as a state match to draw down federal Medicaid dollars, so schools pay only a portion of the cost of each service while the federal government contributes the rest.  Beyond financial mechanics, DAs provide mental health services including behavioral intervention, trauma treatment, and clinical supervision. State oversight through the Department of Mental Health (DMH) ensures adherence to quality standards and the measurement of outcomes throughout.

Vermont faces converging crises in student mental health and school affordability that require innovative, cost-effective solutions. The statistics driving the need for a program like C3P, paint a picture that would benefit from creative intervention.

34% of Vermont high school students report poor mental health – stress, anxiety, and depression – most of the time. 
Vermont ranks first nationally among students with Individualized Education Plans (IEP) for emotional disturbance, and over five percent of Vermont students with IEPs are placed in separate schools, more than double the national average of 2.4%. 
Schools across the state report that they lack the in-house capacity, staffing, and specialized resources to respond effectively to these growing needs.

The special education and budget pressures compound these challenges. 

Students with IEPs have increased from 17.9% to 19.6% between 2019 and 2024, while the four-year graduation rate for students with IEPs has fallen to just 67%, compared to 86% for students without IEPs. 
Property tax increases have reached as high as 18.5% in some districts, driven in part by the extraordinary costs of out-of-district placements and transportation. 

These pressures are particularly acute in the Northeast Kingdom and serve as the catalyst for C3P’s creation.
Locally, the partnership with schools and NKHS has made both a financial and clinical difference. Students served through NKHS’s school-based programs have made significant progress in treatment. 
The Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) is a point-in-time assessment designed to help educators and mental health professionals understand both the challenges and strengths of each student within the SB6 program. It enables a student’s care team to evaluate key areas such as academic performance, attendance, peer and teacher relationships, and school behavior, identifying both needs and strengths. 
An analysis of data from 2023 to the present for active SB6 students shows that 84% of NKHS school-based clients developed skills that reduced needs across one or more CANS domains.
The following data represent students who initially scored a high need and later dropped to a low need on their most recent assessment:

50% of students enhanced skills that increased academic persistence and engagement in learning.
75% of students demonstrated improvement in reducing tardiness and arriving at school/class on time.
75% of students improved skills that contributed to fewer school discipline issues.
53% of students with a high need score demonstrated improved attention skills, enabling them to stay focused more effectively.

In addition to clinical benefits for students, the partnership model can reduce costs for schools. Traditional out-of-district placements can cost up to $120,000 per year in specialized school tuition, with transportation adding up to another $100,000 per year per student. That’s up to $220,000 annually for a single student. Although not every student placement costs this much, out-of-district placements are more expensive than keeping students in their local communities. The C3P partnership model, by contrast, provides in-district alternative programming with integrated mental health support at significantly lower costs. The local placement eliminates long-distance transportation costs entirely, while Success Beyond 6 Medicaid funding provides a federal match, meaning schools pay only a portion of each dollar spent on services, with the federal government contributing the rest. Savings from this program, if expanded, could be significant. 
Currently, the C3P pilot program serves fewer than 10 students, but over the next few years, it is hoped that the capacity will increase to 30. This has the potential to support students in their local community and save an estimated $1 million – $4 million in costs.
It’s important to emphasize that C3P doesn’t replace specialized independent therapeutic schools – Vermont needs those programs, too. Rather, C3P fills a critical middle ground: intensive enough for students with significant needs, local enough to maintain family and community connections, and cost-effective enough to be sustainable over the long term.
The St. Johnsbury School-NKHS partnership through C3P is more than just one program serving a small student group. It’s a proof-of-concept for how Vermont can address its dual challenges of student mental health needs and affordability pressures. It provides:

specialized mental health expertise that schools need but cannot build alone,
creates a pathway back to traditional school settings, 
directly addresses Vermont’s first-in-nation rates of emotional disturbance, 
leverages federal Medicaid match to reduce the local burden,
creates local capacity that can serve multiple districts, 
generates measurable savings that benefit taxpayers directly. 

Innovation happens through partnership rather than isolation and creates opportunity. The C3P model is a program that other regions across Vermont could replicate.
Vermont’s challenges are real. Student mental health needs are high, special education costs are rising, and property taxpayers are strained. Singular programs are not a silver bullet, but as C3P demonstrates, effective partnerships between schools and VCP network agencies offer an opportunity to solve some of the pressing needs facing the Vermont education system. 
St. Johnsbury School District and NKHS have shown what’s possible when partners commit to working together, leverage established frameworks like Success Beyond 6, and innovate to meet local needs. This example points toward solutions that are both educationally sound and fiscally responsible. As Vermont considers education reform, the C3P model offers a critical reminder: some of our best solutions come not from choosing between quality and affordability, but from partnerships that deliver both.

She says the next step is to blend Blueprint for Literacy with the Kansas State Board of Education's literacy program known as Every Child Can Read. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature directed the Kansas State Board of Education and Kansas Board of Regents to implement separate laws enacted during the past four years to elevate reading skills of public school students.
Both the 2022 Every Child Can Read Act in the hands of the K-12 Board of Education and the 2024 Blueprint for Literacy organized by higher education’s Board of Regents recognized the threat of failing a majority of 450,000 students enrolled in Kansas classrooms.
“Reading and literacy, reading and writing, are the fundamental skills in which all other learning is built,” said Cynthia Lane, director of the Blueprint for Literacy. “Literacy is directly related to health outcomes and the ability to secure high quality jobs. I like to say literacy is opportunity. It’s also about justice and freedom, because in order to have true freedom you need to have the skills so that you can make decisions for yourself.”


Evidence for urgency to the state’s work on child literacy wasn’t difficult to find. Testing showed 55% of Kansas students in third through 10th grades read at the limited or basic levels, which meant they couldn’t handle the content independently. Put another way, state exams revealed less than half read at the proficient or advanced levels.
In an interview for Kansas Reflector’s podcast, Lane said she was convinced the Legislature should weave the two literacy programs into a coordinated set of policies aimed at improving reading success in the classroom. She said educators and students would benefit from coalescing around a single vision.
“We have no common plan,” she said. “No common goals. No common accountability. And, frankly, having two laws has created confusion amongst our legislators about who’s doing what and how can we know if we’re making progress. We are advocating for a comprehensive implementation plan that brings both the pre-K-12 system and the higher education system into alignment.”
Lane said she was impressed by the Board of Education’s commitment to K-12 reforms outlined in Every Child Can Read. It required school districts to make students read proficiently by third grade by relying on evidence-based instruction. It mandated universal screening of students, better communication with parents and targeted student interventions, including one-on-one tutoring or summer school classes in reading.
“The state Board of Education and the Department of Education has done really powerful work,” Lane said.
Blueprint for Literacy required discredited reading methodologies to be abandoned by Kansas universities and to be replaced by phonics-based approaches. The law created two undergraduate college courses focused on application of structured literacy by students preparing to become school teachers in Kansas. So far, nearly 2,000 students have gone through those courses at a private or public college in Kansas. Another 1,000 expect to finish by July.
The bipartisan Blueprint for Literacy law also established two graduate courses in reading literacy. All of the state’s 18,000 elementary educators in the field must pass both courses, or a comparable curriculum, to retain a professional license in Kansas. Approximately 9,000 completed the State Board of Education’s LETRS program, which has been offered for several years.
During the past nine months, Blueprint for Literacy paid the cost of tuition for 500 teachers who enrolled in the two foundations of reading graduate-level courses. In addition, Blueprint for Literacy provided each teacher with a professional mentor to help implement reforms in their classrooms.
“The resounding feedback is that the coach has made the difference in transforming what they’re doing in their classes every day,” Lane said.
The state’s goal for Blueprint for Literacy would have 90% of third- through eighth-grade students reading at the basic level and at least 50% of those students at the proficient level by 2033. In Kansas, assessments of reading placed students on a four-level, low-to-high scale of limited, basic, proficient or advanced.
“There is urgency to move because every parent wants the teacher in the classroom to have the top skills,” she said.
Lane, the former superintendent of schools in Kansas City, Kansas, said she understood at a personal level what it meant to be a low-skill reader. She said she didn’t learn to read until the seventh grade, in part because methods at that time tended to require children to memorize words based on pictures or other cues.
“It was devastating to be in an elementary school and not read,” she said.
Lane, who went on to earn a doctorate in education, said research demonstrated the brain worked in such a way that explicit instruction in phonics — sounds that letters make — did a better job of building reading fluency and comprehension among children.
“Based on all the science and the research that’s been done, we know how to teach every child to read,” she said. “But they need instruction that first identifies what kids know and where there gaps are and design the instruction specifically to what every individual child needs.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cynthia-Lane-2-20260122_130806-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-26 09:57:06.399873

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows is arguing that the U.S. Department of Justice’s demand that Minnesota hand over its state voter information as a precondition for ending immigration operations in that state underscores that the federal government is “inflicting violence in order to create chaos and control our states and elections.”
In a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote the state could end the federal law enforcement surge if it repealed pro-immigrant “sanctuary” policies, and turned over Medicaid and food assistance records as well as voter data to the federal government.
“I am confident that these simple steps will help bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans,” Bondi wrote in the letter, sent after a federal agent shot and killed Alex Jeffrey Pretti Saturday.
Pretti’s killing, captured from multiple angles by witnesses recording on their cell phones, was the second shooting death of a U.S. citizen by immigration agents in Minneapolis during the weeks-long federal operation there. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched an immigration operation in Maine last week, detaining several lawful residents.
Bellows, a Democrat running for governor, has twice rejected requests to provide the DOJ with sensitive voter data, including driver’s license numbers, partial social security numbers and full dates of birth, along with names of officials who handle the list’s maintenance, the number of ineligible voters the state identified due to noncitizenship and voter registration applications from  specific time periods, among other information.  
The DOJ has argued the data is necessary to assess states’ compliance with the statewide voter registration list maintenance provisions of the National Voter Registration Act. 
Maine is now among the states being sued by the federal government over its failure to comply.
In a motion to dismiss filed last month, the state argued that the lawsuit should be discharged because the DOJ failed to support a valid legal case as to why it is justified to such information, and that its data requests violate federal privacy law. 
The motion also noted voter registration databases contain information about people’s choice of political party and in which elections they chose to vote, which are activities protected by the First Amendment. Bellows and other secretaries of state have also raised concern about the federal government using voter records for citizenship probes. 
In a statement Sunday, Bellows said, “Maine will never turn over our voter rolls as a ransom payment to get ICE to end its unconstitutional assault on our state. 
“Our founders designed a system where states and local governments, not the federal government, oversee elections to safeguard us from exactly this — a tyrannical, power-hungry president trampling on our constitutional rights,” she wrote. 
Bellows said as the state’s top election official, she will stand with Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, who described the letter as “an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday called for U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to resign and Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino to be fired a day after federal immigration enforcement officers shot at another U.S. citizen in Minneapolis multiple times, killing him.
Weeks after the death of Renee Good, Border Patrol agents killed Alex Pretti on Friday, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse who worked for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. During an altercation in which Pretti was observing and documenting federal agents beforehand, multiple officers tackled Pretti to the ground. Pretti reportedly had a gun, for which he had a lawful permit to carry. After one agent took away the gun while Pretti was pinned on the ground, officers appear to have fired at him at least 10 times.
Immediately after the shooting, members of the Trump administration called Pretti a domestic terrorist. First Assistant U.S. Attorney and former California Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli defended the agents, arguing that there “is a high likelihood” law enforcement officers “will be legally justified in shooting you” if you approach them with a gun — an assertion that the National Rifle Association called “dangerous and wrong.”
On Sunday President Donald Trump also blamed Democrats and sanctuary laws, such as those in California, for the two deaths in Minneapolis.
In response, Newsom called for Border Patrol officers to return to the border, ending the militarization of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and investigations into “every single federal agent who is breaking the law.” His office also posted a know-your-rights guide for dealing with local police and immigration enforcement officers.
But the governor’s statements are part of a political calculus that is playing out as he makes a likely bid for the presidency. After Good’s death, Newsom’s team responded that ICE is “state sponsored terrorism.” Newsom eventually walked back this description during an interview with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.
Meanwhile, as Congress weighs a spending deal that would include billions of dollars more for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Assemblymember Isaac Bryan of Culver City called for a general strike to oppose ICE, similar to the large-scale walkout organized in Minneapolis.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta also filed a brief supporting Minnesota’s lawsuit opposing the federal government’s immigration campaign in the state. Along with 19 other attorneys general, the brief argued that the “government’s unlawful conduct … infringes upon (Minnesota’s) constitutionally-guaranteed state sovereignty,” and that without legal intervention the government “will no doubt threaten other States and local communities across the nation.”

Fewer homicides in CA for second year in a row

Homicide rates in California have dropped for the second year in a row, consistent with a nationwide trend after a crime surge during the pandemic, reports CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.
In the city of Los Angeles, homicides dropped by more than 18% to 230 in 2025, and San Francisco had its lowest rates since 1954. Besides major cities, homicides have also been down in cities including Oakland, Fresno, Richmond and Lodi, though Kern County’s remains the state’s highest.
The declines mark a milestone after California experienced a rise in homicides during the pandemic, though crime in 2020-21 nationally and in California was still notably lower than the highs seen in the early 1990s.
Many factors could be at play for the falling numbers, crime researchers say. Magnus Lofstrom, policy director of criminal justice at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, said the pandemic-era homicide spike may have been the result of various social disruptions such as school shutdowns, unemployment and the pausing of public services.

Feds withdraw demand for patient records for now

The U.S. Department of Justice has agreed to drop its demand for medical records of more than 3,000 young transgender patients at the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, writes CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.
In July 2025 the Justice Department said it sent subpoenas to more than 20 medical providers that offered gender-affirming care for minors. Hospitals were directed to provide a wide array of documents, including ones “sufficient to identify each patient … who was prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy,” court documents show.
The department said it was probing doctors and clinics for potential “healthcare fraud” and “false statements.” But the department never provided evidence of fraud, said the director of one of the law firms representing families who sued the department in a class action lawsuit to stop the subpoenas. 
Under the agreement the Justice Department will rescind its requests through 2029 for documents that identify patients or their families.

L.A.’s city council is expected to vote on a motion Tuesday that would tweak the city’s 2022 policy of taxing high-value real estate sales. In an attempt to encourage more construction, the motion calls for some development projects, such as apartments and condos, to be exempted from the tax. An anti-tax group wants to put a similar statewide measure before voters. Read more from CalMatters’ Ben Christopher.

Kathy Brown-Lowe 
Kathy Brown-Lowe is a crime and trauma survivor who lives in Los Angeles


Ten years ago, I hit bottom.
For more than 50 years I had been trying to work my way through traumas that had accumulated throughout my life. As a child, I, along with one of my sisters, was abused by my step-father. When I was a young woman, my mother and my biological father died, and a number of other close family members, including several sisters and brothers, also died prematurely. I’ve been a victim of extreme episodes of domestic violence. 
My pain caused me to fall into despair, ultimately using an array of drugs and, in middle-age, falling into homelessness. I became estranged from my family. I ended up staying at the Midnight Mission, in downtown Los Angeles. I cried every day.
While I was at the mission, friends told me to check out the Downtown Women’s Center, which has helped provide housing for thousands of women experiencing homelessness for nearly half a century. They offer dignity to people who too often have been deprived of any sense of their own worth. 
I started visiting the center nearly every day, talking with their case workers, eating in their cafeteria, receiving medical assistance and — eventually — getting linked with mental health therapists and counselors at the on-site Trauma Recovery Center, which provides services and support to victims of crime.
That’s crucial because nearly 3 out of 4 people experiencing homelessness in California have endured physical violence, and more than 9 in 10 are crime or trauma survivors. 
The Trauma Recovery Center provided me with a community of caregivers willing to go the extra mile on my behalf. I always said I needed a village to help me get whole, and the center staff were willing to be that village.
At the center I finally began to grapple with the pain that has haunted me since I was a child. It was in that safe space — where people didn’t judge me and didn’t make me feel small — that I was able to start talking about my fears and anxieties. I found that as I talked more about the traumas that were so deeply embedded in my life story, and that I had bottled up inside of me for so long, I began relying less on the drugs that I’d been using as a form of self-medication.
It didn’t happen all in a rush, but over time my life began to make more sense. 
There are 24 Trauma Recover Centers in other communities across California. They are places where dedicated, trained staff work tirelessly to help survivors of crime heal from the psychological traumas and damage that have accumulated over many decades and that impact their ability to function fully and happily on a daily basis. 
As anyone who’s been through the trauma I have knows, you usually don’t make good decisions if you don’t feel safe.
Sadly, after the passage of Proposition 36 last year, the funding stream for programs such as the Trauma Recovery Centers at the Downtown Women’s Center is at risk. I can’t imagine anything more shortsighted than not making sure these centers have the resources they need to get victims immediate access to the help and support they need and deserve.
I understand the frustration of voters and politicians who want quick fixes to social problems and who are angered by continual waves of crime, drug addiction and homelessness. It’s tempting to reach for punishment over treatment and crime prevention when you are angry and disappointed at the actions of other people. 
But in a zero-sum world, where more money spent on incarceration means less money available for California’s growing network of Trauma Recovery Centers, that’s a bad bargain. 
The Trauma Recovery Center has given me a second chance at life and the ability to give back to the community of which I am a part. 
Today I’m 68, living in my own apartment again. I have strong relationships with my children, four grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and many of their friends — all of whom consider me to be their honorary great-grandmother and call me their “G.G.” I couldn’t have done any of that without the work of the people at the Trauma Recovery Center.
I hope California’s legislators and governor understand the importance of these centers to thousands of men and women like me around the state, and that they continue to allocate dollars to allow their vital work to go on.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/100824_Inside-Safe_CS_CM_41.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555
,California,2026-01-26 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,California cities just saw their lowest homicide rates in decades. It’s not clear why,Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2026/01/california-homicide-rate/,"Homicides in California surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, killings are down to historic lows in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and many other cities.","In summary
Homicides in California surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, killings are down to historic lows in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and many other cities.


For the second year in a row, Gov. Gavin Newsom is celebrating California’s declining homicide rate while using it as a cudgel against his political foes. 
“Your state’s homicide rate is 117% higher than California’s,” he told a Missouri congressman who needled Newsom on social media last summer. 
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders caught his attention, too. “Your homicide rate is literally DOUBLE California’s,” he wrote on social media addressing her. 
What’s been clear for the last three years is that homicides are down in Los Angeles and San Francisco — but also in Fresno, Oakland, Richmond and Lodi. 
“California cities are seeing record-low homicide rates,” Newsom said in his state of the state speech earlier this month. “Oakland, the lowest since 1967; LA, the lowest since 1966; and San Francisco, the lowest since 1954.”
After a spike during the early days of the pandemic, homicides are in fact down nationwide. 
The reason why is far less clear. To put it in the language of crime researchers, the answer is “multifactorial.” 
Magnus Lofstrom, policy director of criminal justice at nonpartisan think tank the Public Policy Institute of California, said the spike of homicides during the pandemic may have been the result of disruptions in government activities: Schools were shut down, people were out of work, community-based programs for violence prevention and many basic public services were put on pause, Lofstrom said. 
The 2020 numbers were a shock. After years of decline, the homicide rate in California surged by 31% in 2020 to 5.5 homicides per 100,000 people. In 2021, it rose again, to about 6 per 100,000 people. 
But that trend began to turn in 2022, when the number of homicides dropped by 7%, then in 2023 by 14% and in 2024 by another 12%. By the end of 2024, the homicide rate in California was down to 4.3 per 100,000 people. 
California’s population was about 20 million people the last time the state recorded such low homicide numbers, half of what it is today. 
At the same time the homicide numbers were climbing, the percentage of cases cleared by police was falling. A police department’s “clearance rate” compares the number of crimes reported to the number of arrests made. 
Lofstrom said that the homicide clearance rate statewide was 64.7% in 2019, and that it had dropped to 54.6% in 2021 – though the rates can vary dramatically among police departments.  
“What we see now in the data up to 2024 is that we’re back up over 64% for homicide clearances,” Lofstrom said. 
Half as many homicides in Oakland
Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said homicides are down along with major gun crimes including robberies and assaults with firearms. Oakland’s 67 homicides in 2025 were its lowest since 1967. It had 134 homicides in 2021.
In Los Angeles, homicides dropped by more than 18% to 230 in 2025, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of LAPD data. 
The numbers documenting the recent decline in homicide rates, and the earlier spike, come with a major asterisk: The way crime data is collected is inconsistent. Law enforcement agencies self-report to the FBI, which each year publishes data under the Uniform Crime Reporting Program. The California Department of Justice then produces statewide reports from those numbers. 
But not every department reports its statistics. And among those that do, some don’t report all their data — or report the information differently. For example, some jurisdictions only report crimes that lead to incarceration. 
Homicide numbers in California are provided by the state Justice Department near the end of the fiscal year in June, so the most recent statistics are from 2024. The Justice Department declined to provide CalMatters with updated numbers through 2025. 
The drop in homicide rates wasn’t as pronounced in Orange and Orange and Ventura counties, which never experienced a significant pandemic spike, and Kern County, where the homicide rate maintains a stubborn hold as the state’s highest. 
Nationwide drop in crime
A long-range look at crime statistics, particularly homicide data, shows that the 2020-21 crime rate nationally and in California was still a fraction of its highs in the early 1990s. Simply counting the year-over-year changes belies a larger truth: Crime throughout the 2020s has been down significantly compared to the rate 20 or 30 years ago. 
As with the long-term homicide rate declines, the recent tapering in California is part of a nationwide trend. A report published Thursday by the Council on Criminal Justice, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C., think tank found that among 35 major cities nationwide, homicides dropped by 21% between 2024 and 2025. 
When the FBI publishes its crime statistics later this year, Council on Criminal Justice researchers said in the report that the national homicide rate could drop to 4 per 100,000 people, which would be the lowest homicide rate ever on record. 
Shani Buggs, an associate professor at UC Davis and public health researcher, said in the report that cities with major decreases in their homicide rate tended to spend federal pandemic funds on violence prevention and have police departments that focused on people with repeated allegations of violent crimes, helping them quickly resume pre-pandemic clearance rates.
“We do not have reliable, multi-sector data or comparable contextual information available across jurisdictions to definitively identify — now or perhaps ever — what drove these declines,” Buggs said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/010318-Oakland-PD-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)After years of waiting, several immigrants in Utah were just days or moments away from making their case for asylum in the United States. 
But before judges considered their arguments earlier this month, their cases were dealt a major blow, their attorneys said.  
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security filed motions to “pretermit” their cases, or dismiss them before the long-anticipated hearing and deport them to a “safe third country” where they don’t have ties to seek asylum there instead. 
“It’s a complete nightmare,” said South Jordan immigration attorney Carlos Trujillo.

Trujillo noted that in October, an immigration appeals board effectively ruled the burden is on immigrants to prove they are likely to be persecuted or tortured in the third country and therefore should be allowed to stay in the U.S. 
“There is no way to save the case, because there is no way to demonstrate that you will be persecuted in a country that you have never been in,” Trujillo said. 
But he will try anyway at upcoming hearings where he said he will have 15 minutes to make such a case on behalf of clients originally from Venezuela. 
It comes as the Trump administration carries out mass deportations and seeks to clear a backlog of asylum cases. More than 2 million immigrants are awaiting asylum hearings, according to Syracuse University’s TRAC database. 
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to email requests for comment from Utah News Dispatch. It has previously said it is “using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system.” It has also referred to “lawful bilateral arrangements” allowing unauthorized immigrants to seek legal protection in other nations that have agreed to adjudicate their claims.

The United States has a longstanding third-country agreement with Canada but signed more recent agreements with countries including Ecuador, Guatemala and Honduras.  
“They’re saying, ‘Hey, because we have the agreements with these countries, they’re not even eligible to apply for asylum here. Let’s ship them to Honduras or Ecuador and see if they’ll grant them asylum instead,’” said Utah immigration attorney Nicholle Pitt White.  
The government’s practice of filing “pretermission motions” intensified nationally in November after the appeals decision, with thousands filed. Use of the legal strategy seems to have started growing in Utah in recent weeks, according to Trujillo and Pitt White. 
The attorneys can count the number of cases in their offices on one or two hands, but suspect more are being filed. 
What we know about how ICE arrests have increased in Utah under Trump

“It’s very possible they’ve done it in other cases where people don’t have attorneys, and we just wouldn’t hear those stories,” Pitt White said. 
In and outside of Utah, lawyers are trying to get creative in how they fight against the maneuver. One argument, Pitt White said: The United States’ third-country agreement with Ecuador isn’t in full force because specific criteria for who will and will not be accepted under the accord hasn’t been set.  
Pitt White noted Ecuador has one of the highest homicide rates in South America and Honduras has in recent years had the highest rate of people fleeing and seeking asylum in the U.S. 
She believes one of her clients who’s currently being held in a detention center had a strong case before the change in the government’s strategy. 
“But because of the timing when this policy came out, the motion being filed, we got stuck in a bad spot for our client,” Pitt White said. “It feels kind of hopeless.”

And if they don't have savings, then they don't have a center.” (Courtesy Camille Bennett)When Talia Shelby heard on the radio the federal government was freezing a program that helps pay for her 3-year-old daughter’s child care, she had to turn the volume down.
“I’m scared to even think about it,” Shelby said. “That’s another anxiety for me to have. It’s hard when you’re a single parent and you’re just trying to figure it out, and then the government fights with each other.”
In a Dec. 30 X post, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced a freeze in funding that assists low-income families with child care costs and promised rules changes that could reduce payments to child-care providers in a Jan. 5 press release.
The catalyst for the announcements was an unverified, viral video by a right-wing influencer that purports to show day-care centers in Minnesota that are receiving federal funds but aren’t serving children.
Details about the federal government’s plans and how they will affect states across the nation remain uncertain. State agencies administer the federal child-care funds, and administrators in some states, including Alabama, say the federal government hasn’t notified them of any changes. A spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Human Resources said Friday the agency received a payment from the federal government on Jan. 21.
“Alabama DHR has not received any official guidance/correspondence from the Office of Child Care regarding this matter,” a  Jan. 7 statement from Alabama DHR reads. “Also, we have not received any notification of funds being frozen.”
Mississippi Today and a Georgia House of Representatives member reported similar responses from administrators in those states.
But based on the sparse information the U.S. Health and Human Services Department has shared publicly, child-welfare advocates and policy analysts in Alabama said the consequences of threatened actions could be devastating for child-care businesses and the families they serve. Employers and the state’s economy also could suffer if parents drop out of the workforce, they said.
Shelby, who lives in Florence, Alabama, and has worked at an area hotel for nine years, said if her child-care subsidy payments were interrupted or the center her daughter attends closed due to changes in how providers are paid, she likely wouldn’t be able to keep her job. Shelby’s daughter has autism and is non-verbal. The daycare where she’s enrolled full time is the only one Shelby could find that participates in the subsidy program and employs teachers trained to work with children who have autism.
“That’s hard, taking away the ability for us to pay them,” she said.
Sa-Vaughnie Johnson, senior program director of early care and education services with the Family Guidance Center of Alabama, which helps families secure child care assistance, said potential funding changes would deal a significant blow to all child-care providers in Alabama that participate in the subsidy program – and a vast majority do. Those in rural and high-poverty areas are especially vulnerable, she said.
“I don’t know if they could sustain themselves if that happened,” Johnson said. “We know that centers that take subsidy really need that subsidy to survive. They have to pay their workers, they have to feed these kids.”
The Family Guidance Center is one of a handful of nonprofit child-care management agencies that partner with the Alabama Department of Human Resources to administer the federally funded subsidized child-care program. Qualifying families receive assistance on a sliding scale based on income, Johnson said. Parents have to be working or in school full time, and they pay a portion of child-care costs. Alabama DHR covers the rest by making subsidy payments directly to providers using federal funds.
The average annual cost in Alabama for a toddler in center-based care was $8,424 in 2024, according to Child Care Aware of America.

Attempts to freeze funds met with lawsuits

The X post by HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill states: “Starting today, all ACF payments across America will require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state.”
“ACF” is the Administration for Children and Families, a division of HHS that oversees the Child Care and Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the Social Services Block Grant – all federal funding sources for states to assist families with children. The Child Care and Development Fund subsidizes child care for 1.4 million children nationwide and 40,226 in Alabama, according to the HHS website and Alabama DHR, respectively.
HHS announced Jan. 6 it had sent letters to the governors of five states led by Democrats – California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York – notifying them that access to all three funding streams was restricted pending further review. The decision followed “serious concerns about widespread fraud and misuse of taxpayer dollars in state-administered programs,” according to a press release.
The federal government asked those states to provide data including the names and Social Security numbers of those who received benefits from some programs going back to 2022.
The five states filed a lawsuit challenging the freeze, and a federal judge ruled on Jan. 9 funding must continue for at least two weeks while arguments play out in court.
In a Jan. 13 statement to the Alabama Reflector, HHS said the department is asking for records of attendance, inspections, complaints and internal state discrepancies for centers suspected of fraud in Minnesota.
“For those centers NOT suspected of fraud in Minnesota or in other states, there is still additional verification, but not as extensive,” the statement reads. “Other child care centers will be expected to provide administrative data.”
The federal government typically distributes CCDF funds to states in quarterly installments, although the grants are awarded annually, according to the First Five Years Fund, a nonprofit that works to build federal-level bipartisan support for quality child care and early learning programs.
Any delay in payments would be a stressor for many child-care providers in Alabama, said Camille Bennett, an advocate and co-owner of two child-care centers.
“Most child-care centers depend on the child-care subsidies, if they’re taking in a lot of subsidies, to pay their staff,” she said. “And if it goes away, then they would have to rely on their savings – period. And if they don’t have savings, then they don’t have a center.”
More than 50 state and national organizations issued a joint statement Jan. 13 asking Congress members to ​​ensure federal child-care resources continue to reach eligible families.
“We urge leaders to act with urgency to ensure that the Administration for Children and Families disburses CCDF funding without further disruption, while working in partnership with states as they deliver CCDF funding efficiently and responsibly,” said the statement, submitted during a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education.

Attendance verification and fraud monitoring

DHR said in a statement that it implemented a child-care management system last February which, among other things, tracks attendance and includes several new safeguards to prevent fraud.
“We continue to explore other measures to ensure protocols are in place and followed,” the statement said.
The new system involves QR codes parents scan with their phones when they drop off and pick up their children, said Joycelyn Williams, director of the KinderCare center in Hoover, Alabama.
“We don’t have to do anything with it,” Williams said of the attendance data. “We just print out the code and it goes straight to DHR.”
Johnson said child-care providers receive a new QR code each day as an anti-fraud measure.
“That was just a cleaner, more efficient way of making sure that we are doing with the funds what we should be done with funds,” she said of the QR-code system.
The Family Guidance Center requires families to provide Social Security cards, birth certificates, drivers’ licenses and pay stubs through its application process, Johnson said.
Currently, if a child is absent 10 consecutive days, based on electronic attendance records, they are automatically unenrolled from the subsidy program and parents have to reenroll them to restore payments, according to Alabama DHR.
Carol Gundlach, senior policy analyst with Alabama Arise, said fraud is extremely rare in Alabama’s child-care subsidy program. She said she’s worked with DHR for 30 years in various capacities, including as an advocate, a contractor and through her tenure on the state’s child-care advisory council.
“We certainly know what children are getting funded under the child care block grant because there are contractors with DHR whose job it is to certify families and children as eligible to receive a subsidy,” she said. “So the idea that there are providers out there who just are not submitting plans or documentation or keeping records is simply incorrect.”
By law, state oversight mechanisms include internal controls, state audits and inspector general reviews, fraud detection and investigations and provider monitoring, according to the First Five Years Fund.
States essentially apply for CCDF funds through state plans they submit to the federal government, according to the statement Alabama DHR provided. Those plans include sections in which states must disclose any fraud they’ve uncovered and describe measures they take to prevent fraudulent activity.
According to Alabama’s 299-page 2025-2027 state plan, the most recent analysis found no improper payments that were a direct result of fraud in 2022. Twenty-two parents and two child-care providers were disqualified from the program for intentional program violations during 2023, per the state plan.
Proposed changes to provider pay could cause closures

In the midst of controversy over funding freezes, HHS announced Jan. 5 it was starting a rule-making process to change how providers are paid.
HHS said it was rescinding Biden-era rules that require states to pay child-care providers in advance and based on enrollment rather than attendance and that favored contract slots with providers over parent-directed vouchers.
“When controls are not in place, bad actors can bill for children who aren’t there,” said Alex Adams, HHS assistant secretary for family support. “Families and taxpayers deserve proof that services are being delivered to children. These rule changes emphasize the critical role federal investments in child care play for the American workforce.”
But child-care advocates say a switch to attendance-based billing could push parents out of the workforce and cause child-care centers to close.
In Alabama, child-care subsidies are paid to providers based on enrollment, not attendance, according to the 2025-2027 state plan.
“I’m pretty sure that we have always paid on enrollment, because paying on attendance – it just doesn’t make a lot of sense because the centers’ income would fluctuate drastically,” Gundlach said. “I don’t know how you can operate that way.”
Billing based on enrollment is vital to child-care providers’ financial stability because most of their costs don’t change when children are sporadically absent due to sickness, doctor appointments, family vacations and more, she said. Fixed costs include worker wages, rent or mortgage payments, utility, insurance and tax bills, building maintenance, food expenses and more. Providers typically charge all families, including those who don’t use the subsidy program, based on enrollment vs. attendance to cover these costs, Gundlach said.
“It would be a nightmare if a child doesn’t attend for one day or two days and we’re not getting paid for that,” said Bennett, whose centers receive subsidies for 49 of the 50 children they serve. “That’s ridiculous, because you have to think about it: We’re working with primarily children birth through five. Do you understand how much they get sick? It’s not a viable solution.”
Johnson gives an example of a center with more than five infants enrolled. By law, two teachers would have to be assigned to the infant room in a licensed center. If just three children were present on a given day, only one teacher would be required.
“So now I’ve got to make the decision whether I’m going to send this person home for the day,” Johnson said. “I don’t know how I’m going to pay her because I’m only getting paid for three kids.”
And if absences don’t affect the required teacher-child ratio, sending an employee home isn’t even an option.
If providers were paid subsidies based on actual attendance, the burden to make up the difference in monthly costs initially would fall to parents, said Anita Williams, the Family Guidance Center’s CMA director for Montgomery and Dothan regions.
“And the parent can’t afford to pay the difference,” she said. “That’s why they’re on subsidy.”
Those parents might have to remove their children from care, said Joycelyn Williams of Hoover KinderCare, which receives subsidies for 30% of children in its program. “It would mean a lot of hardship and stress,” she said. “It will cause a lot of problems.”
Alabama already faces a shortage of child-care providers. According to the Buffett Early Childhood Institute at the University of Nebraska, there’s a 41% gap in child-care supply vs. potential need in Alabama.
“That’s going to be trouble on the economy also because a lot of our parents depend on subsidy to go to work or go to school,” Anita Williams said.
The long-term economic impact of Alabama’s current child-care supply gap is between $3.9 billion and $5.9 billion per year, according to the Buffett Early Childhood Institute.
Ultimately, children would suffer if providers closed or their parents couldn’t afford care, Bennett said. Many parents can’t quit work, so their children would likely stay with relatives or neighbors – whoever was available on a given day – with no consistency or educational curriculum, which is required for licensed child-care providers, she said.










I think it would look like a crisis for children. I think it would look like children not receiving educational preparation for pre-K and kindergarten.

“I think it would look like a crisis for children,” Bennett said. “I think it would look like children not receiving educational preparation for pre-K and kindergarten. I think you’ll see behavioral issues as well. A lack of consistency for children, particularly birth through five, is never a good thing.”

Other changes not likely to affect Alabama

Paying child care providers in advance also helps with business stability, Gundlach said, and that was the reasoning the Biden administration gave for the 2024 rule change. Alabama, however, did not implement the upfront payment model, DHR said in its statement. The agency said in its 2025-2027 state plan that it had requested a waiver to give the state more time to implement the policy change.
The state currently pays providers on a three-week delay, Anita Williams said. DHR also did not implement a model to steer clients toward contract providers, the agency’s statement said.
“It remains up to the parents as to which provider they choose for their child(ren),” the statement reads.
Families using the subsidy program are somewhat limited in that they have to choose a provider that participates in the voluntary program. According to DHR, 1,675 of 1,915 licensed centers and licensed home daycares in Alabama participated in the subsidy program as of Dec. 31. Most families who sign up for subsidies have options to choose among, but their selected provider might have a waitlist, Anita Williams said. Because of a severe shortage in rural areas, some families don’t currently have a choice, she said.

What’s next

Once the proposed rules changes are published in the Federal Register, a 30-day public comment period will ensue.After HHS reviews comments, it could publish a final rule, with an effective date 30 days after publication.
Some language in HHS’s press release says states “may” require payment based on verified attendance and “may” provide payment after care is delivered. It’s possible current law doesn’t allow HHS to make the proposed changes mandatory, Gundlach said, which would leave states to decide what route to take.
Wording in the formally proposed rules should provide clarity, she said.
Alabama DHR said it would make changes as necessary to follow federal law. Alabama’s subsidy program operates pursuant to its state plan, which is written to follow federal requirements in place at the time it’s submitted, DHR said.
“If the rescissions are finalized, the state plan will be amended in compliance with the new rules,” the agency’s statement continued.
Shelby said she wishes government officials making those decisions could see things from the perspective of those who will be affected.
“They’re basing everything on money, but not considering the kids’ lives, not considering the help that this actually gives the parents to get up and go to work,” she said. “Everybody always talks about parents sitting at home. We are the working class, just needing the help. It’s our children that affect us most.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Camille-Bennett-for-Jan-26-2026-newsletter-02-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555

(Photo: Michael Lyle/Nevada Current)Clark and Washoe counties are gearing up this week to resume an early-morning count of the number of unsheltered folks in an effort to better grasp the number of people experiencing homelessness. 
Strict guidelines by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development on who should and shouldn’t be included mean the findings won’t reflect a full accounting of people experiencing homelessness and precarious housing. 
The point-in-time-count, a snapshot of homelessness on one particular night in January required by HUD, instructs cities across the country to tally street-level homelessness as well as those staying in temporary emergency shelters and transitional housing. 
Other often overlooked unhoused populations that won’t be reflected in the final numbers include those experiencing homelessness who were incarcerated at the time of the count and unhoused people in emergency rooms and hospitals. 
“There’s an even larger number of people who are in precarious or kind of less than optimal living situations that are not included in the PIT count,” said Catrina Peters, the Homeless Services Coordinator with Washoe County. 
Neither Clark nor Washoe conducted a count of its unsheltered population in 2025. HUD doesn’t require jurisdictions to conduct a full count of its unsheltered population every year, though they are required to provide data of sheltered populations.
The most recent report from HUD found in 2024 homelessness increased by 17% in Nevada, on par with the 20% increase seen across the country.
Southern Nevada’s 2024 PIT count identified 7,906 unhoused people, a 20% increase from the previous year. Washoe County found 1,760 in 2024, which was a 4% increase from the 1,690 found in 2023.
Both jurisdictions think numbers will likely increase this year. 
Even with stringent guidelines from HUD, Clark County is working with neighboring jurisdictions to ensure the number of unsheltered people counted is the most reflective of the population, said Brenda Barnes, social services manager with Clark County. 
The county has refined its counting methodology in recent years to enhance accuracy, but there will “always be an undercount,” Barnes said. 
One reason officials anticipate higher counts this year is an influx of people entering homelessness due to higher rents, Peters said.
As housing becomes less affordable, eviction rates increase, and housing insecurity becomes more prevalent.
“The one data point that continues to persist is that in communities where rent is extremely high, those are the communities that struggle with high homeless rates,” Peters said. “I think it just really brings it all back to the fact that we desperately need to increase the number of affordable housing units in our community.”
Barnes also attributes a part of the increased numbers in previous years to better methodology of counting people.
“I think this year I already assume that our numbers are going to be higher because of the time we’ve taken to do better,” Barnes said.  “If we consistently do better, we’re going to capture more individuals. It doesn’t mean that we’re failing the community in that area. It just means we’re at least doing better accounting for those who are experiencing homelessness.”
Southern Nevada is starting a portion of its count at 3 a.m. within the Corridor of Hope in the City of Las Vegas, the area of downtown Las Vegas with the majority of homeless services and congregate shelters. 
The other deployment sites around Clark County will begin counting around 5 a.m.
Clark County currently has more than 200 volunteers signed up, on par with previous years. The goal this year is to get at least 400 volunteers to ease the counting process. 
Rather than relying on volunteers, Washoe works more deliberately with nonprofits and other homeless service agencies to conduct the count, Peters said. She added this approach is needed especially for hard to reach areas of Washoe that can’t be accessed without four-wheel drive vehicles.  
Some groups of people in unstable housing won’t be reflected in the data when it’s released later in the year. 
“We have folks who are in situations like maybe they’re living in a hotel room, maybe they’re doubled up with family,” Peters said. “Those don’t meet the HUD definitions of homelessness, but are definitely folks who are in very precarious living situations.”
Members of the Southern Nevada Continuum of Care Board, a coalition of government agencies and nonprofits, are exploring doing a separate tally of those incarcerated, Barnes said. Nothing has been finalized and it won’t be conducted during Thursday’s count. 
Because HUD has specific reporting guidelines, counties usually limit data collection during the PIT count to what is specifically required or mandated. 
“We’re making sure that everything is aligned with specifically the requirements of HUD and HUD standards, not asking anything too far beyond that, just given, given the landscape that we’re in,” Barnes said. 
The Trump Administration has increased rhetoric attacking the transgender community since returning to office in 2025.
One of the HUD changes was around data collection for PIT included restricting questions around gender ideology, Barnes said.
While the question will be optional for volunteers to ask, the county won’t be including those results on trans people experiencing homelessness in their final report to HUD, Barnes said. 
Washoe also plans to ask the question and include the data in the county’s final HUD report. 
The PIT count is returning for the first count since the majority of jurisdictions have enacted  anti-homeless camping bans that restrict and criminalize people from sleeping, camping and living in cars. 
Neither county official was entirely sure what type of impact that could have on identifying the unhoused.
Clark County, Barnes said, had since expanded non-congregate shelters, adding there are more options for people to go when encampments are cleared. 
“I think we’re going to see an increase in sheltered homelessness just because of some of the breakup of the encampments,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/imageedit_1_4591747131-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555

I remembered this last week after the Alabama House Democrats outlined their priorities for the 2026 session. It wasn’t an explicit campaign event, but you wouldn’t be wrong to make the connection.
They talked about slashing Alabama’s nation-leading levels of gun violence. Making voting easier. And most of all, improving affordability.
This is all reasonable. The narrative is that President Donald Trump got reelected in 2024 because the price of eggs mattered more to voters than felony convictions and blatant racism. And if Democrats do well this year, the polls say, a growing disappointment with Trump’s handling of the economy will play a big role.
So Democrats, including likely Alabama gubernatorial nominee Doug Jones, are leaning into it.
And it would seem to give them an edge. Alabama Republicans, after cutting grocery taxes while blaming inflation on President Joe Biden, have fallen silent on the issue. The GOP-controlled Legislature is in a hurry to get the budgets passed and get its members back on the campaign trail. Beyond raises for state employees and some efforts to avoid cost increases in their insurance plans next year, there’s really not anything from the party addressing food prices, electricity prices or housing.
But even if these issues are popular, we all know they may not matter in November.  Republicans often need to do little more than be Republicans to win office.
This is partly structural. When qualifying closed on Friday, Democrats had candidates in 21 of the state’s 35 Senate districts and 54 of the state’s 105 House districts.  It’s fine to run on issues that matter to people. But many Alabama voters won’t hear the pitch this year.
But it’s also obvious that Republicans feel no need to talk about actual issues in Alabama. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, our supposed gubernatorial inevitability, has been spending much of his time attacking Muslim Americans. He recently criticized Virginia’s new lieutenant governor for taking her oath of office on a copy of the Quran.
And up and down the Republican state candidate list, you will find an obsession with immigration and voter fraud, two things that are not happening to any significant extent in our state.
If Republicans thought affordability would make or break the 2026 election, odds are we’d be hearing a lot more on the topic from the Legislature. But we’re not. GOP candidates have decided that they can focus on the religious convictions of Virginians more than the daily struggles of Alabamians.
And for now, it’s a good bet. Look who casts ballots in Alabama.
Over the past 16 years, Alabama voters have elected lawmakers who terrorize immigrants. Who attack transgender youth. Legislators who put pregnant women in danger. And put all of us at higher risk of getting shot.
In the face of this cruelty, these lawmakers keep returning to office.
You can say that Alabamians deserve the poor governance that results from electing leaders who prioritize baseless rage. But this is too simplistic. Most Alabamians aren’t going to the polls. Just 37% of eligible voters cast ballots in the 2022 election. The number of registered voters in Alabama who sat out the 2024 presidential election (1.8 million) was larger than Trump’s vote total in the state (1.46 million).
Some of that nonparticipation comes from the obstacles Republicans have thrown up to voting in recent years. But a good part of it stems from a lack of choices and a feeling that casting a ballot is pointless. The profoundly pathetic campaigns of 2022 — with Democrats struggling to outraise Libertarians and Republicans bullying immigrants and transgender youth — certainly gave Alabamians reasons to sit the election out.
That’s where the opportunity for Alabama Democrats lies. Not in peeling off Republican votes, which seems unlikely. Democrats have to pull those alienated voters back to the polls. To restore their faith in voting as a positive act. And to accept the Democrats as a viable vehicle for governance.
It’s a lot to ask for a party that’s still trying to find its feet in the state. All too often, a vote for a Democrat feels like a waste in a solidly red state.
But the path to an Alabama government that actually reflects the needs of the state — whatever party it may be — means pulling the disaffected voters back into the process. And taking it back from those who use the ballot as a cudgel.
Otherwise, we’ll keep our miserable disconnect between what Alabamians want and what state government gives them.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Huntsville-voters-for-Nov-8-2024-story.jpg,,,2026-01-26 08:56:35.583555
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-26 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How will CDC vaccine schedule changes affect CT residents?,Laura Tillman and Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/26/cdc-vaccine-schedule-changes-ct/,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced updates to its recommendations for childhood vaccines. Here's what to know.,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced updates to its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Jan. 5. In the aftermath, Connecticut elected officials have been communicating the implications to the public, including assuring parents who may be confused about how the changes affect their child’s scheduled vaccinations.
Here’s what to know about the changes and how they impact the way vaccinations are done and paid for in Connecticut.
What changes were made to the CDC’s childhood vaccine recommendations?
At the end of 2024, the CDC’s childhood vaccination schedule recommended 17 immunizations for all children. On Jan. 5, that changed to 11 broadly recommended vaccines: diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV), and chickenpox. 
Some vaccines are recommended to high risk groups: RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, two types of bacterial meningitis, and dengue. Finally, the CDC says that for children who are not high risk, the decision as to whether to administer vaccines for rotavirus, COVID, the flu, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and bacterial meningitis should be left up to “shared clinical decision-making,” or conversations between people and their doctors. 
The CDC’s recommendations are not requirements and families have a choice as to whether they continue to follow the previous vaccine schedule, the new recommendations, or some combination of the two.
Why were these changes made? 
Major changes to leadership have been made over the past year at the Department of Health and Human Services, including to the panel of experts that provides recommendations on vaccines. Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr has long promoted views that cast doubt on the safety of vaccines. He has also advanced the idea that vaccines are linked to climbing autism rates, although the majority of health experts say there is no proven link between vaccines and autism. 
In December, President Donald Trump directed HHS to align the childhood vaccine schedule with peer advice and the schedule of other developed countries. The new recommendations are more closely aligned with Denmark’s schedule, according to HHS, but U.S. experts say the comparison is misguided since the two countries have little in common when it comes to the spread of preventable diseases like hepatitis B.
How have Connecticut officials responded? 
Connecticut Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani, along with other public health officials, have affirmed that Connecticut’s vaccine recommendations have not changed. That means children must be fully up to date on the Connecticut vaccine schedule to enroll in public school, a list identical to the previous federal schedule. 
No religious exemptions are allowed; only medical exemptions via a certificate from a health care provider allow children enrolled in Connecticut public schools to forgo vaccines.
Will my insurance still pay for childhood vaccinations that are no longer recommended by the CDC? 
In short, yes. In a fact sheet published recently, the federal government clarified that, despite the recommendation changes, all vaccines would continue to be available to anyone who wants them through Affordable Care Act plans, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and the Vaccines for Children program. 
“Families will not have to purchase them out of pocket. Among peer nations, the U.S. will continue to offer the most childhood vaccines for free to those who want them,” stated the fact sheet.
Interim state insurance commissioner Josh Hershman reiterated this message to Connecticut residents on Jan. 6. 
“The vaccines referenced in the CDC announcement were not removed from the immunization schedule. Instead, they were moved from a routine recommendation to clinical decision-making recommendation,” Hershman stated. “Because these vaccines remain on the CDC schedule, they continue to be covered by health insurance plans regulated by the CID.”
However, KFF Health News has reported that because the CDC has changed its recommendation for the HPV vaccine from two doses to one, insurance companies are no longer required to cover the second dose. 
Why does it matter if the CDC changes its recommendations?
According to health care professionals, including Juthani, the changes to the vaccine schedule have a number of concerning repercussions. For one, some of the vaccines  that are no longer recommended by the CDC can prevent diseases that cause serious illness and even death.
There are also concerns, officials say, that the motivations for changing the schedule are misguided and based on bad science. 
While all 17 vaccines are still required for students enrolled in Connecticut public schools, some families outside of that system may opt-out. As federal authorities and states diverge on their recommendations, communities may see a resurgence of preventable illnesses like hepatitis B, which is easily spread through bodily fluids. “Remember all 17 of these diseases are worth protecting your child against,” Juthani said at a press conference on Jan. 12.
“We really don’t need to go backwards,” said Dr. Robert Dudley, a longtime pediatrician of the Community Health Center of New Britain, recalling a serious RSV season he saw at the beginning of his career. “We don’t want to see those days, nothing made me happier than seeing a vaccine come out that mothers could take, infants could take, people over 50 could take to keep them from getting this horrible disease.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP24248694401334-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Two Democrats who joined the state Assembly last week are the first in decades to represent Hudson County without the backing of the powerful party organization.
Assembly members Ravi Bhalla and Katie Brennan ran for the Assembly last June in a six-person race that saw them defeating two opponents who had the support of the Hudson County Democratic Organization and one incumbent assemblywoman. They cruised to victory in November in the largely Democratic 32nd Legislative District, which includes Hoboken and parts of Jersey City.
Bhalla and Brennan say they’re focused on addressing issues like housing and transparency, rather than playing party politics.
“At the end of the day, we’re all Democrats. I want to be a team player, and I want to make sure that we can work together to advance common objectives,” said Bhalla.
Union County Democrats who flipped GOP Assembly seats eye affordability

The district is represented in the state Senate by Sen. Raj Mukherji, a Democrat who backed two of Bhalla’s and Brennan’s opponents in last June’s primary. Bhalla and Brennan say they’ve put the primary in the rearview mirror and already have several initiatives they want to work on with Mukherji, including his plans to reintroduce two immigrant protection bills that were vetoed last week by outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy.
“We’re all adults, and we’ve all had jobs. Sometimes you don’t agree with people. Sometimes it’s rough,” Brennan said. “I, believe it or not, don’t relish being a kind of flamethrower. I really just want to get things done, and I think that Raj is ready to work with us on that.”
Mukherji called Bhalla and Brennan both “intellectuals,” and said the three have the potential to be one of the strongest delegations in the Legislature.
“The world has changed so much since the politics of a primary a year ago. Our democracy is in a state of disrepair,” Mukherji said.

Bhalla is an attorney who was elected Hoboken mayor in 2017 after previously serving on the city’s council for two terms. He’s garnered national attention for the square-mile city’s Vision Zero project, which has resulted in zero pedestrian deaths since 2017.
He said his first priority now is economic justice for marginalized communities. He wants to explore whether the state could provide a guaranteed basic income, create more incentives to boost the construction of affordable housing, and build more resilient climate infrastructure across the Garden State.
For years, storms in Hudson County meant widespread flooding in Hoboken, and Bhalla says that through resiliency projects, flooding risks have been reduced so they are weeks or months apart now instead of days.
“That’s done through innovation, and that innovation can be applied through other parts of the state,” he said.

Brennan is bringing a different background to the Golden Dome in Trenton. A Jersey City resident, she built her career in housing policy and previously worked at the state Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. She’s also been an advocate for survivors of sexual assault.
In 2018, she went public with claims that she was raped by a fellow member of Murphy’s campaign team and that the campaign and state officials failed to properly investigate her case. During the primary last year, one of her campaign ads said she would “turn my experience into our results.”
Brennan said she, like Bhalla, wants to back housing initiatives in the Assembly. The two have already worked on a bill that would call for a statewide right to counsel for housing issues, and they plan to tackle “unconscionable” rent increases. She also wants to beef up transit, particularly in South Jersey.
Brennan called herself a “proud progressive” in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, but said her experience in government agencies has also led her to be practical.
“I think there is a mandate that everybody has now of recognizing the need for affordability. And voters in general — they just want to see stuff get done,” she said. “I know that words matter, things being funded matters, and it matters how it’s being implemented.”

Chad Gibbs, College of Charleston
Joe Engel was and remains an icon in Charleston, South Carolina. Born in Zakroczym, Poland, he survived Auschwitz and several other concentration camps and fought with the resistance before landing on American shores as a refugee in 1949.
After retirement from his dry-cleaning business, Engel focused his later years on Holocaust education.
As part of these efforts, he took to sitting on downtown park benches wearing a name tag that read “Joe Engel, Holocaust Survivor: Ask me questions” — becoming the city’s first public memorial to the victims of Nazi genocide.
Knowing he would not be here to impart his message forever, Engel and his friend and fellow survivor Pincus Kolender led a drive to install the permanent memorial that now stands in Charleston’s Marion Square park.
In 2021, I moved to the city to take up my role as a professor and director of Holocaust studies at the College of Charleston. I arrived just in time to meet Engel and to teach many local students who had met him.
He died the following year, at age 95.
For years, historians, educators and Jewish groups have been considering how to teach about the Holocaust after the survivors have passed on. Few of today’s college students have ever met a Holocaust survivor.
Those who have likely met a child survivor, with few personal memories before 1945. American veterans of the war are almost entirely unknown to our present students; many know nothing of their own family connections to World War II.
Time marches on, distance grows, and what we call “common knowledge” changes.
One alarming study from 2018 revealed that 45% of American adults could not identify a single one of the over 40,000 Nazi camps and ghettos, while 41% of younger Americans believe that Nazi Germany killed substantially less than 6 million Jews during the Holocaust.
According to a 2025 study by the Claims Conference, there are somewhat more than 200,000 survivors still alive, though their median age is 87. It is sadly expected that 7 in 10 will pass away within the next decade.
With their absence near, how can educators and community members bring this history home, decreasing the perceived distance between the students of today and the lessons of the Holocaust?
Bringing history home
One method that shows promise is helping students realize the connections of their own home and their own time to a genocide that might seem far away — both on the map and in the mind.
A letter dated Dec. 27, 1938, sent from Malie Landsmann to her cousin Minnie Tewel Baum of South Carolina. (Photo courtesy of the Jewish Heritage Collection, Addlestone Library, College of Charleston)
In classes on the Holocaust, I now use a set of letters sent by a family of Polish Jews to their relatives in Camden, South Carolina.
The letters themselves are powerful sources demonstrating the increasing desperation of Malie Landsmann, the main writer. In 1938, she reached out to her cousin Minnie Tewel Baum, seeking help to escape Adolf Hitler’s Germany.
Even though the two had never met, Minnie tried everything to help her cousin and her family.
In the end, however, she was not successful.
American immigration barriers and murderous Nazi policy took their toll, with Malie, her husband, Chaim, and their two children, Ida and Peppi, all killed at Auschwitz.
These haunting letters demonstrate the connections of the war to small-town South Carolina. They give the Holocaust a real human face and a connection to places students know.
Letter collections like these are not rare. The College of Charleston holds a second, far larger group of letters, the Helen Stern Lipton Papers, which runs to over 170 pages of correspondence between family members in South Carolina, German-occupied Europe, Russia and even Central Asia.
When I was a doctorate student, I participated in classes using the Sara Spira postcards sent from a series of ghettos in Poland to rural Wisconsin. Further archives exist all over the United States. Most communities have connections to the Holocaust, whether via artifacts, people with direct ties or both.
The important thing is to teach in ways that can break down the mental barriers created by time and space. It is indeed the same reason that the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum created a traveling exhibit called “Auschwitz. Not Long Ago. Not Far Away.”
Learning from descendants
As teachers and professors attempt to bridge these divides, they often invite the descendants of Holocaust survivors to their classes to speak.
Descendants can retell the stories of their parents’ or ancestors’ perseverance and survival, but what is more important is their ability to put a human face on these events and show how they remain relevant in the lives of so many.

I take these short visits a step further in a class where students train as oral history interviewers, then conduct recorded conversations with a descendant of survivors.
These meetings encourage discussion of family Holocaust history, but only after the student asks the descendant about how they learned about what happened to their parent, grandparent or great-grandparent, and how this might have weighed on their own life years after the war.
This is truly the point here. The most impactful parts of these recordings are almost always the discussions of legacies, of how the families that students meet still live with the enormity of Holocaust trauma.
When a descendant tells students about the past, that is important. But when a descendant speaks of what that past means for them, their family and their community, that is so much more.
Students gain firsthand knowledge of intergenerational trauma; the difficulties of rebuilding; the prevalence of anxiety, worry and depression in survivor homes; and so much more.
All of this shows students in no uncertain ways how the Holocaust still has bearing on the lives of people in our communities.
History after memory: a path forward
What’s most heartening about these methods and their successes is what they reveal about what today’s students value.

In the age of artificial intelligence, Big Tech and omnipresent social media, I believe it is still — and maybe even more than ever — the real human connection.
Students are drawn in by the local connections and open up to the stories of real people, brought to them in person. Often, they launch their own research to better understand the letters.
One of my students even helped turn them into classroom materials, now used well beyond our own college.
Another did the painstaking work to have four new Stolpersteine, or Stumbling Stone, memorials installed in Berlin to commemorate the Landsmann family.
Never having witnessed them myself, I can only imagine the impact of Joe Engel’s conversations on those park benches in downtown Charleston.
Nothing will ever truly replace the voices of the survivors, but I believe teachers and communities can carry on his work by making history feel local and personal.
As everything around us seems to show each day, little could be more important than the lessons of these people, their sources and the Holocaust.

(Getty Images)Indiana’s Senate Enrolled Act 1 of 2025 delivered what many voters have wanted for years: lower property taxes. Homeowners received higher deductions, but businesses — especially those with substantial personal property — saw significant reductions in tax liability.  
Let’s compare the two. A family who owns a $400,000 house would see a $300 cut, the maximum, each year. A business that owns $400,000 worth of personal property would see their taxes cut by $12,000 a year.  
In the short run, these changes might be popular. In the long run, however, they will likely weaken municipal governments across the state and undermine the very economic growth the law was meant to encourage.
Property taxes are not simply another revenue source. They are the primary funding mechanism for local government in Indiana. Police and fire protection, street maintenance, parks, libraries, and much of public education depend on property tax revenue. When those revenues fall, local governments do not gain new efficiencies by default; they lose capacity.
SEA 1 reduces assessed values and effective tax rates across much of the property tax base. While the legislation phases in these changes, the cumulative effect is substantial. Cities and towns will collect significantly less revenue over the coming decade, even after accounting for modest economic growth. This is not speculative. Local fiscal officers across Indiana have already projected sizable structural deficits as the law takes effect.










While homeowners receive modest, broadly distributed relief, the most dramatic change are sweeping business tax cuts.


– Michael Hicks


The design of SEA 1 matters. While homeowners receive modest, broadly distributed relief, the most dramatic change are sweeping business tax cuts. In many communities, this removes a large share of the commercial tax base entirely. The result is a sharp decline in taxable value that cannot be offset by growth alone.
Supporters of the law argue that local governments can replace lost revenue through local income taxes. That option exists, but it is far from costless. Local income taxes are paid by workers, not property owners, and they are far more sensitive to economic cycles. Communities with slower job growth or lower incomes will struggle to raise sufficient revenue, even at higher rates. Others will simply choose not to increase taxes, forcing cuts instead.
These tradeoffs are not evenly distributed. Large cities with diverse tax bases may absorb some of the loss. Small cities and towns cannot. For many rural and mid-sized communities, even modest revenue reductions translate into fewer police officers, delayed infrastructure maintenance, or closed public facilities. Over time, those cuts accumulate.
The economic consequences of this erosion are well-documented. Public safety, infrastructure quality, and school performance are among the strongest predictors of local economic growth. Businesses do not locate in places with crumbling roads, understaffed emergency services, or struggling schools simply because taxes are low. They locate where public services are reliable and labor markets are strong.
Indiana school leaders warn property tax reforms are destabilizing public education budgets

The fallout of this will happen fairly soon. I expect close to 100 municipal governments will declare fiscal emergencies because personnel cuts will be so dramatic. But, there is a grimly humorous side of this. The number of Indiana local government employees is near a record low, and lower than in every year before 2020 for which we have data.  
This brings us to education. While the state now provides most operating funding for K-12 schools, property taxes still play a critical role in capital projects and transportation. Reduced local revenue means deferred maintenance, fewer facility upgrades, and growing disparities between districts. Over time, this affects workforce quality—Indiana’s most important long-term economic asset.
The lesson here is not that tax relief is inherently harmful. Indiana’s earlier property tax reforms succeeded because they were paired with stable replacement revenues and realistic assessments of local fiscal capacity. SEA 1 breaks from that tradition. It cuts deeply into the local tax base without providing a durable, statewide mechanism to replace what is lost.
Fiscal policy is ultimately about tradeoffs. Lower property taxes today mean fewer public services tomorrow. If those services are central to economic growth—and they are—then the policy choice becomes clearer. Indiana has managed to a few hundred dollars per household in the short run at the cost of weaker communities and slower growth in the years ahead.
The second grimly funny aspect of this is that with these lopsided property tax cuts, local governments are going to have to raise local income taxes.  SEA1 was hastily put together, and relied so heavily on a study that favored business interest over objective fact.  The result was a huge business tax cut that will almost surely cause an overall tax increase for most families.  
Hoosier families need to think long and hard about the fallout of SEA1, and have some frank conversations with both businesses and legislators about the state’s future.

Pictured: capture and storage facilities in Bergen, Norway, on Dec. 16, 2024. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images)Hoosier leaders plan to take over federal review of a pipeline of contentious projects to inject carbon dioxide deep underground.
Nine applications for Indiana sites are before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to an agency tracker of Class VI permits.
They’re one of six classes of wells the EPA regulates under an Underground Injection Control program, for substances like oil, gas and now, the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide.
CO2 capture and storage proposals have faced intense local opposition in Indiana.
‘Too many unknowns’: As company forges on with carbon sequestration project, residents mobilize

A bill under consideration by the Indiana General Assembly would require the Department of Natural Resources’ autonomous board to seek primary enforcement authority over Class VI wells. House Bill 1368 also outlines a state-level regulatory scheme.
“Wherever you stand on sequestration … First of all, we want to keep Indiana competitive, bring in business and jobs,” said Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso.
“Second of all, we want to be prepared to pivot with whatever happens in Washington, because Washington has been like a pendulum on a clock and it’s bouncing off the sides,” he said.
Soliday, the bill’s author, spoke during a committee hearing last week that featured enthusiastic industry testimony.
But some skeptics fear the state isn’t fully equipped to carry it out.
Primacy’s popularity
Six states already hold primary enforcement authority for Class VI wells, according to an EPA table: Arizona, Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming.
“They have to demonstrate that they will administer the program up to the standards that EPA, the federal government, would do it,” said Janet McCabe, a visiting professor at Indiana University and a former EPA deputy administrator.
An increasing number of states are considering joining.


As of October, Alaska was involved in primacy pre-application activities, while Colorado was working on proposed rulemaking, per an EPA graphic. Six others were in pre-application to revise their programs to include Class VI primacy: Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah.
Some successful Class VI applications took months, while others took years.
“Procedurally, it would follow the same steps” as other well types, McCabe said, “but how the wells would be used would dictate the kind of information that you would need.”
“If you’re going to be using a well to extract oil and gas, people have been doing that for years … and that’s a relatively straightforward and well-understood process,” she continued. “But storing CO2 underground is new, the technology is new. It just hasn’t been done as much. And there are all kinds of other questions that come into play.”
Timelines, proximity
One Indiana project has already obtained a Class VI permit: Wabash Valley Resources, which plans to produce ammonia fertilizer at a a former coal gasification plant — and pump the emissions underground. It’s a pilot with its own state laws and rules.
Others want in, too.
Sequestration would allow ethanol producers, for instance, to “fulfil(l) global and domestic demand for cleaner fuels,” said Tim Phelps, a lobbyist with Hathaway Strategies, who represented the Indiana Ethanol Producers Association in committee.
“While thorough review is vital to the public interest,” he said, the application process under the EPA has been “inconsistent,” causing “significant delays.”
“We are supportive of initiatives which seek to streamline this permitting process, to allow these projects — which involve significant investments of time and capital — to come to fruition,” Phelps said.
Association member POET, which bills itself as the world’s largest producer of bioethanol, is pursing Class VI permits at each of its five Indiana plants.

“We … support any effort to streamline permitting timelines,” said Hamilton Smith, a lobbyist for Ice Miller representing POET.
DNR has also made the case for pace.
“By accepting primacy for Class VI permitting, Indiana will be best positioned to work with all stakeholders to ensure that applications are reviewed with speed and efficiency, following all federal and state regulations,” spokesman Marty Benson said. 
“Instead of relying upon an out-of-state regulator, questions can be addressed by DNR staff in Indiana,” he added — an argument industry leaders echoed.
“Generally, we prefer working with DNR,” said Mark Shublak, a Taft law firm partner representing fuel company CountryMark.
He cited familiarity with the agency’s handling of oil and gas wells, hopes staff would process applications “timely,” and accessibility to “Indiana market participants.”
Home ties also played into DNR General Counsel Stephanie Flittner’s testimony.
Primacy would “ensur(e) these decisions are made in Indiana — closer to Indiana geology, Indiana communities and Indiana stakeholders,” she said.
Trust, resources
Others are skeptical of a switch.
Kerwin Olson, the executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said his ratepayer advocacy organization and peers think agencies like DNR can be too lax.
“Us and many others have sort of viewed Indiana environmental authorities as, you know, nothing more than pay-to-play sort of permit-issuing agencies,” he said. They worry the “streamlined” timeline a firm may seek could come at a cost.

“There’s a reason for that bureaucracy, those regulations, because there’s significant risk with these commercial facilities, and a thorough review with expertise is a good thing,” Olson said.
That’s not to say he had the utmost confidence in even the EPA.
“There’s permits that have been issued that we thought never should have been issued,” he said. “So I don’t know that it’s that we have any more confidence, per se, in outcomes at the EPA … but it’s a matter of staffing levels, expertise, resources, time.”
DNR’s Benson said staff “do not anticipate a fiscal impact” from running a Class VI program, noting the agency already has primacy for oil and gas wells. He also cited that experience in defending personnel “expertise and professionalism.”

An additional 1,500 active duty troops from the army’s 11th Airborne Division are on standby, ready for deployment to Minnesota. 
Let’s put that in perspective. During the last year of his first term, President Trump negotiated a full withdrawal from Afghanistan, which at the time was a nation of 39 million people, to be completed in early 2021. In 2019, there were between 12,000 and 13,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. At the start of the Biden administration, there were only 2,500 U.S. soldiers remaining there. 
I say this because the Trump administration has decided to send more armed federal agents to the Twin Cities than Joe Biden inherited in Afghanistan. That’s too many armed federal agents under any circumstances. 
Two U.S. citizens have already been killed who would be alive today absent the occupation. Many U.S. citizens have been detained and physically abused, and many more such instances have been endured by legally authorized immigrants. 
We are about to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The Founders of the United States were intensely suspicious of standing armies in peace time. If they were British citizens, the colonists asked, why were the Red Coats stationed in Boston? They included, among their reasons for dissolving their ties to King George, the following:
“He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.”  
In 1787, at the Constitutional Convention, future President James Madison made the following observation: 
“A standing military force, with an overgrown executive will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.” 
It was clear to the nation’s Founders that federal forces were meant to fight foreign enemies and defend the United States from other nations. Among their first actions after the end of the Revolutionary War was to disband the Continental Army. Federal forces were never meant to occupy American cities and rural areas. 
Some might suggest that the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States constitute a foreign invasion. Hogwash. The undocumented here come from many nations and arrived for as many reasons. It was not and is not an organized foreign invasion. 
U.S. federal forces are meant to protect us from foreign threats, not to occupy the streets and farms of America in unmarked cars and wearing masks and picking up people without judicial warrants based on how they look, or speak, or what neighborhood they live in, or how they get to work, or where they work. 
What is happening in Minnesota is un-American. It would make the Founders wonder what has become of their project.

Texas was the top source of new residents for Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Oklahoma, according to the 2024 state-to-state migration flows, which track where someone lived in the previous year and where they currently live. The Census Bureau released the numbers last week.
With 31 million residents, Texas ranks second in population among U.S. states. Between 2020 and 2024, Texas gained 2.1 million people.
“The obvious and primary answer is size,” said Dudley Poston, professor emeritus of sociology at Texas A&M University. “There’s got to be more people leaving Texas than leaving other states because of the population size of Texas.”
Thousands of Mississippians are also migrating to Texas. Roughly 5,500 people moved from Hinds County, Mississippi, to the Lone Star State from 2017 to 2022, according to Internal Revenue Service data analyzed by researcher Jake McGraw at Rethink Mississippi. McGraw, who conducted the analysis for Mississippi Today, said Dallas and Houston were the top destinations for the relocating Mississippians. 
Other large producers of residents who moved to other states included the nation’s other most populous states: California, Florida and New York.
California, the most populous U.S. state with 39 million residents, supplied the most new residents to the western states of Arizona, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Texas and Washington. But it also was the top supplier of domestic residents to Tennessee, home to Nashville, which has established a pipeline to Southern California’s entertainment industry.
Florida, the third most populous U.S. state with 23 million residents, dominated the number of new residents in the southeast states of Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina but also Ohio. Florida has gained 1.8 million residents this decade, the second most of any state.
Although the Sunshine State’s size played a primary role, other factors may be involved too, such as Florida’s escalating real estate and homeowners’ insurance prices and the more plentiful job opportunities for recent college graduates in cities like Atlanta and Charlotte, according to Richard Doty, a research demographer at the University of Florida.
“It is no longer as affordable a relocation/ retirement option as it once was,” Doty said in an email.
New York was the top source of new residents in Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts and New Jersey, while Illinois provided the most new residents for Midwestern neighbors Indiana, Iowa and Wisconsin.
“The states with the largest out-migration numbers — California, Florida, Texas, and New York — are also the states with the largest populations. That’s not a coincidence,” said Helen You, interim director of the Texas Demographic Center. “Large populations naturally generate large volumes of both in-and-out migrants.”
Some migration patterns were no real surprises, such as former Massachusetts residents being the biggest source of new Mainers, New Hampshirites, Rhode Islanders and Vermonters. Former Wisconsinites made up the largest number of new Minnesotans, and former North Carolinians were the biggest source of new South Carolina residents.
In most states in 2024, before the immigration crackdown of the second Trump administration, people arriving from a foreign country were the top source of new residents. Among the exceptions, where international migration wasn’t large compared to people moving from individual U.S. states, were Idaho, Kansas, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/23182418/AP26022521514192.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Majority Democrats in the state Legislature are pushing changes they say will restore integrity to Washington’s venerable initiative process.
Opponents contend the moves will effectively block residents’ direct path to the ballot to pass laws of their own making.
Bills introduced in the House and Senate would bar paying a person for each signature they collect. And they would allow legal action against those suspected of violations.
The legislation also would add a new step at the front end of the process by requiring a person, at the time they fill out paperwork and pay the fee for an initiative, to also submit signatures of 1,000 registered voters as a show of support for a proposed measure. 
The debate, which played out in Senate and House committees last week, appears to be a byproduct of Democrats’ and their allies’ vexation with Let’s Go Washington and its multi-millionaire founder Brian Heywood.
Two years ago, the conservative political group, largely underwritten with Heywood’s money, sent six initiatives to the Legislature, each aiming to repeal or revise a major policy enacted into law by Democrats over the objections of Republicans.
Two more dealing with parental rights and transgender athletes are on track to reach the ballot this year. Democratic leaders say they won’t hold hearings on this year’s measures.
Sen. Javier Valdez, D-Seattle, said he drew up Senate Bill 5973 out of concern that this form of direct democracy has been co-opted by big money interests.
“Anyone with enough money to bankroll their way through the initiative qualifying process can force statewide votes on any issue that’s personal to them,” he said at a hearing on the bill in the Senate Committee on State Government, Tribal Affairs and Elections. Valdez is the committee chair.
The allure of making money for each signature incentivizes gatherers to use “aggressive, misleading tactics” to pad their totals to boost their compensation, he said.
Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma, sponsor of the House legislation, said initiatives are a powerful tool of the citizenry and the bill is about making the initiative process “more perfect.” 
“It is more important to me that the initiative process remains accessible to members of the community to exercise their power and their voice,” she said at a public hearing of the House State Government and Tribal Relations Committee that she chairs. 
Former Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican, denounced the legislation as a “voter suppression bill.” 
“It’s an attempt to make it even more difficult for citizens to participate in the government process. You’re doing this because you think there’s fraud? Frankly, you’re wrong,” he said.
Secretary of State Steve Hobbs, a Democrat, opposes the legislation, saying it would further burden those pursuing an initiative.
He told lawmakers he’s responded to concerns about frivolous filings with steps like hiking the fee to $156 from $5. If there’s concern with misbehaving signature gatherers, increase penalties for breaking the law, he said.
On Friday, the Senate committee advanced Valdez’s bill on a 4-3 party-line vote. Before the vote, they removed the requirement for 1,000 signatures for referendums, which send bills approved by the Legislature to the ballot.
Republican senators offered 12 amendments, most seeking to remove the requirement for pre-filed signatures or prescribe limits on citizens taking legal action over alleged violations. They did not oppose the ban on paying by signature. Democrats rejected them all.
“Basically, I hate this bill with a passion,” said Sen. Phil Fortunato, R-Auburn, author of half the amendments.
Sen. Bob Hasegawa, D-Tukwila, teetered but said that while he didn’t like the mandate for providing 1,000 signatures upfront, removing the potential issues created with the pay-per-signature method needs addressing.
“I hate raising barriers to the (initiative) process but I think getting money out of politics is the most important thing right now,” he said, before voting for the bill.
Let’s Go Washington’s Heywood told the Senate panel that because Democrats have been unable to deter or derail the group’s endeavors, they came up with this bill to “destroy the process.”
There’s no evidence of fraud with signature-gatherers, he said. “We have no incentive to pay for invalid signatures because it’s wasted money.”
House Bill 2259, sponsored by Mena, received a hearing last Wednesday. No date for a committee vote has been announced.
Checking addresses
This isn’t the only Democrat-sponsored bill targeting the initiative process.
House Bill 2260 would add a requirement for individuals gathering signatures to sign each petition they submit.
It also directs the Secretary of State’s Office to verify that the residence address listed by the person signing a petition matches the address on their voter registration. Adding this chore will nearly halve the number of signatures verified per hour, according to the secretary of state.
At a hearing Wednesday, supporters said the bill will provide much-needed accountability for signature collection. Opponents, including Hobbs and Reed, said it could lead to petitions getting tossed out simply because a legal voter moved at some point after signing.
As part of the verification process, the state does a 3% random sample of submitted signatures for accuracy. Address verification would be added to that process, so not every submitted signature will need to be checked.
A fiscal analysis projects it will cost $3 million this budget and $4.78 million in future bienniums to pay for added staff and equipment.
This bill has not been scheduled for a committee vote and there is currently no companion bill in the Senate.
Hundreds of thousands of signatures are required to qualify either an initiative to the Legislature or one for the ballot. Work is now underway to verify signatures and certify two Let’s Go Washington-sponsored measures for this fall’s election. 
Supporters turned in 30,717 pages of petitions containing 418,666 signatures for IL26-001 focused on parental rights, the secretary of state’s office reported. There were 32,078 pages and 444,434 signatures for IL26-638 to bar transgender athletes from girls’ sports. 
On Thursday, the secretary of state notified lawmakers that certification of the latter measure was done.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Heywood-Hobbs-Reed-1-1024x764.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

In short: Gridlock in the Senate. Scandal in the House.
Senate Democrats entered the year divided after a contentious leadership fight. But the 10-member caucus appears to have coalesced around a simple two-pronged strategy: absolute opposition to increasing the sales tax and a willingness to slow the Senate to a crawl.
Normally, opposing tax increases would put Democrats squarely on Republican turf. This year, it’s the Republican governor pushing a plan that would move Missouri away from income taxes and toward higher sales taxes — a change Democrats argue would shift the tax burden onto the working poor.
Democrats have also taken aim at the Senate’s pace. So far, they have delayed the only official business the chamber has attempted this year, twice filibustering to block votes on gubernatorial appointments.
Part of the obstruction is payback. Last year, Republicans invoked a rarely used rule four times to cut off debate and push through bills repealing expanded paid sick leave, gerrymandering the state’s congressional map, changing the initiative petition process, and reimposing an abortion ban.
But Democrats are also using the gridlock to argue that the GOP supermajority has been moving too fast and making costly mistakes. A handful of examples have become staples of Democratic filibusters.
A wildly inaccurate cost estimate for legislation eliminating the capital gains tax. A Kansas City precinct placed in two different congressional districts in the gerrymandered map. A $250 million mistake in state budget estimates released earlier this month. Drafting errors in two different income tax cut proposals.
What happens next? If Democrats don’t stand down, the nominees will either have to be withdrawn by early next month or face being barred from holding those appointments for life.
Republicans aren’t naïve. They knew a smooth session was unlikely after last year. How they choose to break the logjam remains an open question.
Meanwhile, in the Missouri House, an overwhelming bipartisan majority voted last week to punish Democratic state Rep. Jeremy Dean for obscene text messages he sent to Republican Rep. Cecelie Williams.
Only 10 Democrats voted against sanctions: Doug Clemons, Aaron Crossley, Anthony Ealy, Elizabeth Fuchs, Jeff Hales, Kerri Ingle, Ian Mackey, Ray Reed, Del Taylor and Wick Thomas.
The punishment includes removal from committees, mandatory sexual harassment training and a requirement that Dean stay at least 50 feet away from Williams.
In a short speech before the vote, Williams said the sanctions did not go far enough, noting that at any other job “a message like that would be grounds for immediate termination, no questions asked.”
Dean, she said, targeted her despite knowing her history as a domestic abuse survivor. His apology was half-hearted, deflective and lacked true accountability.
“He knew my story, he knew my past, he knew my pain and he chose to exploit it anyway,” Williams said.
In the days leading up to the vote, there was talk that some GOP lawmakers would push for expulsion. But Republican leadership quietly worked behind the scenes to tamp that down.
Expulsion is rare in Missouri’s legislature, reserved for extraordinary circumstances, such as after the Civil War for disloyalty to the Union and, in 2021, for credible allegations of sexual and physical abuse of children.
Concerns about escalation also played a role. Push for expulsion, and Democrats might start scrolling through their phones and sharing messages they’ve received from GOP lawmakers.
The logic of mutually assured destruction, it seems, was enough to end any serious talk of expulsion.

Children’s Division, the section of the state’s social services department responsible for foster care and investigating child abuse and neglect, has also had seven directors since 2018 — and during that time faced intense scrutiny from state lawmakers for failing to report missing foster children and boarding foster children in hospitals because there was nowhere else for them to go.
As Gov. Mike Kehoe proposes cutting $600 million in general revenue expenditures to address a dwindling surplus and declining revenues, the Missouri Department of Social Services is not seeking funding for additional Children’s Division staff from state lawmakers.
“Our current focus is maximizing the resources we have — ensuring team members are supported, cases are managed effectively and staff have the tools they need to perform their jobs well,” said department spokesperson Baylee Watts in an email to The Independent.
The department requested, and Kehoe recommended, the same number of full time equivalent positions for division field staff in fiscal year 2027 as it received for the current fiscal year.
Meanwhile, state lawmakers have filed an array of bills designed to address what they say are lingering problems in the division. While the sponsors of those bills hesitated to recommend additional spending, other lawmakers and advocates cautioned against imposing standards that the division might not be able to meet without more frontline workers.
 Staffing challenges

Former caseworkers who spoke with The Independent in 2022 reported having up to 80 active cases — a workload that contributed to their decisions to leave the division. One former caseworker described the job as “impossible” and said that during the three years she spent training new caseworkers, most quit within four months.
Democratic State Rep. Keri Ingle of Lee’s Summit, a former Children’s Division investigator, said “there is nothing more stressful” than carrying the responsibility of a child’s safety and wondering if you missed something important when visiting a child’s home.
Investigators are required to make contact with a child within 24 hours of a hotline report of possible abuse or neglect.
“You’ll wake up at one o’clock in the morning and think, ‘I should have looked in that room’…or, ‘I’ve got to go make a phone call,’ or ‘I’ve got to go run out at seven o’clock in the morning and try to find this other kid,” Ingle said.
Staff turnover rates have improved in both the division and the wider department, though frontline staff continue to be the most likely to leave. 
Throughout the department, turnover stood at 30% at the end of fiscal year 2025, Watts said in an email to The Independent. The turnover rate in September 2022 was 35%.
‘This job is impossible’: High turnover, low morale plague Missouri child welfare agency

 
Turnover among frontline division staff, which include investigators, foster care case managers and hotline workers, was 40% at the end of fiscal year 2025. That’s down from 55% in September 2022. But it still means over a third of frontline staff working in the division at the beginning of the last fiscal year were gone a year later. 
Lawmakers last year approved a 1% pay increase for Children’s Division workers, on top of Kehoe’s plan giving state workers a 1% pay raise for every two years of service. 
Watts said the department is using savings from past vacancies in the division to establish specialized investigator positions with higher salaries. Watts said the positions “help reduce overall workload for frontline team members while offering additional support on challenging cases.”
There were 79 vacancies across the division as of the end of November, Watts said.
But entry-level salaries for frontline workers are still low. The starting salary for an associate social services specialist in the division is $44,630 and $48,509 for a social services specialist, Watts said.
 Proposed solutions

Some lawmakers don’t think these efforts are enough.
Republican state Rep. Ann Kelley of Lamar said that throughout her tenure on the House Children and Families Committee, she’s found it’s not uncommon for division workers to have 30 to 40 open cases. 
“That is just insane,” Kelley said in an interview with The Independent. “They can’t handle that. You cannot give the amount of care, the [necessary] amount of time to a child when you have that many cases.”
A bill filed by Kelley would limit division case workers to 20 active cases at a time.
Current caseload data was not immediately available from the department. But quarterly reports from the department show that the division is falling short of some of its own standards of service to kids and parents in the child welfare system.
Division policy requires that parents have at least one visit per month with their child in the division’s care, unless a court prohibits meetings. An evaluation team established after the passage of a 2020 state law on foster care set a goal of each county complying with this policy 60% of the time. Between April and June 2025, no more than 6% of counties met this goal, according to an October 2025 report.
The division also struggled to meet policies of one meeting per month between caseworkers and each of a child’s parents. Between July and September 2025, no more than 38% of counties met a goal of adhering to this policy 50% of the time, according to a January report.
Kelley said that addressing high caseloads would require the division to hire more staff.
“They’re going to have to hire more people,” Kelley said. “That’s just what they’re going to have to do.”
Kelley said that although lawmakers and the state’s social services department should explore options that would not require additional appropriations, lowering caseloads would likely mean setting aside money for additional hires.
“Yes, it’s going to be an issue,” Kelley said of the need for additional funding. “But for so long, we have passed it down, passed the buck, and nothing has changed. And so we’ve got to put money where our mouth is because everybody admits that there is a problem.”
Ingle said that while she agrees that there should be a caseload cap for caseworkers, lawmakers must also provide the division with resources to make that cap feasible.
“What do we do after the cap is met?” Ingle said. “That doesn’t [allow us to say], ‘We’re not going to put any more kids in foster care,’ or ‘We’re not going to do any more investigations.’ It just doesn’t work like that.”
Missouri child welfare agency reports increased efforts to find missing foster kids

Jessica Seitz, executive director of the Missouri Network Against Child Abuse, said that while her organization supports accountability for the division around caseloads, 20 cases is an “unrealistic expectation.”
Rather than putting a specific number in statute, Seitz suggested a requirement that the division adhere to national accreditation standards set by the Child Welfare League of America and report to the legislature annually on its ability to meet those standards.
State Rep. Holly Jones, a Eureka Republican who chairs the House Children and Families Committee, said that lawmakers “really need to look at our case managers and the workload that is put on them.”
Jones is sponsoring a bill that would require courts to order additional parenting time to make up for time a parent lost with their child due to an unsubstantiated child abuse or neglect investigation.
Kelley is also sponsoring bills that would require caseworker training for youth aging out of the foster care system and mandate guardians ad litem to talk with children they represent before important hearings to determine custody, visitation rights or support. 
Under a bill sponsored by Republican state Rep. Melissa Schmidt of Eldridge, the division would have to ensure that a child taken into its custody receives a physical examination within 72 hours rather than 30 days.
Between July and September 2025, the division met the current standard of 30 days in no more than 42% of Missouri counties, according to a January report.
Ingle emphasized the importance of adequate funding and staff to equip the division to provide quality services.
“I have not heard of any concerns specifically related to policy that wouldn’t be addressed by addressing pay and [staffing levels],” she said.
And Ingle said that if Missouri lawmakers truly value child welfare and the work of division staff, state spending should reflect that. 
“If we say we care about it, then we should fund it like we care about it, and we should support them like we care about it.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041623_swillum1-scaled-e1717605040418-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-26 06:57:06.815397

Critics say changes could ripple outward — delaying bills, legal mail, prescriptions and mail-in ballots

The U.S. Postal Service in Vermont has quietly implemented changes to the way mail is processed that are expected to further slow down the delivery speed of many mail categories for Vermonters. 
Vermont is the latest region to join Regional Transportation Optimization, a new strategy that ends evening collection of mail that’s more than 50 miles away from regional mail centers. 
Last week, a postal service spokesperson did not answer questions about when the new program was expected to come to Vermont. But on Jan. 16, the postal service filed data in response to questions from the U.S. Postal Regulatory Commission that shows the program has already been implemented in every zip code in the state.

Regional Transportation Optimization is one part of the Delivering for America plan, a years-long strategy of service cuts and other changes that began in 2021 under former Postmaster Louis DeJoy. 
The postal service has said the plan is essential for making its operations efficient and financially self-sustaining. But critics of the program say there’s been a lack of transparency in how the plan could affect the speed and quality of service throughout the country. 
Steve Hutkins, an advocate who runs the Save the Post Office website, said there have been no signs at post offices or other notices to customers letting them know that their mail will be sitting at the back of the post office overnight. 
“The Postal Service doesn’t want the public to pay any attention to this change in its transportation policies and the slower service standards (delivery times) that the change is causing,” Hutkins said via email. 
Postmarks now could be applied to mail a day later than customers expected — meaning that a bill payment could be considered past due, or even a mail-in ballot could be disqualified, Hutkins said. 
How does Regional Transportation Optimization work?
The closest regional processing center for Vermont isn’t in Vermont. It’s in Springfield, Massachusetts, more than 40 miles from the state border, Hutkins said. 
Previously, the postal service would send postal trucks to post offices twice per day – once in the morning, the other in the evening – to pick up mail and bring it to Springfield, Amy Gibbs, a strategic communications specialist for USPS, said via email. The new plan eliminates that second pickup, meaning that any mail that arrives at the post office after the morning pickup will stay at the post office until the following day. 
The postal service has published a map revealing the effect of this change, Hutkins said. For first-class mail, USPS has shifted many parts of Vermont from a two-day service standard to a three-day service standard, and it can take up to five days to reach other parts of the country. 
There are some exceptions, Hutkins said. Local mail in places close to Vermont’s two Local Processing Centers, located in Burlington and White River Junction, could still go to those facilities and be processed more quickly than mail going to Springfield. The postal service proposed closing the two local centers in 2024, but abandoned the plan after political pushback. 
The one-day additional delays in local deliveries come as USPS is also redefining the postmark. On December 24, 2025, the postal service changed its rules to clarify that the postmark does not “inherently or necessarily align with the date” that the piece of mail came to the postal service. 
One key concern for opponents is how both these changes could combine to affect mail-in ballots, since election officials often rely on postmarks to determine whether a ballot was received on Election Day. On January 15, 16 U.S. senators sent a letter to USPS expressing fear that this change could mean more mail-in ballots being rejected. 
In an email, USPS spokesperson Gibbs said the new postmark system does not “signal a change in postmarking procedures,” but only tries to “improve public understanding of the information postmarks convey.” 
Hutkins, a retired New York University professor, began Save the Post Office in 2011 when he learned his local post office was threatened with closure. 
How would he describe the last 15 years for the post office? 
“It’s been: Things get worse slowly, you adjust to it as things go by, and it all gets slower than it used to be,” he said. 
Much of that slowdown has been pinned to former U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. When DeJoy resigned in February 2025, U.S. Senator Peter Welch issued a statement that said “Good riddance.” 
“DeJoy’s restructuring plan has led to unacceptable mail delivery delays across Vermont, especially in rural areas of the state,” Welch said in the statement. 
Yet it remains to be seen what next steps the newly appointed Postmaster General David Steiner will take, Hutkins said. Before his appointment, Steiner served on the board of FedEx, one of USPS’ top competitors, for over a decade. 
Have these changes had an effect on on-time performance? The postal service’s own dashboard shows hardly any change to the percent of first-class mail, the cheapest category of mail for letters, postcards and envelopes, that has arrived within service standards in the Vermont-New Hampshire-Maine region. But Hutkins noted that the standards themselves have changed, making it hard to draw conclusions from the limited data available. 
For some Vermont communities, staffing levels at the post office appears to be a key reason for delays. Montpelier residents have complained about delayed mail and packages in recent weeks when four postal routes were left vacant by a staffing shortage. 
Hutkins said that the overall level of postal workers hasn’t changed much over the years, but retaining part-time workers has been a longstanding challenge. He cited a 2016 USPS report that found the annual turnover rate for non-career employees was over 40%. 
“It’s a really hard job,” he said.
Elizabeth Newman of Hinesburg said that her mail delivery has improved since 2023 and 2024, when she was only getting mail just once a week. But even now, a single mail carrier getting sick seems to lead to all the mail in town coming to a halt. 
She said she’s one of many people in town who have switched to paying her bills online whenever she can. 
“Regularly, we were having to call our credit card companies, and they hadn’t received stuff or it was delayed,” she said. 
Regarding the potential effects of the regional transport and postmark plan, she said it was hard for the average customer to understand because the postal service was like a “black box” of information. 
“You can never find out what happened or why,” she said.

Student-athletes, who are occasionally excused from physical education requirements, would not be exempt from the required 60 minutes of daily activity under the bill.
Legislators expressed concerns over the bill’s logistics — an additional hour of required learning could disrupt or extend the current school schedule. Davidson told a House committee Wednesday that he does not intend for the bill to add more time to the school day or detract from other Common Core curriculum requirements.
Haley Edwards, a senior at Republic High School in Greene County, testified in favor of the bill.
“We see the signs that tie (exercise) back to physical well-being and mental well-being, and I think that this bill really opens doors to be able to see those effects,” Edwards said.
The National Education Association has not yet determined whether legislative action is necessary to enact the proposed requirement, but a spokesman said the organization believes that increased physical activity would benefit students.
Otto Fajan, who testified on behalf of the NEA, said that the role of physical education has shrunk over the past century in American public schools.
“There’s a flow against (P.E.) caused by the structure of accountability,” Fagen said, “and standardized testing in areas that do not include physical literacy.”

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/ Special to The Dailey Gazette)COLUMBIA — A Richland County legislator running for governor will give the Democratic response to Gov. Henry McMaster’s final State of the State address.
Rep. Jermaine Johnson was chosen by the state House Democratic Caucus to deliver the message for his party, his campaign announced in a release Monday morning.
McMaster is scheduled to give his ninth and last State of the State before a joint assembly of the Legislature in House chambers at 7 p.m. Wednesday.
The state’s longest-serving elected governor will lay out his priorities for the 2026 legislative session that started two weeks ago. He’ll also highlight what he considers his administration’s successes for South Carolina and point to initiatives he wants legislators to continue after he leaves office. The Republican governor first ascended to the job in January 2017 when then-Gov. Nikki Haley left to join President Donald Trump’s first administration.

Johnson is among two Democrats who have announced bids to replace McMaster. Charleston attorney Mullins McLeod is also running.
Regardless of the outcome of the governor’s race, Johnson isn’t returning to the Legislature next year. South Carolina law allows candidates to seek more than one office at a time. They just can’t occupy more than one if they win.
But Johnson announced earlier this month that he’s not seeking a fourth term to the House so he can focus on his bid for governor.
It won’t be the first time a Democratic gubernatorial candidate was chosen to lay out Democrats’ vision in an election year.
In 2018, then-state Rep. James Smith of Columbia gave the Democratic response to McMaster’s first State of the State address. McMaster defeated Smith by 8 percentage points that November to win his first elected term as governor. In South Carolina, governors are limited to two elected terms.
SCETV will broadcast the roughly one-hour event, which can be viewed live on its website. The Democratic response, which is pre-recorded, will immediately follow the speech. SCETV will also interview legislators who line up afterward to give their opinions.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mcmaster-takes-mic-1024x598.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

But just how much is difficult to know. 
An internal budget document suggests that the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare doesn’t know if the governor’s proposed $22 million cuts would create “new potential costs.” And those cuts could also result in the state losing over $100 million dollars in federal matching funds that Idaho Medicaid would get. 
But on Thursday, Idaho’s top Medicaid official made it clear: The state’s public assistance program doesn’t have capacity to project how much cuts could spur new costs — unless it is directed to.

“But I also don’t want to imply that more staff would solve the problem,” Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Sasha O’Connell told the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC. “Because I think that it’s also just an issue of not being able to predict some of these changes.”
Forecasting with big changes always carries risk, she added. The state’s estimate for Medicaid’s future budget needs often turn out wrong, she said, in part because the state projects the program’s costs well over a year before the next given fiscal year actually concludes. 
The admission comes while the Idaho Legislature grapples with which Medicaid services to possibly cut, as lawmakers brace for spending reductions after years of tax cuts. 
But some ripple effects of Medicaid cuts are already baked into the governor’s budget proposal. That’s because for every dollar in general funds Idaho pays for Medicaid, the federal government chips in at least twice as much.

 If Idaho cuts state Medicaid funding, it could lose federal funds

If Idaho cuts its spending on Medicaid, that means the state could forgo an even higher amount of federal matching dollars.

Next fiscal year, Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s proposed $45 million in Medicaid cuts would leave the state with nearly $106.8 million less federal funds, according to the Legislative Budget Book, which is produced by Legislative Services’ Office. His Medicaid plan for next year would extend cuts to doctor pay rates, and potentially cut other services like dental coverage and disability services. 
This year, Little’s cuts to doctor pay rates – set to save the state $17.2 million — would leave the state with $44.2 less federal funding. 
In 2023, the Department of Health and Welfare estimated repealing Medicaid expansion – a proposal some in GOP legislative leadership said they would consider this year – would cost the state $78 million more. 
Before the legislative session, Little cautioned that repealing expansion would spark unintended consequences. 
He also said the Department of Health and Welfare was working to figure out the true cost of repeal. It isn’t immediately clear when or if that analysis will be done. 
But in JFAC, O’Connell, the Idaho Medicaid director, highlighted a few costs the state could face if it repealed Medicaid expansion: 

Losing $38 million in revenue from a tax on hospitals, because the rate hospitals pay is based on how many Medicaid enrollees they serve. 
Driving up costs by around $20 million for state hospitals, where some services would shift from being largely federally funded back to state funded. (The federal government pays 90% of costs of Medicaid expansion.)




 Health and Welfare exempted several services from provider reimbursement rate cuts

According to the Legislative Budget Book, the Department of Health and Welfare, following a federally required review, exempted the following services from reimbursement rate cuts:

Home and community-based services, which includes certified family homes and personal care services
School-based services
Tribal providers
Federally Qualified Health Centers’ and Rural Health Centers’ final encounter rate payments
Services funded by the Idaho Home Choice grant
State-owned facilities
Hospice
And pharmacy ingredient cost




 Patients, providers turn out to oppose cuts

As lawmakers mulled the Department of Health and Welfare’s budget Thursday, advocates visited the Capitol to try to protect Medicaid services. 
Julie McConnel, a mom to 10-year old twin boys with Down syndrome, came from Nampa. She said her sons rely on a range of Medicaid services that have improved their lives – including home and community-based services, which is on Little’s list of Medicaid cut options.
Some specialists her sons see have a long wait list, and she worries that cutting their pay rates would make it even harder to get in.
“Where they are now in life is so much due to the early interventions they received for Medicaid — whether it’s general medical expenses or home and community based-services,” she said in an interview outside JFAC’s meeting room. 
Records detail Idaho Medicaid services that could be cut, but not ‘potential new costs’

Sara Bergsma owns a speech therapy clinic in Meridian called We are Better Together. She said providers are still figuring out how to navigate the state’s recent cap of speech therapy at 20 visits a year, which requires prior authorization for any more visits. 
But what worries her more is the prospect of the service being entirely cut — since it was on Little’s list for Medicaid cut options. 
“I don’t know how these clinics will stay open,” Bergsma said in an interview. “They won’t be able to take Medicaid, or they will have to close their doors if that’s the only source of income or the majority of their source of income.”
 Lawmakers mull where to cut Idaho Medicaid

In JFAC, Sen. Carl Bjerke, a Republican from Coeur d’Alene, said he’s received up to 1,000 emails from the public about Medicaid cuts. And he talked about how he was wrangling with how to cut more.
He said he wants money in Medicaid to go to “the people who are the most vulnerable.”

“I can give you many reasons why adult dental is good,” Bjerke said.
But, he said, “if I had to make a decision right here, as we’re making decisions on budgets, whether I’m going to support adult dental or taking care of a single mom taking care of a … severely autistic child, I’m going to weigh on the severely autistic child.”
Sen. Melissa Wintrow, a Boise Democrat, advocated for hearing public testimony from people affected by cuts. 
And she said lawmakers shouldn’t even be in this position.
“We’ve cut revenue too hard. And I would rather look for ways we can put revenue back, so we don’t have to make decisions on these kinds of things – like who deserves it and who doesn’t,” she said. “We’re really picking winners and losers here. And it doesn’t feel good.”
Rep. Chris Bruce, a Republican from Kuna, told lawmakers that they may not be hearing from some taxpayers.
“I’d also like to remind everyone of folks who maybe are working multiple jobs, who do not have insurance for themselves, who are just paying their taxes,” he said. “We need to remember those people who are making these decisions, and not just focus on the calls that we get all the time.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative proposal could be one of the last hurdles facing an $800 million deal meant to leave the University of Nebraska the sole owner of Nebraska Medicine, and the bill appears to be gaining traction after a restructuring late last week of the nonprofit’s board.
Legislative Bill 1125, from State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, would require legislative approval before NU could acquire a controlling or sole interest in any hospital or health care facility valued at more than $100 million. That could include the planned deal for NU to assume sole ownership of Nebraska Medicine from its longtime partner, Clarkson Regional Health Services, which wants out.
“I think we need some review, and we’re not trying to do or undo the transaction,” Sorrentino told the Nebraska Examiner.

The bill has gotten more attention after NU and Clarkson announced Thursday that they were immediately changing the Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors, kicking off nearly all members and appointing a few new voting members from NU and Clarkson who are explicitly friendly to the ownership change.
“They took what I consider a nuclear action and blew the whole deal up,” State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area said Friday.
Of Sorrentino’s bill, von Gillern said: “It is far more interesting today than it was yesterday.”
‘Incredibly short-sighted’
Von Gillern said he was “really disappointed” in the Thursday board shakeup. He had led more than 30 of his colleagues to ask Jan. 8 that regents take more time to review before voting. The vote was delayed one week, to Jan. 15, partly because of lawmakers’ recommendations.

On Jan. 14, NU and the former Nebraska Medicine board, which organized opposition to the deal, also made separate in-person last stands to lawmakers. Clarkson joined NU at its forum.
Among the pleas was one from the then-Nebraska Medicine board chair, Lance Fritz, for lawmakers to consider stepping in, an action NU says is unnecessary.
Von Gillern said the competing forums were meant to encourage a “deeper level” of conversation and engagement between the organizations. And while he says he has “no reason to doubt NU’s or Clarkson’s authority to change the board, he still worries about the fallout.
“I think it was incredibly short-sighted, from a corporate-citizenship standpoint, from recognizing the level of engagement by the civic community in Omaha and philanthropy,” von Gillern said.
‘Nobody likes surprises’
The NU Board of Regents, at its Jan. 15 meeting, unanimously authorized the transaction. Regents anticipate it will “close” by June 30, barring any other changes or roadblocks. NU agreed to pay Clarkson $500 million for its 50% share of Nebraska Medicine and $300 million for related properties.
In return, Clarkson would donate $200 million back to NU for “Project Health,” a $2.19 billion endeavor to build up the next generation of health care.
Less than 24 hours after the unanimous vote, the Nebraska Medicine board, under its previous leadership, filed a lawsuit in Douglas County to try to stop the deal. The suit argues that the parent organizations had not followed the law and left the former Nebraska Medicine board members out of necessary negotiations, including exploring possible alternatives.
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a former hospital administrator, said he was skeptical Clarkson would leave Nebraska. He pointed to Fritz’s leadership, a former CEO and president of Union Pacific, as one reason why philanthropy in Omaha could be energized to step in. 
Fritz had told lawmakers at least one philanthropist in Omaha might be interested.

Riepe said for the size of the NU-Clarkson deal, it needed a lot more communication, “maybe even up to the point of a year that says, ‘This is what’s being considered.’” The proposal was announced Jan. 2. Nondisclosure agreements went back to July 2024.
“Nobody likes surprises, and I think this was a surprise,” Riepe said of the deal. “A big surprise.”
Part of the reason for the quick action was concern about whether Clarkson might try to sell to an out-of-state or for-profit corporation. The university’s exclusive window for negotiations would have ended after Jan. 15, regents said.
As a fail safe, Sorrentino’s bill would also prohibit any hospital or academic health center that serves as the primary affiliate of UNMC — in this case, Clarkson — from selling all or part of its share to an out-of-state or for-profit entity, unless the state attorney general, in consultation with the NU Board of Regents, determines such changes are “in the public interest.”
Riepe said that in his experience, projects that don’t start well often don’t end well. He hopes that isn’t the case for the Nebraska Medicine changes.
Nonprofit board shakeup
NU and Clarkson on Thursday said the board restructuring came after “careful review” and as the owners had “serious concerns about recent actions and behavior” by board members. The two organizations also described the legal action as “extraordinary.”

The board restructuring could end the lawsuit, as the board’s now-four voting members include NU President Dr. Jeffrey Gold, interim University of Nebraska Medical Center Chancellor Dr. Dele Davies and Clarkson CEO Dr. Bill Lydiatt. All three have explicitly endorsed the transaction.
Those NU and Clarkson leaders are now, in effect, suing themselves. As of Friday afternoon, no additional legal motions had been filed in Douglas County District Court.
Should lawmakers get involved?
While von Gillern and Sorrentino want to have a deeper conversation, not all lawmakers are convinced the Legislature should get involved.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, now in her 12th year as a state legislator, said she had been monitoring statements from NU, the former Nebraska Medicine board and Clarkson. She said that “like most challenging issues in public life,” each had good points.
“But I think, at the end of the day, where I am, is that I just don’t see a legislative issue or role in regards to resolution of this matter for a variety of different reasons,” Conrad said.
State Sens. Merv Riepe of Ralston and Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. April 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
She and Riepe both pointed to a 1977 Nebraska Supreme Court case, named after former Gov. Jim Exon, in which the high court limited how much political influence the Legislature can exert over NU because the Nebraska Constitution gives that general governing power to the NU Board of Regents.
Said Riepe: “I don’t think that we need to put in another level of discussions that take a lot more time and a lot more fuss and everything else.”
In a statement to the Examiner, the regents said their action to acquire Clarkson’s share of Nebraska Medicine “is well within the bounds of the long-established constitutional powers” of the regents and that the board acted in “good faith” at the “opportunity” that Clarkson offered.
“We will continue to move forward in the best interest of the university, Nebraska Medicine and the students, patients and Nebraskans we serve,” the regents’ statement reads. “We believe this is best achieved without legislation.”
A Clarkson spokesperson said their organization was still reviewing Sorrentino’s bill. Nebraska Medicine declined to comment Friday.
‘Cooler heads could prevail’
Sorrentino’s bill has been sent to the Legislature’s Executive Board, chaired by State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. Hansen said Thursday’s shakeup “set a few hairs on fire” and that while lawmakers might have wanted to wait, Sorrentino’s bill might come for a hearing sooner.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair. April 17, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Hansen said lawmakers planned to take a “breath” over the weekend and decide on scheduling soon.
While the transaction heads to “closing,” Sorrentino said he still thinks his bill could have an impact. He said the Legislature “probably owes taxpayers at least a review,” noting the price tag of the deal mirrors what state legislators have appropriated in baseline state tax dollars to NU.
“I wished that cooler heads could prevail and we could discuss this,” Sorrentino said Friday.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Alligators could be raised as pets and for food under an Oklahoma bill pending before lawmakers.
Senate Bill 2087, by Sen. Jonathan Wingard, R-Ada,  would allow the raising of alligators hatched from eggs in captivity without a permit.
Currently, a permit and written permission from the director of the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation are required to own an alligator, said Wade Farrar, assistant chief of law enforcement for the agency. 
Most permits issued are for alligators in zoos, he said.
He did not have numbers of how many licenses had been issued.
The state Department of Wildlife said alligators mate around June each year, and lay 20 to 30 eggs. The Oklahoma City Zoo reports that American alligators live an average of 35 to 50 years and are naturally found in Southeastern Oklahoma.
“What I’m looking at and working on is there has been some interest expressed in the food production side of this, allowing meat processing plants to raise alligators to be able to have for slaughter,” Wingard said.
He said the measure was a constituent request, and he is trying to determine if there is a market in Oklahoma for alligator meat. Alligator skin could also be sold, he said.
He said the bill he wrote is incomplete, but he needed to get something filed as a placeholder before the bill filing deadline.
The way the measure is currently written, it would allow for individuals to raise alligators as pets as long as the animal wasn’t taken from the wild, he said.
He said the measure has generated some controversy.
“At this time, it is an incomplete bill with incomplete language, so if it does move forward, there will be more put in as guardrails and protections and it would be narrowed up before it ever would even be considered,” Wingard said.
The measure directs the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation to create rules to implement it.

As they crossed the Fox River, marchers formed a line longer than the Ray Nitschke Memorial Bridge, which crosses the Fox River. 
“The only people who can defend us is us,” Daniel Castillo, a member of the Green Bay Anti-War Committee, told the crowd.

After he was shot by federal agents, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said Pretti, who was carrying a registered handgun when six Border Patrol agents tackled him, but did unholster it, appeared eager to inflict “maximum damage” on assembled federal agents. Videos taken at the scene, showing Pretti holding a cellphone camera, not a gun, and trying to help a woman who was knocked to the ground by agents, as well as  what’s known about Pretti’s background, belie the Trump administration’s claims, the Minnesota Reformer reported.
In a statement, Pretti’s parents said they are “heartbroken but also very angry” and requested, “Please get the truth out about our son.” They said that “the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting.”
“Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital,” the parents’ statement said in part. “Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact. I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman.”
Lori Blakeslee, communications director for the Green Bay Area Public School District, confirmed to the Wisconsin Examiner that Pretti graduated from Green Bay Preble High School in 2006.

In an interview early Sunday afternoon, Travis Vanden Heuvel told the Examiner he and Pretti were in a choir program together, and that the two were friends during elementary and middle school. 
“I think he was standing up for what was right and just, and I’m saddened and angered by what happened and how it happened,” Vanden Heuvel said. 
Vanden Heuvel said when he learned about the shooting, not knowing who the victim was, the word he had been using to describe it was tragic. His old assistant choir director had reached out to let him know Pretti had been killed. 
“And tragic became devastating, not that this happening in America or in Minnesota didn’t already make it close to home,” Vanden Heuvel said. “I mean, I think we’ve been feeling it hit closer and closer to home.”
The Examiner previously reported on a march against ICE in downtown Green Bay almost a year ago, in the weeks that followed President Donald Trump’s inauguration. 
Castillo told the Examiner this is different from last year’s event.
“It was just the random activist that approached us and said, ‘Would you like to set up some sort of event that shows that immigrants are just people too?’” Castillo said. “…This is much different, and because people are angry… they’re just mad that a man was assassinated, extra-judicially murdered.” 
Jennifer Gonzalez, communications coordinator for the Green Bay Police Department, said that “today’s demonstration, like others held in our community, was calm and peaceful, with no significant incidents.”
Protests also occurred elsewhere in Wisconsin, including in Milwaukee, Madison, Oshkosh and Superior.
State Rep. Amaad Rivera-Wagner (D-Green Bay) said in a statement that “it is not surprising that Alex was a nurse with roots in Green Bay, a place where we believe in taking care of each other and respecting human dignity.”
“We must come together to demand accountability, because hate cannot win,” Rivera-Wagner said. 
In a statement Saturday, Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich said “another American citizen is dead as the result of the federal government’s occupation of an American city, and the victim, Alex Pretti, was a graduate of a Green Bay high school.” 
“Without knowing all the facts of the case, we can say with certainty that a full, transparent, and independent investigation must be conducted,” Genrich said. “I mourn his tragic death with his friends and family, and join the chorus of Americans who are rightfully demanding the federal government change course and enforce immigration law in keeping with local, state and federal laws and the U.S. Constitution.”

(Getty Images)If I was in need of an emergency transfusion, the last thing I would be thinking about is whether the person who donated their life-saving blood had received the COVID-19 vaccine.
In fact, I’d just be thankful that someone had stepped up to donate healthy blood.
But I guess that’s one big difference between me and Republican state Rep. Justin Humphrey, who for whatever reason fears receiving blood from donors who got  their COVID shot will do him grievous bodily harm.
Humphrey wasted state resources filing legislation that would require the State Department of Health to squander money getting into the business of running a blood bank. And not just any blood bank, but one that only stores blood that is “untainted” by the vaccine to fight COVID-19.
It’s so absurd, I wanted to laugh when I first saw the bill, figuring it was just more theatrics orchestrated to grab headlines. It is, of course, from the same lawmaker who once garnered international attention with his proposal to create a bigfoot hunting license, and who now has his sights set on the lieutenant governor’s office.
A day after Oklahoma Voice first reported on the measure and he faced a deluge of ridicule — mixed with some adoration — on social media, I ran into Humphrey in the Capitol. Humphrey told me he no longer planned to pursue this plan legislatively. He had not ruled out working to develop a national blood bank like it through private avenues because he believes there is interest in this. He said it prompted a needed conversation.
The lawmaker from Lane said he had spoken with the head of Our Blood Institute, the nation’s sixth largest independent blood center, which is headquartered in Oklahoma City. He said he’ll use his bill to promote blood donation and to spread the word that Oklahomans can donate their own blood ahead of time to be used in planned procedures that require transfusions.
That seems like a fitting end to this tale.
Even with this particular bill out of the way, though, it’s emblematic of a larger problem. Proposals like this continue to symbolize the increasingly vocal segment of our Legislature that are either against science and medicine, have no grasp on how things actually work in health care or are hoping to capitalize off people’s ignorance.
In recent years, we’ve seen Oklahoma lawmakers spend inordinate amounts of time fearmongering about modern medicine, and we’ve seen them give credence to a small but influential anti-vaccine movement through a variety of legislative proposals.
I fear this year – an election year – is going to be infinitely worse as politicians jockey for attention and votes.
I sure hope I’m wrong.
But last session, we had a state senator accuse women of murdering babies if they take birth control, and he railed against the dangers of that safe medicine..
In June, lawmakers cheered happily for Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt when he said he would pen an executive order that forbade the state Health Department from recommending fluoride in public water supplies.
Now, we’ve also got at least one lawmaker who wants to divert Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust money that voters have specifically earmarked to improve public health to pay higher education costs for the children of teachers. 
I fail to see how that will help improve health outcomes in states, like ours, which ranks in the bottom five in access, quality and public health and has an above average rates of obesity and people without health insurance.
As someone who believes wholeheartedly in modern medicine and public health, it’s absolutely exhausting to watch these legislative shenanigans play out year after year. 
Alarmingly, it’s getting more  difficult to tell who’s joking, pandering to a base or who legitimately believes what they’re spouting while they file bills. And, it’s hard to tell which bills will die a quick legislative death and which will suddenly get reworked late in the session and charge through the opaque lawmaking process.
Unfortunately, that distracts from the good work other legislators are trying to do. It also pulls medical professionals, who are already in short supply, away from their patients as they’re forced to spend inordinate amounts of their precious time having to rebut false claims to make sure we’re all safer.
Take Humphrey’s COVID bill, for example.
Medical professionals say there is no way to differentiate between the antibodies of people who have had COVID and those who have had the vaccine. And the vaccine is safe.
Mercy Hospital Oklahoma City’s chief medical officer said they don’t routinely have patients demanding special blood.
Please believe them. 
Humphrey could have figured that out himself before filing this legislation.
At this point, pretty much everyone has probably had COVID, even if they don’t know it, since for most people it appears like a respiratory virus.
So to make Humphrey’s vision a reality, he’d need to either find people living off the grid, or he’ll need to take copious amounts of blood from newborn babies, which isn’t safe or humane.
The Legislature would be an infinitely better place if lawmakers actually trusted our health care providers and talked to them — not at them — when crafting legislation.
Hopefully moving forward, they’ll do that.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist only entered the race for Secretary of State two weeks ago. In that time, key Democrats have been rallying around him, showing off the type of organizing and bridge-building strength he’ll certainly need to get over the edge with delegates at the party’s spring endorsement convention.
Gilchrist left the gubernatorial race on Jan. 12, citing his intention to play a bigger role against threats from President Donald Trump and federal officials to meddle in upcoming elections, and broader threats to democracy that have faced the state and nation.
That said, Gilchrist was running second fiddle to current Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who remains the frontrunner in the governor’s race and now only faces Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the upcoming August primary.
Gilchrist’s entrance into the Democratic secretary of state contest, which is heavily influenced  by the state’s powerful unions and interest groups at the party’s spring and summer conventions, immediately pushed another candidate, Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, out of the race. Edevbie has since endorsed Gilchrist.
The race is now between Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, former state Sen. Adam Hollier of Detroit, and former Michigan State Lottery Commissioner Suzanna Shkreli.
On Thursday, Gilchrist unloaded a fresh round of endorsements that included more than 40 public officials, congressional districts and union groups.

— Garlin Gilchrist (@garlin) January 22, 2026

Adrian Hemond, CEO of the Grassroots Midwest consulting firm, told Michigan Advance on Friday that Gilchrist has had a pretty impressive showing right out of the gate.
“Obviously, this is a way different sort of race than a statewide primary election, because the electorate is just whoever shows up at convention and has voting rights,” Hemond said. “But endorsements matter much more in this race than they do in a statewide primary. … They matter a lot at convention because a lot of organizations that can endorse have the ability to move their members, and a lot of elected officials who endorse have reach with some of the groups who are going to show on the convention floor.”
Hemond said that Gilchrist’s new round of endorsements also show that his bid for secretary of state is already going better than his year of running for governor thus far, and that’s likely why he made the switch.
Gilchrist building bridges instead of letting them burn
Gilchrist, during his gubernatorial bid, carved out a space for himself as one of the only gubernatorial candidates to decisively support the Palestinian freedom movement and call Israel’s war on Gaza a genocide. He also said he would not accept money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC. The lieutenant governor made that pronouncement last summer at the annual American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee national convention in Dearborn.
That stance and others, like his strong union support and his championing of the state’s Clean Slate expungement program, earned him the endorsement of U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), who has been a leading voice for Palestinian freedom during her time in Congress.
Soon after Gilchrist dropped from the gubernatorial hunt and entered the race for secretary of state, he appeared at a candidate forum hosted by the Michigan Democratic Party’s Jewish Caucus. There, he apologized for how those remarks may have been perceived as antisemitic, although his campaign later clarified that he was not retracting his previous statements on Gaza.

Gilchrist also noted that he met with the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee.
Despite those statements, it appears that Tlaib is still on board with Gilchrist’s campaign for secretary of state, as she is listed among his new supporters list released Thursday. The list also includes Dearborn Mayor Adbullah Hammoud, an unabashed supporter of Palestinian rights and a strong critic of the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Michigan Advance attempted to interview Tlaib for this story prior to Gilchrist’s new slate of endorsements, in hopes to better understand where she stood now with the lieutenant governor now that he was out of the governor’s race and after comments at the party-hosted forum.
Tlaib’s communications office did not respond to numerous text messages or phone calls seeking an interview with the congresswoman.
Hemond said Gilchrist’s maneuvering on Gaza and Israel — admitting where he might have been wrong in some respects with moderate Democrats while still sticking to his guns on a previously stated ideological position that’s important to progressives — speaks to his effectiveness as a politician within the Democratic coalition.
“Ultimately, he’s got to take his case to the general electorate, but winning these convention fights requires a different sort of politics, and he appears to have some aptitude at that,” Hemond said.
What does this momentum mean for those still in the race?
Gilchrist gaining traction so late in the game and at an accelerated rate may be tripping alarm bells for the likes of Byrum, Hollier and Shkreli, the latter of whom also joined the race fairly late into the cycle. 
Hemond expects that at least one or two of the candidates who are not Garlin Gilchrist to leave the race by the time the party holds its early endorsement convention in the spring.

“I think Gilchrist will do well at the convention, whether he wins or not,” Hemond said. “I think it depends, to some extent, on who else is in the race. I don’t expect this to go to a vote between three candidates. It’ll be a vote between two candidates, if it’s not a coronation.”
Hemond expects at least one of them to be Gilchrist, and whoever his opponent is in the final stretch.
If that person is Byrum, his momentum certainly puts pressure on her, but Hemond called Byrum a brand-name candidate due to her family history in politics and ties to organized labor.
It also puts pressure on Hollier if he’s still standing on the eve of the convention, as the party would then have two prominent Black politicians from Detroit running for the same spot, although Hollier has been working to reach out statewide for support.
Shkreli, meanwhile, has also been making the rounds of Democratic constituent groups in her bid to be the party’s nominee.

In the case of Byrum, the former lawmaker and current Ingham clerk has been in the race since last spring, and is potentially the most qualified person in the hunt for the nomination. Deep-bench qualifications, however, don’t necessarily mean an easy or expected path to victory when the nomination is decided by party fixtures and not average voters.
In an interview with the Advance, Byrum said Friday that she remains the candidate with most experience doing the job she’s campaigning for, and with the kind of early endorsements that still matter — several unions and many local clerks.
To that point, Gilchrist, at present, has backing from the powerful Michigan Education Association and Unite Here Local 24.
Byrum, on the other hand, has support from nearly a dozen union locals, including the Greater Lansing Labor Council, Lansing-based UA Local 333 Plumbers & Pipefitters, Detroit’s UA Local 636 Pipefitters, Flint’s UA Local 370 Plumbers & Pipefitters and Monroe’s UA Local 671 Plumbers, Pipefitters, HVAC & Welders.
Byrum said she wasn’t fazed by Gilchrist’s swift albeit late launch.

“I had three opponents last month; I have three opponents today,” Byrum told the Advance. “I am the only qualified candidate in this race for Secretary of State. I’m the only candidate who has run an election, 42 to be exact. I have been, for 13 years, the only one who’s a nationally certified election administrator. … None of my opponents have done anything like that.”
Byrum added that Michigan needs a secretary of state who is “ready and willing on day one to defend the integrity of our elections.”

Recent controversies over sprawling energy development have triggered a slate of bills to empower voters and communities in state-level energy ambitions.
The post Nuclear waste, state land use top Wyoming Legislature’s energy agenda appeared first on WyoFile .","If there’s a theme among energy-related bills proposed for the Legislature’s upcoming budget session, it might be giving the electorate and local communities more say in what many residents regard as a tsunami of energy development proposals.
From a growing crop of wind turbines to mining proposals, prospective nuclear manufacturing and hydrogen energy projects, residents have clashed with one another, county officials and the state. Tensions swirl around the economic, safety and cultural ramifications of a rapidly changing energy landscape.
One bill speaks directly to the sense that, although Wyoming wants to remain the nation’s premier source of raw power, residents want to have more of a say about what’s a good fit.
A public vote on nuclear waste storage?
One of the most high-profile conflicts has centered on nuclear energy and whether the state should loosen its ban on spent nuclear fuel waste storage. 
House Joint Resolution 3, “Storage of spent nuclear fuel and waste-vote required,” aims to put the authority to decide directly in Wyoming voters’ hands. If passed, the general election ballot in November would include a referendum on whether to amend Wyoming’s constitution to proclaim:

“No storage, siting or placement of high-level radioactive waste shall be authorized under state law and occur except upon an affirmative vote of the people of the state.


“No storage, siting or placement of spent nuclear fuel shall be authorized under state law and occur except upon an affirmative vote of the people of the state.


“That the Secretary of State shall endorse the following statement on the proposed amendment: The adoption of this amendment would require an affirmative vote of the people of the state before any high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel can be stored in Wyoming.”

All 13 sponsors behind the resolution are members and allies of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, indicative of a political divide that has already curtailed some nuclear development. In October, Radiant Industries announced it was withdrawing its plans to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility in Natrona County. Radiant’s plan would have required a change to Wyoming’s ban on high-level nuclear waste storage. Though lawmakers have tried several times to do just that, the effort has met passionate opposition, including this past summer.
At stake is whether Wyoming can reap the economic benefits of high-dollar nuclear energy proposals without sacrificing public safety. While the bill’s primary sponsor, Midwest Republican Rep. Bill Allemand, says he believes storage facilities can be operated safely, it’s unlikely that any nuclear waste deemed as “temporarily” stored here would ever be removed from the state, because there are no plans for a federal repository, he noted.
Plus, Allemand said, Radiant’s proposed site was simply too close to homes and schools in Bar Nunn, and elected officials didn’t advocate for what he considered a majority of neighbors who didn’t want to take the risk.
“Their elected officials turned a blind eye and would not listen to them,” Allemand told WyoFile. “They said they might pay a price at the next election. Well, for these people in Bar Nunn, that would have been too late.”

Proponents of bringing nuclear energy projects to Wyoming say the state risks earning a reputation as unwelcoming to the industry, which has plenty of other states courting those dollars.
If such a referendum were to pass, Allemand said, it would not stop ongoing discussions about what aspects of the nuclear energy industry might be a good fit for Wyoming. “But the Legislature, the governor, the county commission — they would no longer have that right,” he said. “It will be the people, and that’s where it should be on something of this high of importance.”
Energy on state lands
Lawmakers will also consider at least two bills that would require more public engagement and allow for more flexibility regarding energy and other industrial developments on state lands.
Senate File 40, “State lands-designation of community-valued land,” would allow the Wyoming Environmental Quality Council to designate state lands, on a case-by-case nomination basis, as “lands with significant community value.” 
Senate File 42, “County zoning authority-amendments,” would specify that counties have the authority to “implement zoning regulations for specified purposes.”
“There needs to be a little bit more of a vetting process to allow for the county commissioners or the city council or communities, in general, to at least weigh in before it lands on the desk in front of the [state lands] board.”Casper Republican Sen. Bill Landon
Both bills, according to proponents, attempt to give communities and local officials more say over state-sanctioned activities on what are known as “school sections” — state-owned lands prioritized for the financial and general benefit of Wyoming public schools. Some critics say the Wyoming State Board of Land Commissioners has pursued those priorities too narrowly, failing to provide proper notice to locals when granting leases and insisting that county zoning and land use rules cannot trump the state’s authority over school sections.
Senate File 40, according to the bill’s sponsor, Casper Republican Sen. Bill Landon, “attempts to give communities an option, or at least give a little bit better vetting process to what we do on state lands, particularly state lands that are either contiguous or close to communities.”
Two years ago, controversy erupted over the state land board’s approval of mining leases on state lands at the base of Casper Mountain, where a gravel mining company proposes to set up operations. Adjacent homeowners cried foul, saying the gravel pit threatens water wells and neighborhood safety. Both homeowners and county officials were irate that the state didn’t reach out to locals before approving the leases.

Beyond Casper Mountain, residents and local officials throughout central and eastern Wyoming have said the state has approved wind and other industrial projects without considering other land values or the cumulative impacts that threaten ranching and small communities.
“There needs to be a little bit more of a vetting process,” Landon said, “to allow for the county commissioners or the city council or communities, in general, to at least weigh in before it lands on the desk in front of the [state lands] board.”
Landon noted that SF 40 doesn’t attempt to supersede the state’s authority over school sections, but prescribes a process for more public engagement and the opportunity to recognize the value of lands, on a case-by-case basis, beyond generating revenue from industrial development.
Senate File 42 flirts with the contentious issue of whether counties can impose zoning and other land use rules that might conflict with state-sanctioned activities on school sections. The measure would give counties more of a say when it comes to supposedly temporary industrial and commercial activities that can be prolonged via state lease extensions, according to co-sponsor Casper Republican Rep. Steve Harshman.

The clash over such county-versus-state authorities has generated several lawsuits in recent years, including a recent court ruling in favor of Prism Logistics, the company that wants to mine gravel at the base of Casper Mountain.
Federal minerals
Though Wyoming officials cheered the GOP-led Big Beautiful Bill, there was some regret over a provision that slashed the federal mineral royalty rate for coal, oil and natural gas — a longtime pillar of revenue to the state. The move, related to coal royalties alone, is estimated to choke the annual flow of federal dollars to Wyoming by $50 million, according to estimates.
To help make up for those losses, House Joint Resolution 2, “Federal mineral royalties-state share,” sponsored by the Legislature’s Select Federal Natural Resource Management Committee, would ask Congress to increase Wyoming’s share of federal mineral royalties from 50% to 87.5%, according to the bill draft.
The committee is also sponsoring Senate Joint Resolution 1, “State management-federal mineral leases.” The resolution would request that Congress amend the federal Mineral Leasing Act to “authorize the state of Wyoming to administer and manage mineral leasing on federal lands located in Wyoming.”
Though the production of federal minerals has been a major source of revenue and job creation in Wyoming, state leaders have bristled at past administrations’ leasing decisions, particularly when the Biden administration imposed a ban on all future federal coal leasing in the Powder River Basin — a move that the Trump administration is reversing.
The resolution claims Wyoming could administer federal leasing in the state more efficiently and at a lower cost. It also asserts that “Authorizing Wyoming to administer and manage mineral leasing of federal minerals not only respects the principles of federalism and local control but also ensures that decisions are made by those who know the land best and are most invested in its long-term sustainability.”

The proposed cuts are a form of negotiation by hostage taking, with the caucus using UW and the business council as leverage in future negotiations, writes Rep. Ken Chestek.
The post The Wyoming Freedom Caucus is playing games with the budget appeared first on WyoFile .","The budget proposal being forced out of the Wyoming Joint Appropriations Committee by its Freedom Caucus members is not a serious one. It is the opening bid in a negotiation, which promises to get very ugly and very contentious when the full Legislature convenes in two weeks. Worst of all, it shows the utter disregard that the Freedom Caucus has for the majority of Wyoming citizens. They are playing a very dangerous game.

Opinion

I teach a unit on negotiations in several of the courses I teach at the University of Wyoming School of Law. I teach my students to identify the “negotiating context” in which they find themselves, then select their negotiating strategies and tactics to match the context. 
One typical context is called a “competitive” context, in which the parties view the situation as purely a zero-sum game: For every dollar I give you, I need something of equal value in return. Competitive tactics include taking extreme opening positions, contesting every fact, making minimal concessions and using threats to belittle the opposing side, hoping to force bigger concessions from your opponent.
Everything about the bill coming out of the JAC reveals that the Freedom Caucus views the budget as a competitive context. The state’s revenue stream is level, and Gov. Mark Gordon proposed a balanced budget. Therefore, the extreme cuts being proposed by the Freedom Caucus are unnecessary; they are just cuts for the sake of cuts. 
We can afford the full funding the governor proposed for the University of Wyoming. We can afford to invest in Wyoming’s future through the Wyoming Business Council. We can afford to fund Wyoming Public Media. 
The proposed cuts or elimination of those programs amount to nothing more than hostage taking; an attempt to gain leverage in future negotiations. What the Freedom Caucus wants in exchange remains to be seen, but you can bet the concessions they want relate to the group’s extreme right-wing agenda.
The problem with all of this is that the Freedom Caucus has shown that it is willing to harm Wyoming citizens to achieve its right-wing goals. Defunding the Wyoming Business Council will make innovation and job creation in Wyoming much more difficult. The huge proposed cut to the University of Wyoming will force the school to end programs and lay off staff, and render our only four-year university less competitive in seeking enrollment. How much clearer a message could the Freedom Caucus send to our young citizens? If we don’t fund job creation and a robust education system, why should a young person stay in Wyoming?
Every concerned Wyoming citizen should contact their state legislators now and tell them in no uncertain terms that they don’t want right-wing politics to harm job creation and higher education.

In this dizzying new era of state terror, citizens and community leaders alike are trying to figure out what to do. What power do we have to face down a violent, repressive government targeting civilians in an operation aimed not at protecting public safety but at disrupting and destroying civil society? 
At a press conference with local media last week, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan promised to fight against a Minneapolis-like surge in Wisconsin, drawing a lot of probing follow-up questions from reporters. Pocan voted against $64 billion in funding for the Department of Homeland Security that passed the House and is now, belatedly, facing difficulties in the Senate. He said he would work with local law enforcement, support lawsuits filed by Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul and other state AGs against aggressive ICE deployments, and encourage peaceful protestors marching in inflatable dinosaur costumes. 
But the question of how to fight back is a tough one.
The federal government has created a massive paramilitary organization that is systematically terrorizing Democratic-led Midwestern cities. The 3,000 immigration agents in Minneapolis far outnumber the local police force there. We have never seen anything quite like this.
Minnesota elected officials seem to be struggling with the question of how to resist and how to defend their citizens. Along with strong language about the damage the federal crackdown is doing to the community, Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz repeatedly admonished protesters to remain peaceful, then deployed the Minnesota National Guard to block people from visiting a memorial at the site of Pretti’s death. Bringing in local and state law enforcement and the Guard to police protesters seems to buttress the Trump administration’s false claims that Minnesotans are the ones causing the violence, and that more armed men policing civilian neighborhoods will increase public safety. In reality, federal agents are the ones who are acting violently, not Minneapolis residents, and it’s not clear that local and state police are doing anything to protect the public from this threat.
The fact is, it’s hard to figure out what to do.
In Madison, on Saturday night more than 100 of my neighbors packed the James Reeb Unitarian Universalist Church for a potluck and discussion of nonviolent action, looking for answers to the terrible questions raised by the shooting death of yet another civilian in Minneapolis. 
How do we prepare for the possibility of an onslaught of armed federal agents into our own communities, busting down doors without warrants, dragging people out of their homes and firing on the neighbors who try to protect them? What power do we have to turn back the transformation of our country from democracy to authoritarian regime? 
The Madison event, planned before Pretti was killed, was organized by a coalition of dozens of peace and social justice groups under the umbrella Building Unity for Nonviolent Action. Speakers, including my friend John Nichols of The Nation magazine and Dane County Judge and Rev. Everett Mitchell, talked about the history of peaceful resistance in the U.S. The group showed part of the documentary “A Force More Powerful” about transformative nonviolent resistance struggles in India, the segregated American South, South Africa, Denmark and Chile. 
It was restorative to gather in person, take a break from isolation, helpless rage and doomscrolling and to spend some time contemplating the heroism of the Civil Rights movement activists who faced down hatred and violence with astounding courage and faith — despite all evidence to the contrary — in the fundamental decency of other people.
The difference between the Civil Rights era and today — and even the difference between the Black Lives Matter movement against police violence of a few years ago and today — is that the federal government can no longer be counted on to enforce civil rights, due process and justice. We are in a new era. “Those protections are gone,” Rev. Mitchell told the crowd. “So the only thing that you have available to you is each other.”
That bracing realization has spurred a proliferation of nonviolent resistance trainings in Minnesota and in other states, including Wisconsin.
One salutary side effect is that peaceful gatherings that bring out our capacity for love, mutual aid and connection help us avoid drowning in anger and despair.
Last weekend we drove to Minneapolis to visit our daughter who is, alarmingly, living in the middle of the chaos there. On our way to take her out for lunch we came upon a massive group of people holding a walking vigil in the neighborhood near where Nicole Good was shot. About 600 Minnesotans were walking the streets singing, “You are not alone” and “Hold on, here comes the dawn,” as immigrant children and their parents peered out the windows of locked houses, waving. It was an unexpected moment of grace. A glimpse of the humanity and caring that are still possible. We need to hold onto that vision.

With the bill filing deadline for the 2026 legislative session looming at the end of the month, the task force plans to draft a bill creating a waste diversion council that would assist Tennessee counties with finding ways to keep recyclable waste out of the state’s quickly-filling landfills and educate consumers about what they can recycle and where.
Tennessee businesses have told lawmakers in previous meetings that they are willing to purchase more recycled aluminum and glass if Tennessee can collect, process and produce sufficient quantities of recycled material to make it worthwhile. Right now, the state’s recycling rate is too low.
This comes as the Tennessee Waste to Jobs Act returns to the legislature for consideration. The act — introduced in 2025 by Sen. Heidi Campbell and Rep. Bob Freeman, both Nashville Democrats — would establish an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) model for packaging in Tennessee.
In EPR models, which have been in use internationally for years, companies that produce packaging products pay fees into a producer responsibility organization that uses those funds to improve recycling infrastructure and education. Tennessee’s bill would exempt small businesses that make less than $10 million in annual revenue, meaning that fees would be paid mostly by larger, national or multinational companies.

Campbell said the bill has built momentum since its introduction last year. The bill’s proponents have collected letters of support from several industry operators and a collection of Tennessee mayors from major cities and some rural communities, most recently including a letter from Dyer County Mayor David Quick.
But skepticism remains. A handful of states that have adopted EPR for packaging (many have EPR laws for specific products like batteries, paint and mattresses) are early in their implementation. 
Michael Hoffman, President and CEO of the National Waste and Recycling Association, countered that EPR does not improve recycling recovery rates or secondary markets. Hoffman told lawmakers that content commitments from producers — steady streams of recyclable materials — would stabilize secondary markets and encourage private capital investments in recycling infrastructure.
The state of trash
Regional landfill capacity and remaining life are on the decline in Tennessee, said Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Bureau of Environment Advisor Jeremy Hooper. Attempts to create new landfills or expand existing landfills are also seeing more pushback on the local level. 
“There’s less and less space over time, as population expands, for landfills,” Hooper told lawmakers during a January Senate Energy, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee meeting. “Those that are permitted are larger and more regional in nature, and there’s increasing demand on those, especially as landfills are denied expansions.”
Class I landfills, which accept the bulk of solid waste, currently have an estimated 10-plus years of life remaining in West and East Tennessee, Hooper said. But Middle Tennessee landfills are quickly approaching their limits. 
Middle Point Landfill — Middle Tennessee’s largest — has been a source of contention for years, with Murfreesboro leaders and residents opposing expansion plans and raising environmental concerns.
While the issue is regional now, that won’t always be the case, Hooper said.
“If a landfill closes down in Middle Tennessee, that has to go somewhere … waste going there right now could end up into the eastern or western grand divisions,” he said.
Landfills are expensive to run and time-consuming to permit, Hooper added, and as more landfills reach maximum capacity, waste will have to be transported elsewhere, adding to disposal costs.
Meanwhile, recycling markets and infrastructure are limited in Tennessee, making recycling more expensive as goods must be transported elsewhere for processing and reuse.  
“The take-home message for recycling is it has and continues to play a role in Tennessee, but the economics of recycling continue to make landfilling a cheaper disposal in many cases,” Hooper said.
Rep. Chris Todd, a Jackson Republican, has expressed his doubts about the cost of recycling compared to putting recyclable materials like cans and bottles into landfills. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
During a task force meeting on Jan. 22, Rep. Chris Todd, a Jackson Republican, asked if the value of recycled material to end users is high enough to support the cost of recycling on its own.
Memphis Solid Waste Director Philip Davis told the task force that right now, it’s not, but the dynamics are complex and depend on the volume of recycled material and transportation costs. If Tennessee had more local processors, for example, the value of the recycled material changes.
“The resource that I believe we’re conserving is the landfill airspace,” Davis said. “We’re trying to conserve that for industry,” instead of filling it up with materials that should be composted or diverted.
While Todd said it’s a “no brainer” that compostable materials should not go to landfills, he said he can’t see his constituents being willing to pay more to recycle items like cans and bottles if it’s cheaper to put them in a landfill.
Steering recycling away from landfills
The task force, created in 2025 by the legislature to plot a strategy for Tennessee waste through 2050, has heard hours of statements from waste industry professionals, county and state waste officials, think tanks, recycling advocates and more over the last several months.
“We’ve heard it time and time again with every presentation … we need consistency, we need some standardization,” committee member Donna Barrett said.
She will work with Todd and Sen. Shane Reeves to draft a bill to create the diversion council.










I may have a county that is so small that the mayor is the solid waste director … they don’t have time to interview a waste to energy (company) — a glass pickup company. They just don’t … have the bandwidth for that.


– Donna Barrett, Tennessee Solid Waste Task Force 


Barrett, whose record of service in Tennessee includes stints as a state representative and election commissioner, said the diversion council could be structured similar to the Tennessee Election Commission.
“We do not tell counties which election equipment to use, we tell them which ones are certified,” Barrett said, using the election commission as an example.
Training and education would be the same from county to county, but individual counties could use the diversion council as a “clearing house” or information repository to determine which options best fit them, she said. 
“I may have a county that is so small that the mayor is the solid waste director … they don’t have time to interview a waste to energy (company) — a glass pickup company. They just don’t … have the bandwidth for that.”
The council could be tasked with speaking with solid waste directors across the state, identifying needs and solutions, vetting vendors, setting vendor standards, providing standardized recycling layouts and signage for recycling and convenience centers, and standardizing education and awareness programs, Barrett suggested.
There are many details to work out, including the council’s size, membership, and funding. 
“I think we have an opportunity legislatively, and it’s got to happen fairly quickly,” Todd said, noting that new revenue will be tough to find this year, and looking to reassign existing money to fund a council might be more realistic.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado schools that rely on workers from other countries could face staffing difficulties under the Trump administration’s implementation of a $100,000 fee for the visa those workers must obtain.
H-1B visas allow U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in tech and other specialized jobs. In education, they could include teachers, professors and researchers. 
President Donald Trump in September issued a proclamation implementing a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applicants. The fee does not apply to current H-1B visa holders. Historically, the visa fees paid by companies ranged from under $1,000 to a few thousand dollars. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Trump called for American companies to rely on American workers for these roles, making unsubstantiated claims of “abuse” in the H-1B visa program.
The top H-1B employer in Colorado is the University of Colorado system, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data, though CU spokesperson Michele Ames said it is unclear exactly what the USCIS numbers reflect, since it appears only to list the university’s Denver campus.  
CU has 328 H-1B visa holders across all campuses and system offices in Boulder, Denver, Aurora and Colorado Springs, Ames said. Those people serve in various faculty, staff, research and clinical roles. 
“Each one of our visa holders are a valued member of our CU family,” Ames said in a statement. “Our ability to deliver world-class education to our more than 67,000 students, successfully compete for $1.7 billion in research funding each year, deliver life-saving treatment to thousands and provide $12.2 billion in economic impact to our state and nation rely — in part — on the contributions these individuals make every day.”










Our district will not be able to pay this fee for these visas.


– Scott Pribble, spokesperson for Denver Public Schools


Schools and universities use H-1B visas to hire for positions that can be difficult to fill, according to Dan Berger, a senior attorney with Path2Papers, a clinic at Cornell Law School that works to connect people who came to the U.S. as minors without authorization with employer-sponsored immigration options. 
“I think most colleges and universities want to hire the most qualified person for the position, and often it’s something that’s very specialized,” Berger said. “So it may be that you have the top five people in the world who work on a particular topic are spread out all over the world, and so what it does is … it takes away a potential pool of talent.” 
‘Confusion and harm’
H-1B visa holders support K-12 education as well. Denver Public Schools is the fifth biggest employer of H-1B visa holders in the state, according to USCIS data. The district’s internal tracking system based on school years shows that the district had 117 H-1B visas approved for the 2024-25 and 2025-26 school years.
The fee proclamation has caused “confusion and harm” in the district’s recruitment and hiring strategies, district spokesperson Scott Pribble said. The district’s visa holders fill high-demand positions, including Spanish bilingual elementary, math, science and special education teachers, and certain special provider roles. 
“Our district will not be able to pay this fee for these visas,” Pribble said in a statement. “It creates a problem recruiting qualified professionals, often holding multiple advanced degrees and bringing decades of classroom experience.”
With over 6,000 teachers in the district, the H-1B visa holders represent just under 2% of classroom staff. Over 30% of students in the district are English-language learners, and 34% of its students are Spanish-speaking. 
Maintaining an appropriate staffing level “is critical for the success of our students,” Pribble said, adding that the H-1B visa program has been imperative in supporting positions that teach students and offer legally mandated student services. 
“DPS competes in a constrained labor market for qualified educators and specialized staff,”  Pribble said. “In that environment, the district relies on all lawful recruiting pathways, including the ability to recruit and retain qualified candidates through the H-1B program for certain hard to fill roles.”
Graduate would have to leave
Colorado State University employs 131 H-1B visa holders. Most of those employees are facility or research associates, though some hold staff positions, CSU spokesperson Tiana Kennedy said. 
While initially it was unclear what the $100,000 proclamation covered, Berger said, it has since been clarified that it only applies to someone being hired directly from abroad. So, for example, if someone graduates with a Ph.D. from a university in the U.S. and a university wants to hire them, that would be considered a “change of status”and wouldn’t require the $100,000 fee.  
But the government still has discretion to approve status changes, and while Berger said it previously would do that “pretty freely,” it is “looking much more carefully at those cases.” 
“If a change of status is denied here, then the person would have to leave, and then the $100,000 fee would have to be paid,” Berger said. 
Since universities hire for the academic year, it is too early to tell how the changes from the Trump administration will affect CU’s hiring process, Ames said.  
“We will understand much more after we have been able to experience a full hiring cycle under the changes,” she said. 
The new visa fee is “just one of several hurdles” Denver schools have faced under the Trump administration, Pribble said. 
“The frequency of these policy shifts has created a climate of uncertainty, leading many of our teachers to seek urgent guidance,” Pribble said. “They are rightfully concerned about how these constant changes affect their professional standing and their families’ futures.”

A new class at the University of Wisconsin Law School aims to teach students about the perspectives of different people who are part of the criminal justice system, including those who are incarcerated. 
Dant’e Cottingham, one of the course instructors, was himself once locked up inside Wisconsin’s prison system. He said that according to stigma, he’s not supposed to be in the classroom.
“So I’m aware of that, and I carry that,” Cottingham said. “That’s important to me, because I want to make sure that the city, the state, the country knows that we are a lot more than our worst mistake.”
Instructing the class along with Cottingham is Adam Stevenson, a clinical professor and director of the Frank J. Remington Center, which houses the law school’s prison-based clinics as well as the public defender and prosecution externships. While Cottingham has the experience of being incarcerated in the prison system, Stevenson brings to the course the legal expertise of a law professor, and one who has worked with a program focused on legal assistance to incarcerated people. 
The Wednesday class, which has 19 students enrolled this semester,  counts for two credits. It’s titled “Criminal Justice System: A Lived Experience Perspective.” The class, examining how theory, policy and practice line up with reality — or diverge from it, according to the syllabus, may continue in the future depending on how this semester goes. 
In 1996, Cottingham was convicted of being party to a crime for first-degree intentional homicide for an offense that occurred when he was 17. While incarcerated, Cottingham applied to UW Madison’s program for legal assistance for incarcerated people and was assigned two law students who worked to help him win his release, he said. He was paroled in 2022. 
Cottingham served as interim associate director of the group Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing, and spoke publicly about Green Bay Correctional Institution, where he spent some of his imprisonment, and which has been the subject of criticism for inhumane conditions and calls to close the facility. Now 47, Cottingham is the reentry and outreach support specialist for the Remington Center. He said he helps men and women who are transitioning from incarceration.  
“I sit with people, build a rapport, get some insight and understanding to what their needs are,” Cottingham said. A person’s needs might involve housing, employment or medical care. 
Cottingham said that when he gave presentations in classes in the past,  students engaged with his description of his own experience, and he saw a need for the course he’s teaching now.
The experience of re-entering society after prison is one topic on the course schedule Cottingham shared with the Examiner. The arrest process, the trial process, sentencing, systemic inequality in criminal justice, and incarceration, and advocacy for reform and future directions are among the other course topics.
Guest speakers in the class range from Wisconsin Department of Corrections Secretary Jared Hoy, to Wood County District Attorney Jonathan Barnett, to Sharmain Harris, whose book “Rising Above the Odds: My Journey from Pain and Prison to Power and Purpose” is one of the required materials for the course. Requirements include book reports that analyze autobiographies of people who have experienced incarceration.

Jini Jasti, a spokesperson for University of Wisconsin Law School, said UW Law’s motto is “Law in Action.” She said the school does not only teach the law on the books but also encourages students to see how it works from different perspectives, such as those of prosecutors, defense attorneys, victims, defendants and prisoners.  
“This unique class complements our other offerings, allowing students to hear about our trial, appellate and prison systems from someone who’s lived it,” Jasti said in a statement. 
State Public Defender Jennifer Bias and Robert Taliaferro, who was formerly incarcerated, visited the class on Wednesday. 
Bringing in these different perspectives helps  “tease out topics that we should be discussing when we’re talking about what the law is, how the law should operate etc.,” Stevenson said in a Jan. 16 interview with the Wisconsin Examiner. “One person’s perspective is definitely great in doing that, but having multiple perspectives and the potential disagreement, or the clash, if you will, can also give rise to some really rich conversation.”  
Stevenson said students will be graduating and working with clients as attorneys, and understanding the perspectives of people in the criminal justice system is important. 
Lara Hendrix, a third year law student, is planning to be a public defender after graduation. She said she thought the class would be valuable for her future career. 
Hendrix hopes that eventually people who don’t plan to practice criminal law take the class. 
“These are real people with families, and people that love them, and other people that are affected,” Hendrix said, “and that needs so much more attention than it gets.”

(Photos courtesy of the candidates)At least three candidates plan to run for two seats on the North Dakota Public Service Commission in the 2026 election, with both incumbents announcing campaigns this month.  
Commissioner Sheri Haugen-Hoffart announced earlier this month that she will seek reelection to a six-year term. 
Haugen-Hoffart was appointed to the PSC in February 2022 and won the election for the seat the same year.
There also is a two-year term on the ballot. Julie Fedorchak was elected to a six-year term in 2022 but she gave up the seat when she was elected to Congress in 2024. 
Jill Kringstad, who was appointed in January 2025 to fill Fedorchak’s seat, announced last week that she will run for the two-year portion remaining on that term.  
Deven Styczynski of Enderlin says he also intends to run, but has not yet decided which term he would run for. 
Styczynski and other potential candidates must declare which seat they are running for when they file for candidacy with the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office. The filing deadline is April 6. 
Haugen-Hoffart, Kringstad and Styczynski are all Republicans. 
Neither Haugen-Hoffart nor Kringstad committed to seeking the nomination at the North Dakota GOP convention. Without a party nomination, candidates must gather petition signatures to get on the ballot. 
Styczynski said he would seek the party nomination for the seat he decides to file for. 
Other candidates could emerge before the April 6 deadline.
In 2024, Tracey Wilkie announced her candidacy at the Democratic-NPL state convention. She lost to incumbent Republican Randy Christmann, receiving about 30% of the vote. 
Wilkie told the North Dakota Monitor that she has not considered running this year and encouraged other candidates to come forward. 
The three-person commission oversees rates for-profit electric utilities, issues permits for infrastructure such as pipelines, powerlines and wind turbines, and manages the state’s coal mine reclamation program, among other responsibilities.  
Styczynski said he’s running for the PSC in part due to concerns about rate increases from power companies. 
He called a compromise plan to allow Xcel Energy to increase electric rates by 10% for North Dakota customers “ludicrous.” 
Haugen-Hoffart defended the pending rate increase, saying it was the first request to raise rates in four years and electric rates. 
Kringstad said abundant, reliable and affordable energy is a top priority. 
Haugen-Hoffart and Kringstad both pointed to federal reporting that says North Dakota has the lowest electricity rates in the country.

“Demand really went up,” Sheila told the Nebraska Examiner, “Like, it’s not stopped.”
A new state manufacturing modernization grant, authorized under a 2025 Nebraska law, will add a plasma cutting machine and a painter/welder to the business’ seven-person staff, allowing quicker response to custom orders coming from across the country.
FabriPlas Metal is among five small manufacturers selected from more than 50 applicants that will share $250,000. Winners are to use the state funds to develop innovative approaches to building their operations and boosting productivity, according to a statement last week from the the Nebraska Department of Labor, which oversees the program.
“I am so impressed with the commitment from businesses across the state to utilizing technology in ways that will grow and sustain their companies while also providing new employment opportunities,” said Commissioner of Labor Katie Thurber, who said her agency received over 50 applications.

The legislation, sponsored by State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area, was described as a one-time grant program to increase integration of smart technologies. Winners had to have at least three years of operation, at least three full-time employees and derive 51% of revenue from manufactured goods. 
At FabriPlas, Sheila Johnson said finding skilled workers is among the biggest challenges for the couple’s shop, whose registered name is PAJ Industries LLC. She also handles marketing and manages design work. Her husband has three decades of fabrication experience, cutting, sanding and finishing parts.
Their customer base is homeowners taking on do-it-yourself projects. But Sheila said more architects and developers are seeking their products. “We are so backed up,” she said.

Today, workers in all those states are bringing home paychecks that are far fatter than those of Michigan workers. That’s because those states made the transition to a knowledge economy that largely bypassed Michigan, according to a study by a University of Michigan economist.
“We were so concerned with keeping auto jobs that we missed the stuff that was coming,” said Don Grimes, who has forecast Michigan’s economy for decades and who counts himself among those who initially didn’t fully grasp how the economy was fundamentally shifting to high-wage, high-education-attainment service jobs.
The wage gaps between Michigan and what Grimes described as benchmark states are startling. Adjusted for cost of living, real wages in Massachusetts last year were an average $16,116 per worker higher than in Michigan, while Texas wages were $5,513 higher.
In 1990, North Carolina workers earned an average $8,598 less than Michigan workers. Today they bring home $566 more than their Michigan counterparts.
North Carolina’s economy has largely shifted away from employment in tobacco, textiles and furniture to higher-wage jobs in financial services, pharmaceuticals and various technologies.
“North Carolina used to have a higher concentration of manufacturing than Michigan did,” Grimes told me. “They’ve made the transition to a knowledge economy really well.”

And it’s not just those states that became far wealthier than Michigan over the past four decades. In 1990, Michigan’s cost-of-living adjusted wages were 9.5% higher than the national average, the sixth highest in the nation.
Today, the state’s wages are 4.2% lower than the national average despite Michigan’s relatively low cost of living, the U of M study said.
For decades, Michigan prospered from a healthy wage premium in manufacturing and other blue-collar jobs. But that premium has fallen from about $11,500 above the national average in 1990 to just $3,051 in 2024. Plus, the share of blue-collar jobs to total Michigan jobs has fallen from 32.9% in 1990 to 27% percent in 2024.
“We’re getting relatively poorer,” Grimes said. “We want to see our glory days. Now it’s a new formula.”
That new formula is a big concentration of high-wage jobs in areas such as information technology and financial services that can lift wages overall. Those are areas where Michigan lags far behind.
The state does possess thousands of good-paying engineering jobs. But many of those are connected to the auto industry, which pay far less than in other high-tech industries.
Michigan’s efforts to protect those positions, as well as auto factory jobs, have not succeeded. Michigan has lost about half of its auto manufacturing jobs since 1990. And many white-collar auto technology jobs have moved to Silicon Valley, Tennessee and other places, Grimes said.
“That’s really sort of depressing,” he said.
Michigan also has fallen far below the nation and benchmark states in wages paid in private-sector, high-wage service industries. Those jobs paid an average $88,655 in the state in 2024, about $11,000 less than the national average.
Those Michigan wages were an average $27,855 less than in Massachusetts, $10,494 less than in North Carolina and $9,377 behind Texas.
Closing those gaps will require a “massive revamp” of economic development efforts and attitudes by residents and policymakers about how Michigan can regain its wealth standing, Grimes said.
“It’s astounding what Michigan did in the ‘40s, ‘50s and ‘60s,” he said. “But we’re still looking backward. Everybody’s got to think differently.”

That’s a tall order at a time when politicians on both sides of the aisle are preaching the gospel of manufacturing as economic salvation, and when universities that produce high-wage workers are under attack by the Trump administration and many Republicans.
Grimes said the reality is that Michigan needs to attract more rich people who can boost the state’s wealth with their own incomes and the wages their companies provide. He’s blunt about that view, which he admits that candidates for political office this year are unlikely to embrace.
“Michigan should only give subsidies for jobs that pay over $100,000, and that should go up over time,” he said. “We need to eliminate the idea of trying to bring in factories” to create wealth. “You have to focus on jobs that pay a lot.”
While Grimes is not particularly confident that Michigan can catch up to other states that have transitioned to a knowledge economy any time soon, he said the state has powerful economic development tools — “extraordinary” water resources and world-class universities it can promote to attract the best and brightest.
West Michigan is outperforming the rest of the state in part because of its proximity to Lake Michigan, which is attracting investment from wealthy Chicagoans, Grimes said. The state could step up efforts to attract more wealthy job creators from the Windy City, among other places, he said.

(Photo courtesy of Joy Holmes)Joy Holmes, a mother from Conway who homeschools her two children, has depended on PBS’ content over the past several years. Beloved characters Clifford the Big Red Dog and Wild Kratts are like family for her kids, who are on the autism spectrum.
While her children struggle to connect with people, “it’s much easier to connect with a show and connect with characters” from those long-running programs, Holmes said.
“It’s a fundamental part of our day,” Holmes said. “We don’t have a day where we’re not using the [PBS] kids’ programming.”
As Arkansas prepares to become the first state in the nation to disaffiliate from PBS, leaders of the rebranded Arkansas TV insist they’re keeping viewers in mind as they replace Big Bird, Ken Burns and Daniel Tiger with locally-made productions.
“What we have the opportunity to do now is to march boldly forward with a business model that can work for the long term,” Carlton Wing, the former Republican lawmaker who is now Arkansas TV’s CEO, said at a Little Rock Rotary Club meeting this month.

But interviews with parents like Holmes and feedback the state has received show the challenges the public television network faces in winning over those viewers. 
If the agency breaks away from PBS headquarters on July 1 as planned, the shows Holmes’ children enjoy will be available online and on the free PBS KIDS app, but no longer on television.
The Arkansas PBS Commission voted 6-2 in December to cut ties with the national network. The decision came as a shock to PBS headquarters and to Arkansans throughout the state, according to correspondence with Arkansas TV that the Arkansas Advocate obtained via a public records request.
In his Rotary Club address, Wing said the same thing he told the PBS Commission: No longer having to pay PBS dues was the only way to keep the network afloat. The network lost $2.5 million in programming and operational funds after the Corporation for Public Broadcasting lost federal funding last summer, and CPB officially shut down this month.
Holmes called the disaffiliation “an ideological move.” Dozens of Arkansans made similar comments in emails to Arkansas TV.
“As an Arkansas educator, I am profoundly concerned that the shortsighted desire to eradicate PBS that was driven by Republican leaders nationally and led by President [Donald] Trump deprives children across the nation of the wonderful programming that explores history, culture, and diverse voices,” one viewer wrote.

Public Comment 20 
Another viewer said the availability of PBS kids’ shows exclusively online is untenable because “many families do not have a dedicated computer/laptop for their child/children to use.” 
 Financial concerns

Katie Cramer, Wing’s executive assistant, answered many frustrated emails with the same response. She repeated Wing’s financial argument and said the network’s “attempts to negotiate lower annual dues were, unfortunately, unsuccessful.”
Some viewers who complained noted Arkansas’ growing budget surplus.
“If this was a priority, it would be taken care of by the legislature and the governor,” a viewer from Fayetteville wrote.
Cramer wrote in response that Wing would support rejoining PBS if the network were able to negotiate lower dues and that he “has been a genuine supporter of PBS for a long time.”

Wing was a Republican state representative from 2017 until September, when he resigned to take over the public television network. He was among the lawmakers who urged their colleagues to pass the network’s appropriation bill in 2024, when the bill passed after three attempts. The appropriation took five attempts to pass the House in 2025.

Due to this years-long struggle, asking the state to give the network more spending authority “is not realistic,” Wing said.
The network has caught the ire of some Republican state lawmakers, including Jonesboro Sen. Dan Sullivan, who last year unsuccessfully pushed for abolishing the Arkansas PBS commission.
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed Sullivan’s wife, Maria Sullivan, to the PBS Commission in 2024. She was among the commissioners who voted to cut ties with PBS.
 Projected viewership losses

Holmes spent years in Japan as part of a military family, and her PBS Passport subscription allows her to watch Japanese TV programs that remind her of her childhood, she said.
Those who pay $60 per year can access PBS Passport’s full library of programs, including Antiques Roadshow and Masterpiece Theatre. Wing has repeatedly said Passport will allow Arkansans to keep watching shows that will no longer be on TV, but Holmes said the cost is significant for her single-income household.
Some viewers are threatening to not just tune out, but no longer give.
“As I grew up, my worldview expanded with shows such as Rick Steves’ and Ken Burns’ numerous documentaries,” one person wrote to Arkansas TV. “After a decade in a neighboring state, I moved back to Arkansas and my wife and I are raising children in this great state. We are also new contributors to Arkansas PBS… However, I am disgusted by this decision and I will not be giving to this new entity.”
The Arkansas PBS Foundation, which manages donations to the network, provided a one-time emergency fund of $1.5 million last year to support both operating expenses and about half of the national dues. Wing and Cramer said this effort is unlikely to be repeatable.

Arkansas PBS Foundation CEO Marge Betley told viewers in an August 2025 marketing email that enough support from donors would allow the network to “continue delivering the trusted, inspiring programming that you value” despite the loss of CPB funding.
Holmes said she will continue subscribing to Passport via another state’s PBS station even though the app’s selection of programs varies state by state. Several viewers who contacted Arkansas TV about the disaffiliation said they will similarly redirect their subscriptions and donations.
“I’m 71 and have faithfully watched PBS my entire life,” wrote a viewer from Harrison. “Please reconsider the decision to leave the PBS system. I will switch viewership to another PBS station otherwise.”

Public Comment 34 
 Programming alternatives

Arkansas TV’s mission is to produce original, Arkansas-focused programming, and some content creators in the state have already contacted the network about potential collaborations, Wing said.
“We are bringing it back home to educational content for Arkansans so that we can grow and make sure that this public television model works for the next generation,” he said.
When asked if Arkansas TV has any processes to ensure its original programming is unbiased, Wing said the network will work with the state Department of Education to “make sure that anything that goes through our educational content matches Arkansas standards.”
The education department did not have any documentation related to those efforts, a spokesperson said in response to a public records request from the Advocate.
PBS programs will continue airing on Arkansas TV until June 30 unless the commission votes to reverse its decision to disaffiliate. 
A viewer from Jasper said PBS shows are providing “a positive alternative to graphic violence and sex seen on mainstream television.” Holmes agreed that PBS’ kids’ shows can’t be replicated anywhere else.
“The other stuff that’s free is just crap and not good for brains, and especially not good for autistic brains,” Holmes said. “So this loss is really big for us.”

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)After North Carolina’s two largest medical providers halted gender-affirming care for patients below the age of 19, trans youth in the state are left with few options for treatment.
Ahead of a looming Trump administration crackdown on treatments like hormone replacement therapy — which substitutes sex-related hormones like estrogen or testosterone to physically transition patients’ bodies to align with their gender identity — for patients 18 and younger, Advocate Health and UNC Health have ended such gender-affirming care for anyone under 19.
“It’s very disappointing that they would do this,” said Ivy Johnson, an attorney with the ACLU of North Carolina. “It’s completely ignoring the fact that 18-year-olds are adults in this country, and I think it’s irresponsible to discontinue care for people who’ve already been under a certain course of treatment.”
The restrictions adopted by UNC Health and Advocate Health exceed a North Carolina law passed in 2023 over then-Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto that barred minors from receiving gender-affirming care, but exempted patients already undergoing treatment due to health risks associated with halting care.

Just eight days into his second term, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the Health and Human Services Department to crack down on medical interventions such as puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy, and other treatments aimed at facilitating gender transition for patients under 19.
That manifested in December as a set of HHS regulations that would condition Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program for hospitals on compliance with federal restrictions on gender-affirming care, among other measures intended to pressure health care providers.
Now, trans youth in North Carolina who are not yet 19 will be forced to halt their care, find alternate providers in a state with dwindling options, or leave the state for treatment.
Heron Greenesmith, deputy director of the Transgender Law Center, stressed that the proposed HHS restrictions are not set to take effect for months, and that hospitals choosing to end care early are doing so voluntarily. “Right now, there is no ban.”
“Pre-compliance has been a problem for trans-supporting, trans-inclusive organizations and agencies across the country, not just for trans-affirming care,” Greenesmith said. “It could be fear for funding or for retribution from the federal government.”
While federal opposition to gender-affirming care focuses on health risks of procedures — with Trump’s executive order warning that some recipients “will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding” — Johnson and Greenesmith both warned of complications from suddenly stopping gender-affirming care.
“You’ll have physical changes that can be rapid,” Greenesmith said. “The return of dysphoria is going to be a big impact and that obviously has mental health impacts, including an increased risk of suicidality and suicidal ideation, and then the other kind of emotional and mental health crises, anxiety, depression, PTSD.”
Advocate Health, which oversees state provider Atrium Health, implemented the restrictions in August. UNC Health began notifying patients in September that care would be discontinued, though no public announcement accompanied the policy shift. Both hospital systems have been connecting affected patients with support resources, including a newly established 24/7 hotline at Advocate aimed at providing counseling.
UNC Health spokesman Alan Wolf said in a statement that concerns over the federal regulatory environment prompted the decision to restrict care.
“UNC Health follows state and federal law related to medical services around gender transition. While state law limits these services to patients 18 and older, given the unsettled state of federal guidelines, last year we began limiting these services to individuals age 19 or older,” Wolf said. “UNC Health remains committed to caring and treating all patients.”
In comments to NC Health News last year, Advocate Health raised similar concerns: “This new policy allows our hospitals, clinics and pharmacies to continue caring for all patients’ health needs in the changing federal environment.”
Duke Health, whose policy on gender-affirming care for minors remains unchanged according to their website, now has a several-months wait for those wishing to switch to their services.
“Due to increasing demand, we are currently booking new patient appointments several months out,” the page for the Duke Child and Adolescent Gender Care Clinic reads. “We are working on strategies to accommodate this increased demand. Thank you for your patience.”
Duke Health did not respond to multiple requests for comment on their gender-affirming care policies or whether patients who have lost access to care from other providers may receive expedited appointments.

The HHS restrictions are the subject of a federal lawsuit led by Oregon and joined by 18 other states, including the District of Columbia. At the state level, hospitals themselves are facing litigation. In Colorado, several families sued Children’s Hospital Colorado in state court over its suspension of gender-affirming care for minors, which has halted treatment for around 800 patients.
But North Carolina officials have declined to take action. Attorney General Jeff Jackson did not join the challenge to the administration’s policies, despite participating in a series of high-profile lawsuits against Trump executive actions last year, meaning state providers will not benefit from any injunction against the HHS restrictions.
North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Summer Tonizzo said in a statement that “gender dysphoria care is not covered by any NC Medicaid plans,” citing the 2023 state law, when asked about the department’s response to hospital restrictions.
Johnson, the ACLU NC attorney, said she believes hospitals may be illegally discriminating against patients on the basis of sex by suspending gender-affirming care.
“This seems unconstitutional and dangerous on the part of these hospitals, whose functions are otherwise supposed to be to provide medically necessary care to their patients,” Johnson said. “I would encourage people to reach out to us.”

(Greg Jordan | Bluefield Daily Telegraph) After two widespread flooding events hit communities in both southern and northern West Virginia last year, taking lives and wrecking numerous structures, the Legislature is eyeing changes to how money could be disbursed following such catastrophes.
Two similar bills — House Bill 4018 and Senate Bill 390 — are advancing through the Legislature’s separate bodies. They would revise the rules that dictate how money is given out from the state’s Flood Resiliency Trust Fund and what projects or individuals qualify as being a priority for funding.
While it’s early in the session, those two bills — plus one to require dredging in flood-prone waterways to lower the likelihood of flooding — are the only ones introduced so far this session related to flooding. Meanwhile, flooding disasters are likely to become more commonplace in the state as floodplains grow and as prevention efforts stall.
Both HB 4018 and SB 390 would give the State Resiliency Officer authority to disburse funds to individuals, local governments, state agencies or other organizations after a flooding event as long as the projects align with the state’s official Flood Resiliency Plan.
They would require that at least half of all money given through the trust fund goes toward “nature-based solutions,” including restoring wetlands and improving floodplains, buying out flood-prone properties or helping residents relocate out of high-risk areas. A portion of the funding would be specifically set aside for property acquisition and similar mitigation efforts.
Local governments seeking funding would need to adopt or commit to flood-related standards, including hazard mitigation planning, emergency operations plans and, in some cases, participation in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Community Rating System.
Overall, any dollars distributed through the trust fund must be used to enhance flood prevention, with particular emphasis on low-income communities and those that have experienced repeated flooding.
But even if new guidelines for spending are adopted by the Legislature, the fund they apply to — the state’s Flood Resiliency Trust Fund — remains empty as it has never been allocated money since its inception in 2023. Neither has the state’s Flood Recovery Trust Fund. 
While Gov. Patrick Morrisey is asking to move $10 million to the Flood Resiliency Trust Fund in his proposed state budget, that money would go toward developing a warning system to give residents in flood-prone areas more notice and, hopefully, save lives.
Money to help with recovery and prevent devastating flooding in the first place, however, would still be lacking.
Under former Gov. Jim Justice, the Republican-controlled Legislature repeatedly opted against sending money to the trust fund despite requests from Justice, even while leaders boasted about record-setting revenue coming into the state.
In the House of Delegates this past legislative session, only 19 lawmakers — every Democrat in the House and 10 Republicans — voted in support of an amendment to the proposed state budget that would have put $50 million in the fund.
Last June, after flooding in northern West Virginia cost nine people their lives, Morrisey said he planned to have “additional discussions with the Legislature and others about the importance of flood prevention.”
But in his State of the State address earlier this month, the only flood measure mentioned by Morrisey was the early warning system; overall flood prevention or recovery was not made a priority and funding for either initiative remains lacking.
Earlier this month, disaster recovery experts told members of the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Flooding that a lack of funds were making it difficult for case managers to help individuals with long-term recovery, including issues related to housing, rebuilding and more.
Lora Pierce, a disaster recovery specialist with Catholic Charities West Virginia, said that acute recovery — mucking out buildings, removing fallen trees, meeting immediate resource needs for those impacted by flooding — isn’t much of a problem in the state because there are so many groups that volunteer.
“It’s that long-term recovery, six months after the fact when all of the immediate needs may have been met,” Pierce said. “The biggest challenge and hurdle is having disaster case managers work with these people on their recovery to get them back to a safe and secure home.”
Pierce said nearly all long-term recovery efforts are taken on by volunteers. In some events — including last year’s flooding in Southern West Virginia — Pierce said there are “no disaster case managers at all” to help with recovery. Part of this, she said, is because there is little money available to pay people for these necessary services. 
Because there is not any state money put aside for flood recovery, Pierce said any funds that do come in for communities are either from local charities and nonprofit organizations or from the federal government.
Pierce said she would like to see the state remodel its trust funds to reflect the federal government’s to ensure that families receive money directly, but also that case managers and other necessary positions can be filled and compensated.
Nearly $41 million was distributed federally to families affected by flooding in the coalfields last February. That money was necessary, Pierce said, but she questioned how things will look in the future given the instability at the FEMA.
Catherine Carr Clinch, president of Tidal Basin, a disaster service provider, told lawmakers in the same meeting they should be aware that “it’s unclear what the future of funding for the federal government (following disasters) looks like.”
“FEMA’s role is changing, and the agency may no longer have the same capacity or ability to support the states,” Clinch said. “… We strongly advise you to consider funding (the Flood Resiliency Trust Fund and the Flood Recovery Trust Fund).”
HB 4018 is currently under consideration by the House Committee on Government Organization. SB 390 will be on first reading in the Senate on Monday.

(Getty Images)Wolverines in the Lower 48 states were trapped, hunted and poisoned to near extinction in the late 1800s and early 1900s and have not recovered, just the opposite in fact. It took court action by the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and other conservation groups to finally get the dwindling population listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in 2023.
The federal government is legally required to designate “critical habitat” to protect ecosystems for the recovery of threatened and endangered species, but has failed to do so for wolverines, which are hanging on by the thinnest of threads. To stave off extinction, we need to protect the habitat in which they can survive — a challenge now further exacerbated by an increasingly hot climate diminishing the deep snows they require for denning and food storage.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service noted that wolverine populations are relatively small, fragmented and isolated from larger populations in Canada. The Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that roughly 50 wolverines occupied the Idaho/Montana linkage area at the time of listing. They also estimated that roughly 63 wolverines live in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
It’s estimated there are only 318 wolverines remaining in the entire Lower 48 states. Scientists believe the “effective population,” which is the number of individuals capable of reproducing and contributing to the next generation, is likely less than 40.
You read that right, fewer than 40 wolverines are currently capable of keeping the species from going extinct in the contiguous U.S. And what is the U.S. Fish and Wild Service doing to recover wolverines as required by law? Not much.
To protect the ecosystems upon which wolverines depend, the Endangered Species Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to designate “critical habitat” — the areas that provide the secure habitat where they are protected from threats like incidental trapping and can successfully reproduce.
The designation of “critical habitat” includes those areas occupied by the species at the time of listing that possess the physical and biological features such as food, water and shelter needed for survival and recovery. These areas may also include areas not yet occupied but needed for future population growth.
Because critical habitat designation is essential to the conservation of the species, special management consideration or protections may be required. The designation also guides federal actions to prevent destruction or modification of this habitat, thereby increasing species’ chances of recovery.
Unfortunately the Fish and Wildlife Service has not followed the law, has not designated critical habitat, and is shirking its duty to keep wolverines from extinction — which is why the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and our fellow plaintiffs recently filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Montana.
Although the majority (95%) of wolverine habitat in the Lower 48 states is federally owned and managed by the U.S. Forest Service, there are no regulatory mechanisms or standards in Forest Service Land and Resource Management Plans to protect wolverines and their habitat. Not only is nothing being done to protect and restore wolverines and the ecosystems upon which they depend, the Forest Service has announced a massive 25% increase in national forest logging, in effect, destroying what critical habitat may be left on public lands.
The Fish and Wildlife Service has failed — and continues to fail — to comply with its mandatory, non-discretionary, duty to designate critical habitat for wolverines as required by Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act. To maintain and recover the species our choice was either take the delinquent agency to court or watch wolverines dwindle into extinction. We sided with the wolverines and are being represented by the Western Environmental Law Center.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The Mississippi Department of Corrections quietly entered into an agreement with a powerful law firm last summer to monitor its private medical contractor after Mississippi Today reports of alleged denial of health care in state prisons. 
The move comes after the state Legislature instructed the department to deliver a report on the contractor’s performance and nearly a year after the agency entered into a medical services contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars it was responsible for overseeing. The Corrections Department hired Butler Snow, a politically connected law firm in Mississippi that has defended prison systems and private prison health contractors in civil rights lawsuits alleging health care failures in several states, to monitor its prison medical contract, a letter obtained by Mississippi Today reveals. 
The letter, which has not previously been reported, from Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain to Senate Appropriations Chairman Briggs Hopson, a Republican from Vicksburg, says a Butler Snow attorney will manage a team “experienced in correctional healthcare management” to conduct contract oversight. The state Personnel Board approved the agreement with Butler Snow in August, the letter says.  
Kansas-based VitalCore Health Strategies, LLC, holds a three-year contract worth over $357 million to provide medical services to people incarcerated in Mississippi prisons. The company has increasingly come under scrutiny after a state lawmaker raised the alarm about numerous inmates suffering from treatable illnesses and Mississippi Today began investigating the alleged routine denial of health care in Mississippi prisons. 
Mississippi Today’s Behind Bars, Beyond Care series has documented potentially thousands of people living with hepatitis C going without treatment, an untreated broken arm that resulted in amputation and delayed cancer screenings one woman said led to a terminal diagnosis. One ex-corrections official said people are experiencing widespread medical neglect in Mississippi’s prisons and turned over internal messages bemoaning the contractor’s care to Mississippi Today. 
In a statement, VitalCore spokesperson Timothy Keck said the company would comply with the new team monitoring its work.
“VitalCore’s commitment to our patients is the same regardless of any oversight,” Keck said. “We will comply with any audit and inspection and will fully engage with the MDOC in that process.”
MDOC spokesperson Kate Head did not respond to a request for comment. 
The agreement with the Department of Corrections tasks Butler Snow with compiling a team that includes a licensed physician, a licensed mental health professional and a person with experience in correctional health care management. The team will complete an initial review of health and mental health services, identify urgent performance issues and develop tools to monitor the contractor’s work. It will also recommend clawbacks — or the recovery of funds already paid — for contract requirements that are not met. 
Many of the issues the monitoring team will review, such as infectious disease control and infirmary operations, mirror concerns raised by Rep. Becky Currie, chairwoman of the House Corrections Committee, who has been attempting to pass new legislation forcing the Corrections Department and VitalCore to improve their delivery of medical care to prisoners. 
Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven, tried to introduce a sweeping set of reforms in 2025 that included giving the Mississippi State Department of Health the authority to monitor prison health care. The bill was defeated, in part due to opposition from the Office of Gov. Tate Reeves, who wanted to award monitoring authority to a private firm, according to Currie. 
“Yet, we spend $700,000 on a report,” Currie previously said to Mississippi Today. 
Butler Snow received a one-year contract worth $687,000 for these services. According to the letter to Hopson, the Department of Corrections held an orientation meeting with the compliance team Nov. 10 and crafted a site visit schedule, beginning with a visit to the Central Mississippi Correctional Center in “early 2026.”
Butler Snow has been paid about $249,000 so far for its monitoring work, according to state records. 
The initial contract year with Butler Snow does not include review of dental, dialysis, vision, discharge planning or long-term care. In a December report, the state’s legislative watchdog agency found that Mississippi prisoners were likely left without adequate dental care for months as the state’s private prison health care contractor failed to meet staffing requirements and the Department of Corrections failed to document the problem.
A bill passed by lawmakers in 2025 ordered the Department of Corrections to use $690,000 of funds clawed back from VitalCore to monitor and review the health contract and provide a report to lawmakers by Dec. 15. 
Currie believed she would have a completed audit in hand heading into the 2026 legislative sessions. But she learned in late December that the monitoring team had only just been retained, and their work had not begun, she said.
“Everyone left thinking that we were getting an audit and we appropriated money to do it,” Currie said. “Not getting an audit that we were promised has haunted so much.”
Currie has again introduced a wide range of reforms in 2026. 
This year’s bills would establish a corrections ombudsman to investigate health care related complaints, establish hepatitis C and HIV treatment programs, provide kiosks for prisoners to request medical attention and require correctional officers to wear body cameras. But most of the bills have been double-referred, meaning they must be passed by two committees before a full vote. That is sometimes a sign that a bill doesn’t have the support of a chamber’s leadership.
William “Bill” Lunsford, the Butler Snow attorney MDOC tapped to lead the contract monitoring team, has represented the Alabama Department of Corrections in civil rights cases, defending the agency against claims of inadequate health care. Since 2018, the corrections agency has paid him over $40 million for legal services, according to Alabama Department of Finance online records. 
Lunsford has defended the department in Braggs vs. Alabama Department of Corrections, a lawsuit filed in 2014 by people incarcerated in Alabama and the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program that alleged the agency denied health care. The lawsuit alleged prisoners were denied hepatitis C treatment, echoing claims from people incarcerated in Mississippi, and that prisoners lost the use of their arms and legs after medical treatment was denied or delayed. A similar case played out in Mississippi when a man with a broken arm had a limb amputated after he was allegedly denied care. 
Lunsford previously sat on the board of YesCare, a Tennessee-based private prison medical contractor formerly called Corizon Health, Inc. He also defended Corizon in a class action lawsuit filed by people in Idaho Department of Corrections custody living with hepatitis C who alleged the agency refused to administer treatment in line with standards of care. 
In July, Lunsford and two of his colleagues at Butler Snow were disqualified by a federal judge in a case where he represented former Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn, after one of Lunsford’s colleagues admitted to inadvertently including made-up citations generated by artificial intelligence in court filings. 
Lunsford has litigated and resolved numerous class actions against correctional agencies and vendors and regularly advises clients on compliance and liability issues related to correctional health care standards, according to his profile on Butler Snow’s website. 
Butler Snow also wrote the Mississippi Department of Correction’s request for proposals for the medical contract. 
Lunsford did not respond to Mississippi Today’s request for comment. 
The agreement with Butler Snow raises questions about whether MDOC was monitoring the medical contract before it retained the law firm last summer. 
The contract executed by the agency in October 2024 tasked the department with monitoring the contract, including reviewing service levels, quality of care and administrative practices, meeting with VitalCore to address issues, conducting site visits and inspections and reviewing third-party reimbursements, according to the contract. The agency did not respond to Mississippi Today’s questions about its prior monitoring activities. 
In the agency’s request for proposals for a medical contractor in 2023, it wrote that the agency “does not employ any licensed personnel responsible with oversight of its contracted healthcare provider,” but said it planned to reestablish a medical compliance office within three to six months of executing the contract. 
At that time, VitalCore had served as the agency’s medical contractor since 2020 after being awarded four no-bid emergency contracts worth $324 million for the services. Combined with its current role, VitalCore has been awarded about $682 million in Mississippi corrections contracts.
This year, the agency requested an additional $250,000 in funding from the state Legislature to fund five program auditor positions to provide oversight of the contracted medical provider. 
“The presence of Program Auditors will instill confidence in both our organization and the public that we are fulfilling our duty to provide essential care and safeguard the health and well-being of the inmates entrusted to our care,” the agency’s budget request said.
VitalCore has struggled to meet the terms of its contract. According to documents obtained by Mississippi Today, the Department of Corrections clawed back $4.6 million from VitalCore during the 2025 fiscal year. Mississippi Today reported in June that even as the agency was clawing back funds for unmet requirements, VitalCore requested and received an additional $4 million to cover the increased costs of providing health care.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/17162611/MT-Prison-Health-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2026-01-26 06:57:06.815397

Read that again. Thank you, Anitra Hamilton and Kayla Young. Wish there were 132 more of you. 
On the other side of the aisle, there’s nine Republican women in the House and four in the Senate.
Some facts: The Mountain State has the lowest percentage of Democrat and female lawmakers in the nation. Democrats — about 8%. Women — about 11%. 
Is that why we rank dead last in nearly every metric of family prosperity and wellness? Hmmm. Let me think. I’ll get back to you on that. Just kidding. 
Women are half the population. Yet their voices fall on many deaf ears. West Virginia has yet to have a female governor. And only one female member of the U.S Senate or House. 
It was inspirational watching Virginia elect their first female governor this year. 
Good news: Our five largest cities all had female mayors at one time. Morgantown has had six. They currently have Mayor Danielle Trumble. 
Charleston’s first female mayor is the current one: Amy Shuler Goodwin. She’s adroitly captained a Charleston revival of sorts. Emphasizes outdoor activities and fitness, arts, music and entertainment. 
Goodwin brought the much beloved Sternwheel Regatta festival back from the brink. And found a way for Charleston to host the five-year USA Cycling Pro Road National Championships. 
Her vision has strengthened West Virginia families. This is telling. Statistically, female politicians put forward more pro-family policies. 
And we’d be remiss not to praise Charlene Marshall in Morgantown. Now in her 90s, she moves like a spry 80-year-old, mind sharp as a quill. She was Morgantown’s mayor from 1991 to 1998, as well as West Virginia’s first Black mayor. She also served over a decade in the House of Delegates as a Democrat. 
So why so few women in politics? Here’s one reason: many women are taught to fear their own voice. Taught to “make nice.” Believe that a difference of opinion is bad. 
The reality? Healthy discord is fantastic. Honest, decisive opinions are signs of strength and female autonomy. Woman as their own person apart from men. In contrast, passive agreement is the devil’s dogma. It makes women invisible. 
Sometimes silence is a choice. Other times men simply talk over women or ignore them. Shameful. 
Some interesting research findings: Men and women speak and write in about the same amount, just under different circumstances. Women tend to talk more in personal and social settings. Text more. Men often speak more in business, formal and hierarchical settings. They also statistically dominate online forums and debates. Women are no less intelligent. Do not have less merit. Much is the result of sexism.
Studies also reveal the success of visibility bias. This means, the loudest voice is listened to first. Loud does not equate with smart. But we give those voices more airtime.  
Conservatives, steeped in more patriarchal values, are fragile as cicada wings. Snow. The fragility is visible in the numbers. Do they not believe women capable of leading men? Apparently not. In the U.S. House of Representatives, there are more than twice as many female Democrats as female Republicans. In the U.S. Senate, female Democrats are three times more common than their Republican counterparts. I mean, wow. 
At the state level, as of 2024, across America, women comprised 31% of Democratic legislators — and only 15% of Republican ones. That’s bananas. 
Here’s the thing: Women run the world — dominating fields in health care and education, having and rearing babies — but men rule it. Often with an iron fist. Think Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un, Vladimir Putin. I could go on. You get the idea. 
But societies are changing. More men are dismantling sexism. Some good old boys clubs are gender integrating. Businesses are hiring and promoting more women. 
Bottom line? Times are evolving. Slowly. Surely.  Women: Run for office. Speak up. Support other women. Cheer them on. Don’t go along to get along. And men? Stop and listen.

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)When teams of volunteers fan out across Rhode Island after dark Tuesday on a mission that will take them through parks, alongside highway ramps, and into alleyways and parking lots, they will need to dress warmly.
The weather forecast calls for the temperature to drop as low as six degrees in Providence. But the number that will matter the most is how many people are spending the overnight hours outside.
At least 60 volunteers are signed up to conduct the state’s annual Point in Time Count, a federally mandated census that creates a snapshot of how many people are homeless on a winter’s night. The data collected from every state is used to determine federal funding.
Jessica Lachey, director of development at Thrive Behavioral Healthcare in Warwick, will be participating in the annual census for the third consecutive year. But she and other volunteers stop by encampments all year long. During cold weather, they often pass out blankets and propane tanks to keep homeless Rhode Islanders warm. 
“We basically do this every day,” Lachey said. “We’ll bring a lot of warming gear.”
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requires every state’s Continuum of Care program — the network of agencies and nonprofits that manage a state’s homelessness response — to conduct the annual Point in Time Count.
The date of the count varies from state to state — HUD’s only requirement is that it be done within the last 10 days of January — but the goal is the same all over the country: create a snapshot of the number of individuals experiencing homelessness on a given night during the coldest time of the year when people are more likely to use shelters.
“That does typically make it easier to count, but we’ll still be outside,” said Partaja “PJ” Spann, director of Rhode Island outreach for Newport Mental Health.
Both Newport Mental Health and Thrive are Rhode Island Continuum of Care member agencies.
Unlike prior year counts, the state’s Executive Office of Housing is responsible for overseeing volunteers — a job previously handled by the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness.
State steps in to coordinate R.I.’s 2026 homeless census

The coalition will continue to clean, validate and analyze the data to submit the estimate of the state’s unhoused population to the federal government.
The final numbers will likely be submitted in April, Jenna Thomas, the coalition’s data coordinator of the state’s portion of the Homeless Management Information System, told the Rhode Island Continuum of Care board during its Jan. 7 meeting.
That’s earlier than last year when Rhode Island’s final count was submitted in June and formally presented before the state’s Continuum of Care board in September. Volunteers counted at least 2,373 unhoused individuals across the state on the night of Jan. 21, 2025 —  representing a 2.8% decrease from the record high of 2,442 in 2024.
Volunteer training is still the primary responsibility of the coalition, which produced a 17-minute video detailing how to use the state’s database. When locating unsheltered clients, volunteers must note the person’s living situation, their location, and how long they’ve been outside.
The methodology on how to approach the count follows core guidelines established by HUD. The guidelines cover how to remove duplicate data, ensure direct interaction with homeless persons, and where surveyors should go the census night.
Thomas said guidance has usually been updated on an annual basis. But during a December call with homeless data administrators from across the country, she said HUD confirmed no new notice was coming for the 2026 count and that continuum boards should use last year’s guidance.
HUD did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
7 p.m. start
Surveys for the Point in Time Count can be done for a week following the “blitz” night taking place Tuesday — as many teams likely can’t get into every encampment. The coalition’s guidance allows surveyors to visit shelters and other warming centers where they can ask where clients were during the night of the Point in Time Count. 
Emily Marshall, spokesperson for the state’s Executive Office of Housing, said about eight teams have been assembled to go out starting around 7 p.m. They’ll cover Providence, Pawtucket, along with municipalities in northern Rhode Island and in Bristol, Kent, Newport, and Washington counties.
“Teams are built intentionally to balance experience and local knowledge, ensuring coverage of both highly visible locations and more hidden or remote areas,” Marshall said in an email.
Lachey said her team expected to wrap up their survey by 11 p.m. Thrive’s outreach team is constantly out around Kent County connecting with people at known encampment locations to ensure they’re comfortable the night of the count.
“People who are unhoused have a lot of distrust in the system,” she said. “But when you see these people day in and day out — now we have a relationship, and they talk.” 
It’s the same approach Spann’s team of volunteers in Newport have taken. While the center’s outreach team likely won’t get to every encampment on Aquidneck Island Tuesday, she said individuals and their locations are fairly well-known ahead of time.
“They’re familiar faces,” Spann said. “It’s very rare we come across an encampment or an individual we have never had contact with.”
Some people are more willing to discuss their living arrangements or other personal identification than others. Spann said surveyors honor the privacy of those who don’t want to share information.
“We’re just trying to get a head count for numbers,” she said. “Data drives the narratives, the grants and the funding — getting accurate data is the first step so we know how to support the exact number of people we need to support.”

Wes Moore (D) greets Fred Hoover, then-chair of the Maryland Public Service Commission, following an executive order signing in Annapolis, on Dec. 19, 2025. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)The recent leadership shake-up at Maryland’s Public Service Commission came as Gov. Wes Moore (D) was seeking a fresh direction for the board, which regulates gas and electric utilities in the state.
The governor announced earlier this month that he had selected Kumar Barve, a longtime state delegate who has served on the Commission since 2023, after a resignation from Chair Fred Hoover, a former director of the Maryland Energy Administration and assistant people’s counsel.
“In high-performing organizations, rotating leadership at regular intervals is a smart and normal practice,” wrote Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for the governor, in response to questions from Maryland Matters about the change.
To the Moore administration, the goal of the swap is to better address continued high electric bills for Maryland consumers.
“At a time when too many families are struggling with skyrocketing utility costs, we look forward to the Commission continuing to act with urgency to protect Marylanders and ensure no one is pushed to the brink — or bankrupted — just to keep the lights on and their homes warm,” Moussa wrote.
Some argued the governor’s decision was unsurprising, given his continued dissatisfaction about high electric bills, as an election year dawns.
But other observers, including consumer and environmental advocates, called the move a rare and troubling intervention by the governor in the dealings of a body that is largely independent from the executive branch.

The governor has the power to nominate commissioners and nominate the chair, but can only remove people from the commission for incompetence or misconduct. Notably, Hoover will continue serving on the commission, with his new term extending through 2029. But he will no longer hold the noteworthy agenda-setting powers of the chair.
In a statement, Hoover said it has been “a tremendous honor to serve the people of Maryland as chair of the Public Service Commission.”
“I look forward to continued collaboration with Chair Barve and my fellow commissioners in this new capacity. We have been and will continue to be strong, unified partners in the important work of the Commission,” Hoover said.
Both men appeared side-by-side during an energy hearing Tuesday before the House Environment and Transportation Committee, though Barve took a leading role.
Since they swapped terms, both Barve and Hoover must be re-confirmed by the Maryland Senate.
The timing of the move raised some eyebrows among advocates, who noted that the PSC under Hoover recently made several consequential decisions that went against gas and electric companies.
In late December, the commission denied BGE’s request to collect an additional $152.3 million from ratepayers for a “true-up,” citing the company’s “substantial overruns” of approved budgets. Instead, it let BGE collect about half that amount, which will still add 72 cents to the average household’s monthly electric bill, and $1.95 to the average home’s gas bill, starting next month.
Earlier in 2025, the PSC issued a policy requiring new gas customers to pay the full cost for pipeline extensions to their properties, instead of letting companies spread the cost among existing ratepayers.
It is rare to see state officials intervene with the sitting members of their public utilities board, who are traditionally seen as separate from politics, said Matt Kasper, deputy director for the Energy and Policy Institute. But when it does happen, there is an “elephant in the room” — the utilities, who wield immense influence and retain ranks of lobbyists, Kasper said.
“You’re left wondering: Did the utilities pressure the legislature, or pressure the governor, to make that change?” Kasper said. “That’s what I’m left wondering here.”
Barve pushed back on that notion.










We have become much more keenly aware of costs, and we’ve been micromanaging to a degree that previous Public Service Commissions may not have. I certainly anticipate that we’re going to continue that diligence into the future.


– Kumar Barve, acting chair of the Maryland Public Service Commission


“This is about serving the ratepayers in the state of Maryland,” Barve said. “We’re honest brokers. We don’t have to raise campaign contributions. We don’t have to run for office. We have fixed terms to do what we believe is the right thing.”
Barve argued that the PSC will continue to closely scrutinize utilities’ spending plans under his leadership.
“We have become much more keenly aware of costs, and we’ve been micromanaging to a degree that previous Public Service Commissions may not have,” Barve said. “I certainly anticipate that we’re going to continue that diligence into the future.”
Christine Pendzich, a steering committee member at Maryland Third Act, a climate and democracy group for people over 60, said she found the leadership change unusual.
“From everything I understand, it’s very unusual for a Public Service Commission chair to step down before the end of his term,” said Pendzich, who has focused on energy issues and the PJM grid as co-chair of Maryland Third Act’s energy working groups.
It is “notable,” Pendzich said, that Hoover didn’t share an explanation for his departure. “One does think that the governor must have weighed in,” she said.
“The sense of the community is that he [Barve] is a little bit more politically inclined to do probably what the governor would want, rather than really balancing costs and benefits between utilities and ratepayers,” Pendzich said.
Moore, other PJM governors push for changes at the nation’s biggest electric grid

Jorge Aguilar, southern region director for advocacy group Food and Water Watch, said, “The new PSC needs to tackle these eye-popping electricity bills while rejecting the insane pro-data center frenzy that will burden ratepayers with the cost of new gas and nuclear power plants.”
Adding to Kasper’s concern are documents he recently uncovered from the governor’s office, using a public information request, that showed that American Gas Association official Juan Alvarado was the only nongovernmental employee allowed to sit in on Moore’s interviews of possible PSC appointees after he took office in 2023.
“I’ve published some information to show that the Moore administration has allowed utility influence behind the scenes,” Kasper said. “I’m left wondering … is there a coziness here?”
The Moore administration defended the involvement of the association, a trade group representing gas companies, arguing that it was purely informative. Moussa wrote that “it was not uncommon for industry experts to serve as consultants or references during the board or commission placement process.”
“Highly technical knowledge, like that required to serve on the PSC, requires appropriate insight to ensure appropriate placement. Serving in a separate capacity, consultants or references have no decision-making role and no vote on placement.”
Moore nominated Alvarado to the PSC in February 2023, but Alvarado withdrew from consideration, citing “personal reasons,” amid concerns from climate groups.
To Emily Scarr, senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, the gas industry’s presence at the meeting was “entirely inappropriate, and raises serious concerns.”
“The concern is when there is a perception that only certain people are in the room, or when things are happening behind closed doors the public isn’t aware of,” Scarr said.
Josh Tulkin, executive director of the Maryland Sierra Club, said he asked the Moore administration to attend the meetings, and was “told that non-government officials were not invited.”
But for some in Annapolis, the PSC’s recent moves aiming to rein in electric and gas utility spending may have come too little, too late.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In an interview after the leadership change, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D- Baltimore City) argued that the commission lost its way, and did not do enough to anticipate and slow down rate hikes.
“I want them to have a laser-like focus on affordability,” Ferguson said. “The pendulum swung away from from affordability, and really was exclusively on reliability and and climate purposes.”
Ferguson said, though, that the commission should “absolutely” take continued steps to scrutinize utility costs, like they did in the BGE decision in December.
“I think certainly BGE is still doing fine without the reconciliation from the last three-year rate hike,” Ferguson said. “We need in-depth analysis to make sure that any request of any additional dollars — and the potential of reducing rates — is the driving focus of the work moving forward.”
Del. C.T. Wilson (D- Charles), who worked closely on energy policy last session during his time as Economic Matters chairman, agreed. He argued that a commission leadership change was “bound to happen” amid continued blowback about high electric bills from voters. The commission also came to “repeated loggerheads” with the General Assembly, Wilson said.
He said the commission was acting more as a “rubber stamp” at a time when decisive action was needed to curtail rates before they became too high a burden. And last January, prices became a political flashpoint as legislators arrived in Annapolis.
“As a state, we’ve become wholly unprepared for what’s getting ready to hit us,” Wilson said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC02777-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

The Trump administration’s abuse of the state has caused anguish and loss for its residents, including those who voted for President Donald Trump. He has obliterated trust with the state, and it no longer makes sense for Colorado to treat the federal government as a partner.
The state would better serve its people if it took aggressive steps to disengage from the federal government, protect residents from Trump’s malevolence, and assume more responsibility for serving Coloradans.
In other words, it should pursue a “soft secession.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Individual and allied states soft secede when under federalism they leverage their autonomy to practice noncooperation with federal authority, which they substitute with their own systems.
Federal abuse in the past year is hard to exaggerate. Trump’s mass deportation program has resulted in newsmaking abuses in Minnesota, California, Illinois and Oregon, for example, but it has also disrupted lives and trampled rights in Colorado. In just one representative example, federal authorities targeted Denver immigrant rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra over protected speech, then they kept her locked up for nine months until a judge ruled she was entitled to a bond hearing.
Immigration arrests in Colorado dramatically increased in the last year, and the cases often involve scant due process. More than a third of arrests in 2025 involved people who had no criminal charges or convictions.
In addition to the harm he’s caused generally across the country, Trump has inflicted many forms of retaliation specifically against Colorado. He denied the state disaster recovery funds for wildfire and flooding. He froze federal funds in Colorado for food and child care, prompting a lawsuit from the Colorado attorney general. He vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have supported a clean water project in the southeastern part of the state. He is relocating Space Command from Colorado Springs to Alabama. He’s breaking up the world-class atmospheric science hub NCAR in Boulder.
As U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado said, “The president has declared war on our state.”
What can Colorado do?
The state can reinforce or forge alliances with other like-minded states. A model for this cooperation was established by the Democratic-led states, including Colorado, that formed the Governors Public Health Alliance in response to anti-science federal policies.
Conversely, the state can withdraw from alliances that have turned counterproductive, such as the National Governors Association, which includes the influence of Republican-led states whose leaders supported Trump’s deployment of military troops to Democratic-led cities.
Elected officials and state agencies in Colorado can strictly limit their cooperation and data-sharing with the federal government and step up the state’s own capacity to fill gaps where it previously relied on federal resources. It could start by abandoning the Colorado Information Analysis Center, one of the nation’s so-called fusion centers. These are anti-terrorism information-sharing hubs for state and federal partners under the Department of Homeland Security. Since the Trump administration labels virtually any American who opposes it a terrorist, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem zealously bases her work on that perspective, the state’s participation in the center puts every Coloradan in danger.
Gov. Jared Polis has long been eager to share other forms of information with federal authorities, such as personal data about residents who live in Colorado without authorization. This posture not only puts members of the Colorado community at risk, it’s a form of complicity.
The state has billions of dollars it invests, and how it invests matters. The state treasurer’s office and the state pension plan, the Colorado Public Employees’ Retirement Association, can allow public money to support interests that boost authoritarianism or not. Millions in public money in Colorado backs such corporate bootlickers as Palantir, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet. A state can’t say it’s opposed to fascism if it funds fascism’s accomplices.
When federal agents commit crimes in Colorado, district attorneys and other state legal authorities can hold them accountable, including through prosecution. Federal agents are protected by the Constitution if the act in question is reasonable and performed as part of official duties. But they do not enjoy absolute immunity. Attorney General Phil Weiser took a step in this direction last week when his office launched an online complaint submission form through which community members can report misconduct by federal agents.
Earlier this month, Trump said the federal government will stop making payments to “sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities,” which includes Colorado. But revenue obligations go both ways.
Colorado sends billions more to the federal government than it gets in return. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has suggested his state — which is also deemed a sanctuary jurisdiction by the administration and also sends more money to the federal government than it receives — could cut off money from California to Washington. Newsom’s office has not explained how the state would do that.
But there are ways. Some have suggested that multiple states could enter a compact and hold federal taxes in trust until the administration ceases to attack them.
This could be among the most powerful measures in a program of soft secession.

The order had directed Virginia State Police and the Department of Corrections to enter into so-called 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, effectively deputizing state officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement and encouraging local cooperation with ICE to identify and remove noncitizens accused or convicted of crimes.
Spanberger’s executive action marked a sharp policy reversal after years of Republican leadership in Richmond and came as immigration enforcement has intensified in blue states under President Donald Trump’s renewed push for large-scale deportations.
“My executive order, repealing Executive Order 47, was an important first step in ensuring that we are not moving or reallocating state and local resources away from the first-responder duties, whether it is investigating crimes or being ready to support a community in need,” Spanberger said last week.

She emphasized the prior order “had created some real challenges.”
“Ultimately, I am looking to every step forward that we can take as a commonwealth to ensure that our communities are safe and protected,” Spanberger continued, adding that confusion around law enforcement authority has fueled fear in immigrant communities. 
“Frankly, the fear and concern that we’ve seen in other places where people without any sort of designation — unannounced, wearing masks — are taking people off the streets, the level of fear that that’s created and the level of distrust and confusion is certainly not contributing to any strengthening of our communities, let alone keeping our communities safer.”
On Friday, members of Virginia’s Service Employees International Union chapters gathered outside a U.S. federal courthouse in Richmond to protest ICE enforcement, underscoring growing opposition from labor and immigrant advocates.
About 50 people attended the demonstration, where speakers criticized federal detention practices and read aloud the names of individuals who have been killed during ICE operations over the past year.
“We’re seeing the ICE escalate everywhere from from Minneapolis all the way here to Richmond,” said Violeta Vega, an SEIU member serving as an emcee for the gathering.
 State action, limited reach

While Spanberger’s order ends the requirement that state agencies enter into 287(g) agreements, it does not terminate existing contracts between ICE, state and local governments, regional jails or sheriffs’ offices. Nor does it prohibit new agreements at the local level.
All state and local agreements “remain in force until terminated” by one or both parties, a new Legal Aid Justice Center analysis found. There has been no evidence to date that any existing contracts between ICE and state or local law enforcement have been ended as a result of the governor’s action.
The report details how dozens of agencies across Virginia — including state agencies and regional jails — have contracted with ICE to perform duties that may exceed their authority or conflict with state law and the Virginia Constitution.
The analysis further found that at least 223 state and local personnel have been nominated to participate in 287(g) agreements, including two school resource officers and a behavioral health advocate. One facility — the Riverside Regional Jail in Prince George County — receives more than half of its revenue from holding people for ICE.
“Those local law enforcement agencies with 287(g) agreements now have a massive financial incentive to abandon their mission to protect communities in favor of terrorizing immigrant populations,” said Alex Kornya, LAJC’s director of litigation. 
“Contracts with ICE, often shrouded in secrecy, are not only a misuse of time and resources, but they also open these agencies up to significant liability, liability that Virginia taxpayers will ultimately pay.”
LAJC said many of the agreements were negotiated quietly, with agencies declining to provide information in response to public records requests — in some cases saying ICE instructed them not to respond.
According to ICE’s own website, there are currently at least 32 active 287(g) agreements in Virginia involving the state and local governments, and correctional facilities. Five are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law enforcement.
ICE did not respond to a request for comment from The Mercury.
 Fear, trust and public safety

Civil rights groups, including LAJC, say the impact of these agreements extends beyond immigration enforcement, undermining trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement.
“Governor Spanberger’s action to rescind EO 47 on her first day was an important step, as these contracts do nothing to make people safer,” said Rohmah Javed, legal director of LAJC’s Immigrant Justice Program, adding that immigrant communities across the state are terrified.
“These agreements erode trust, making it much less likely immigrants will seek out needed services, report crimes witnessed or crimes they have experienced as victims, or participate in their communities,” Javed said. “But we need to see immediate action at both the state and local levels to officially end these abusive agreements.”
The ACLU of Virginia called the order a first step toward ensuring state law enforcement is not used for federal immigration enforcement, while cautioning that existing contracts and federal authority remain unchanged.
“Governor Spanberger’s executive order recognizes that blurring the line between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration agents not only diverts Virginia resources away from public safety priorities, but erodes public trust by terrorizing communities and breaking apart families,” ACLU of Virginia Executive Director Mary Bauer said.
 Republicans warn repeal of ICE order threatens public safety

Virginia GOP leaders, meanwhile, sharply criticized Spanberger’s decision, arguing that rescinding Youngkin’s order weakens cooperation with federal authorities and threatens public safety.
Youngkin himself told The Mercury in an interview earlier this month that rescinding his Executive Order 47 would be “a huge mistake,” calling it a necessary tool for combating violent crime and gang activity, particularly in Northern Virginia.
“That partnership has made Virginia safer. We arrested the number-three guy in MS-13; the number three guy in MS-13 was just living in Virginia that otherwise would have never been arrested,” Youngkin said.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, former Attorney General Jason Miyares called Spanberger’s move “a disaster for the public safety” of the commonwealth. “Mark my words, there will be Virginians who will be robbed, raped and murdered as a result of this anti public safety executive order. No one should be surprised.”
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, also warned that ending mandated cooperation with ICE could lead to increased crime. 
“Folks need to be able to walk their street at night without fear of being either shot or kidnapped or raped. It’s the wrong way to move with public safety in Virginia,” Kilgore said. When Governor Youngkin had the agreement, we were able to catch all those MS-13 gang members up in Northern Virginia. If we’re not cooperating with ICE, folks are going to get harmed in Virginia.”
However, federal data show that immigrants without criminal records now make up the largest share of people held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, despite repeated assertions by some political leaders that enforcement is focused primarily on violent offenders.
According to ICE’s own figures, roughly 73% of those in detention as of late 2025 had no criminal conviction, and only a small fraction were held for violent offenses — many others had only minor or civil immigration offenses. 
In Virginia, too, officials have not substantiated claims about the criminal histories of people rounded up by the state’s task force. Last summer, Youngkin claimed his administration had arrested more than 2,500 immigrants who were “violent criminals,” but Miyares at the time declined to provide evidence that those individuals were in fact violent offenders when pressed by The Mercury.

 Local leaders respond

In Richmond, Mayor Danny Avula — the city’s first immigrant mayor — issued a statement addressing community concerns following reports of ICE activity in the region, including recent activity in Chesterfield County and Petersburg.
“I understand there is tremendous fear in the community right now,” Avula said. “Fear in completing everyday tasks, such as showing up for work, taking your children to school, or buying groceries, and I want you to know I hear you.”
Avula emphasized that Richmond does not coordinate with ICE on deportation activities and that the Richmond Police Department has not entered into a 287(g) agreement.
“Our officers are here to focus on their core mission: community policing, protecting all neighborhoods, and reducing crime,” Avula said, urging residents to call 911 if they need law enforcement assistance.
“I reject any approach that creates fear, confusion, or division,” he added. “Those tactics undermine public safety and erode trust, making our communities less safe, not more secure.”
Meanwhile, immigration enforcement concerns intensified last week after Hanover County officials confirmed receiving a letter from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security outlining plans to purchase and operate an ICE processing facility in a warehouse on Lakeridge Parkway.
County officials said the project was not initiated by Hanover and that the county has 30 days to respond. The Board of Supervisors had not convened to discuss the proposal as of Thursday and is expected to address the matter at its Jan. 28 meeting.
Virginia currently has two major long-term ICE detention centers — the Farmville Detention Center and the Caroline Detention Facility — along with regional jails that hold detainees under contract, including the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail. 
Advocacy groups say any expansion of processing or detention capacity could deepen fear in surrounding communities.
 A broader political test

The debate over federal immigration enforcement underscores a broader challenge for Democratic governors in states where ICE activity remains governed largely by federal authority and locally negotiated contracts.
In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz publicly condemned a federal immigration operation in Minneapolis that sparked widespread protest after a federal agent fatally shot a 37-year old woman through her car window earlier this month. Following the killing, Walz demanded that the state must play a role in the investigation of the incident. 
Coverage of the fallout has highlighted the limited tools Democratic governors have to rein in enforcement carried out independently by ICE or through local arrangements.
Similar tensions have surfaced in Illinois and Massachusetts, where Democratic governors back sanctuary-style policies but continue to face criticism when ICE makes arrests in jails and courthouses governed by local practices rather than state law. 
In Illinois, confusion over the state’s TRUST Act has left sheriffs and the governor caught between immigrant advocates and federal officials. In Massachusetts, renewed attention to ICE courthouse arrests has put Gov. Maura Healey under pressure to respond to enforcement decisions she does not control. 
Against that backdrop, Spanberger has emphasized that the stakes in Virginia are about trust — particularly whether immigration enforcement policies discourage people from calling police when they need help. 
“Ultimately, how we will determine how Virginia proceeds is that — and I say this as someone who grew up in a law enforcement family and began my career in law enforcement — the idea that any community member would be afraid of calling police in a time of need, if there’s an emergency in their home, is a tragedy in and of itself,” Spanberger said.

(Photo by Bill Hinton/Getty Images)A proposal to create a volunteer cybersecurity incident response team, investigating and troubleshooting threats targeting digital systems around the commonwealth, will be considered again in this year’s General Assembly session. 
The legislation, carried by Del. Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach, would authorize the Virginia Information Technologies Agency to select people to serve as Virginia Cyber Civilian Corps volunteers and corps advisors, and to deploy such volunteers across the commonwealth to provide rapid-response assistance under the direction of VITA upon request from a client, or government agency, affected by a cybersecurity incident. 
The proposal would also create an advisory board within VITA to review and make recommendations regarding the creation and administration of the corps.
This comes as public data suggests cyber attacks are increasing. In many cases, reporting lags and transparency vary due to reputational or security concerns.
“The problem today is that localities are ‘soft targets’ these days,” said Tijay Chung, an associate professor in the computer science department at Virginia Tech. “Hackers have shifted (their) focus from hard and corporate targets to schools, hospitals or municipalities.”
He said House Bill 83 is a smart idea and that hackers are aware that local governments don’t have the budgets for a state-of-the-art security system or dedicated 24/7 monitoring teams.  
“That’s why these days hackers, in my opinion, think that (attacking) localities are easy targets —  low risk, high reward,” Chung added.
In 2024, Feggans introduced a similar proposal, which cleared the General Assembly during his first term. However, former Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the bill. Youngkin believed creating a civilian cybersecurity corps is premature, costly and legally unclear under Virginia’s current cybersecurity setup.
According to the Department of Planning and Budget, an estimated $410,000 is projected for the Virginia Information Technology Agency to create and fund an advisory board for the Virginia Cyber Civilian Corps. Funds would also be allocated to the Virginia State Police for fingerprinting volunteers.
Feggans’ interest in introducing the legislation stems from his time as a cybersecurity intern for former Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s administration and their research on potential legislation. He also saw the success of similar proposals in other states like Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. 
“This wasn’t just something that came up out of the blue,” Feggans said at the start of the General Assembly session. “It’s a model showing that we can increase our cybersecurity resources without adding a large bill to the state. We’ve seen cyber attacks happen in Virginia, and we just need to continue to increase our intellectual abilities to be able to assist in that, and this is my way to address our cybersecurity resources within the state.”
In December, Campbell County was targeted by a cyberattack on its emergency notification system, OnSolve CodeRed, for weather and emergency alerts. 
The county says the system has been decommissioned. An initial investigation found that an organized cybercriminal group damaged the CodeRED platform. The group may have removed subscriber data and posted some of it online.
Chung said lawmakers will need to consider vetting volunteer experts in their implementation plan.
Chung said that having a certification does not necessarily mean you can stop an active ransomware attack.
“You really have to have real experience. Conversely, some of the best white hat hackers may not have a formal degree. VITA needs to balance bureaucracy with actual technical capability.”
If Feggans’ bill is to have any success in passing to the Senate, it will have to clear the House of Delegates before crossover on Feb. 18. Gov. Abigail Spanberger would be responsible for signing the legislation.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)Incarcerated people in Virginia can contact their friends and family by phone call or a special email service for prisons, but those who previously served time say in-person visits helped them keep morale high and incentivized good behavior.
Former and current inmates and criminal justice advocates are calling for clearer visitation standards in Virginia facilities, a challenge a new legislative measure is designed to address.
House Bill 173 by Del. Bonita Anthony, D-Norfolk, would require that the Virginia Department of Corrections provide extended visitation access for long-distance travelers who live at least 150 miles outside of the correctional facility, minors under 18 years old, and infrequent visitors who have not been to see their loved one in more than 90 days. Each visit for these types of guests would be at least two hours, unless the visitor or inmate requests to shorten it. 
Before the standards become applied broadly to VADOC, the bill stipulates that the department conduct pilot programs of the revised visitation rules at three or more prisons with different security levels to evaluate the staffing and safety impacts. This will help the department sort through how to best implement the new visitation standards. 
The bill also outlines how visitation privileges could only be suspended for conduct occurring during the visitation that “presents a direct and substantial threat to the physical safety of participants or the security of the correctional facility.”
Finally, it would create an appeal process for suspension of visitation rights and would require VADOC to collect and publish related data in an annual report to state lawmakers. 
Christine Via, whose husband Blake was previously incarcerated at Dilwyn Correctional Center, said she has been turned away when trying to visit him due to her attire, despite her attempts to follow the visitation rules and clothing policy. 
VADOC policy outlines that clothing must cover people from neck to kneecap, must not contain “inappropriate language or graphics,” watches and other wearable technology are prohibited, and that administrative duty officers “will make the final decision” on whether or not someone is allowed into the visitor room.
No matter what she wore, Christine said occasionally authorities at the center told her she needed to change for security reasons.
So, she’d “run to the nearest store and get something because I don’t want to skip my visit,” she said.
After several such interactions, she said she didn’t always bring the couple’s young son along to the facility, an hour and a half from their home, concerned that he would “get his hopes up,” only to not see his father. 
Another time, Blake said his visitation privileges were at risk of being revoked because apparently he and Christine shared too long of a kiss. 
“It’s inconsistent with treatment between (correctional officers’) shifts,” Blake said, adding that Anthony’s bill could help create consistent standards.
Humanization Project co-founder Taj Mahon-Haft also supports the bill. The organization, spearheaded by formerly incarcerated people like himself, advocates to the state legislature on behalf of bills like Anthony’s. 
During Mahon-Haft’s incarceration his mother and his now-wife were two of the people he was in touch with most, each leaning on the other for emotional support. With his mother living in New Mexico, she saved up money and took time off work to visit at least twice a year. This entailed paying for flights, a hotel and a rental car. 
In late 2021, as COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were easing up, Mahon-Haft said he’d filled out the required documentation to arrange for his mother to visit him. She was told to leave the prison after just an hour, he said, despite the waiting room being empty. 
It was the last time she visited him before he was released. 
“She couldn’t put herself through that again,” he said. “She’d spent thousands of dollars, come thousands of miles and wasted five days of her PTO.”
He and the Vias feel that the treatment by prison staff has “basically discouraged away visits” at times. 
Anthony’s bill must work its way through various committees before it may clear both chambers of the legislature and ultimately face Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s final approval, amendments or rejection.

(Photo by Vicki Jauron, Babylon and Beyond Photography via Getty Images) Menhaden, the controversial oily fish, are making waves early in the General Assembly legislative session.
Three bills have been filed that would curb menhaden catches by the only reduction fishery allowed in the Chesapeake Bay and to study the population, which some conservation groups have said is declining in the Bay and spurring suffering among other species. 
Ocean Harvesters, which contracts with Omega Protein, is a purse seine reduction fishery in Reedville, Virginia. They are the only reduction fishery allowed in the Bay, as surrounding states have banned that kind of industrial scale fishing. They frequently are blamed for the challenges posed to the menhaden population within the Bay.
Conservationists have been sounding the alarm over starving osprey populations, which researchers use as a proxy for menhaden as they are a key part of the birds’ diets. 
Maryland members of the Atlantic Menhaden Management Board have also claimed that fewer menhaden have been able to travel up to their shores for fishermen to harvest in years past, a point that Ocean Harvesters has fiercely denied and said data does not support.
Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, sponsored House Bill 1048 that would halt all purse seine fishing of menhaden in the Virginia portion of the Chesapeake Bay until it can be scientifically proven that the fishery does not negatively impact other fisheries or species that depend on the forage fish to survive.
Ocean Harvesters said that broad language could mean the fishery shutters permanently.
“The cost would be real and immediate in the Northern Neck, where these measures threaten hundreds of jobs for fishermen and plant workers, along with paychecks, benefits, and health insurance in a rural region with few comparable, full-benefit alternatives,” Ocean Harvesters said. “These bills would disproportionately hit a largely minority, union workforce and punish working families while ignoring the science-based management already in place.”
Carr’s other bill, HB 1049, would implement quota periods so that the amount the fishery is allowed to harvest, which is already limited by a specific cap of 51,000 metric tons, would be spaced out over certain times so that the menhaden could potentially move through the Bay. 
The proposal is similar to a suggestion by the Maryland representative in the menhaden management board, which opted to restrict menhaden harvests by 20% along the entire East Coast.
“HB 1049 goes further than the Maryland delegation proposal by restricting rollover of unused quota between periods and layering on an observer requirement for a portion of trips, which are additional operational burdens without a clear conservation payoff,” Ocean Harvesters said.
Carr could not be reached for comment on her bills.
The General Assembly has attempted and failed to pass legislation in the past to conduct a Bay- specific study on the menhaden populations. There’s another attempt on the docket this year.
Sen. David Marsden, D-Fairfax, proposed Senate Bill 474 to establish the Atlantic Menhaden Research Fund to be used by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science to conduct the menhaden population study and report to the General Assembly each year.
“Directly and indirectly, menhaden are essential to the livelihoods of countless Virginia small businesses, families, and communities. Responsibly managing the fishery protects the menhaden industry’s own workers, who have the most to lose if the fishery collapses,” said Will Poston, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation forage campaign manager.
The three bills have not yet come up for hearings in the General Assembly.

More people in the legal field are using AI to automate repetitive tasks and save time, but hallucinations have led to fake cases and false information in legal documents. (Photo by Madyson Fitzgerald/Stateline)Last spring, Illinois county judge Jeffrey Goffinet noticed something startling: A legal brief filed in his courtroom cited a case that did not exist.
Goffinet, an associate judge in Williamson County, looked through two legal research systems and then headed to the courthouse library — a place he hadn’t visited in years — to consult the book that purportedly listed the case. The case wasn’t in it.
The fake case, generated by artificial intelligence, came across Goffinet’s desk just a few months after the Illinois Supreme Court’s policy on the use of AI in the courts took effect. Goffinet co-chaired a task force that informed that policy, which allows the use of AI as long as it complies with existing legal and ethical standards.
“People are going to use [AI], and the courts are not going to be able to be a dam across a river that’s already flowing at flood capacity,” Goffinet said. “We have to learn how to coexist with it.”
As more false quotes, fake court cases and incorrect information appear in legal documents generated by AI, state bar associations, state court systems and national law organizations are issuing guidance on its use in the legal field. A handful of states are considering or enacting legislation to address the issue, and many courts and professional associations are focused on education for attorneys.
Federal judge mulls sanctions for attorneys who used AI in court filing

From divorce cases to discrimination lawsuits, AI-generated fake content can cause evidence to be dismissed and motions to be denied.
While some states urge attorneys to lean on existing guidance about accuracy and transparency, the new policies address AI concerns related to confidentiality, competency and costs. Most policies and opinions encourage attorneys to educate themselves and to use proprietary AI tools that prevent sensitive data from being entered into open source systems. Since AI tools could also increase efficiency, several policies advise attorneys to charge less if they spend less time on cases.
Some states, such as Ohio, also ban the use of artificial intelligence for certain legal tasks. In Ohio, courts are prohibited from using AI to translate legal forms, court orders and similar content that may affect the outcome of a case.
Several states have also advised legal professionals to adhere to the American Bar Association’s formal opinion of ethical AI use in law.
Artificial intelligence can help attorneys and law firms by automating administrative tasks, analyzing contracts and organizing documents. Generative AI can also be used to draft legal documents, including court briefs. Experts say the use of AI productivity tools can save legal professionals time and reduce the risk of human error in everyday tasks.
But law professionals nationwide have faced fines and license suspensions, among other consequences, for submitting legal documents citing false quotes, cases or information.
Many legal professionals are likely to not notice instances in which an AI system is “hallucinating,” or confidently making statements that are not true, said Rabihah Butler, the manager for enterprise content for Risk, Fraud and Government at the Thomson Reuters Institute. The institute is a research subsidiary of the Thomson Reuters company, which sells an AI system meant to help lawyers.










AI has such confidence, and it can appear so polished, that if you're not paying attention and doing your due diligence, the hallucination is being treated as a factual piece of information.

Courts and law organizations will need to consider education, sanctions and punitive actions to ensure law professionals are using AI appropriately, Butler said.
“AI has such confidence, and it can appear so polished, that if you’re not paying attention and doing your due diligence, the hallucination is being treated as a factual piece of information,” she said.
Since the beginning of 2025, there have been 518 documented cases in which generative AI produced hallucinated content used in U.S. courts, according to a database by Damien Charlotin, a senior research fellow at the HEC Paris business school.
“So far, if we’re looking at the institutional response, there’s not a lot because people are not very sure how to handle this kind of issue,” Charlotin said. “Everyone is aware that some lawyers are using artificial intelligence in their day-to-day work. Most people are aware that the technology is not very mature. But it’s still hard to prevent a mistake.”
State guidance
As of Jan. 23, state bar associations or similar entities have issued formal guidance on the use of AI in at least 10 states and the District of Columbia, typically in the form of an ethics opinion. Those aren’t enforceable as law, but spell out proper conduct.
In February, for example, the Professional Ethics Committee for the State Bar of Texas issued an ethics opinion that outlines issues that may arise from law professionals using AI. Texas lawyers should have a basic understanding of generative AI tools and guardrails to protect client confidentiality, it said. They should also verify any content generated by AI and refrain from charging clients for the time saved by using AI tools.
Legal professionals must be aware of their own competency with AI tools, said Brad Johnson, the executive director of the Texas Center for Legal Ethics.
“A really important takeaway from the opinion is that if a lawyer is considering using a generative AI tool in the practice of law, the lawyer has to have a reasonable and current understanding of the technology because only then can a lawyer really evaluate the risks that are associated with it,” he said.
Court systems in at least 11 states — Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia — have established policies or issued rules of conduct regarding AI use by law professionals.
Illinois, for instance, allows lawyers to use artificial intelligence and does not require disclosure. The policy also emphasizes that judges will ultimately be responsible for their decisions, regardless of “technological advancements.”
“The task force wanted to emphasize that as judges, what we bring to the table is our humanity,” said Goffinet, the associate judge. “And we cannot abdicate our humanity in favor of an AI-generated decision or opinion.”
Former lawyer seeks reinstatement after sanctions, arrest and contempt findings

Some state lawmakers have tried to address the issue through legislation. Last year, Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed a measure that requires attorneys to use “reasonable diligence” to verify the authenticity of evidence, including content generated by artificial intelligence. The law also allows parties in civil cases to raise concerns about the admissibility of evidence if they suspect it was generated or altered by artificial intelligence.
California Democratic state Sen. Tom Umberg also introduced legislation last year that would require attorneys to ensure confidential information is not entered into a public generative AI system. The measure, which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also would require attorneys to ensure that reasonable steps are taken to verify the accuracy of generative AI material.
Attorney education
It’s also important for state bar associations and law schools to provide education on artificial intelligence, said Michael Hensley, a counsel at FBT Gibbons and an advocate for the safe use of AI in California courts. AI has the ability to reduce research time just like online legal research systems, but it requires training, he said.
“I would hope the state bar would have training for this,” Hensley said. “And I think it’s absolutely imperative that law schools have a session on AI.”
In a Bloomberg Law survey conducted last spring, 51% of the more than 750 respondents said their law firms purchased or invested in generative artificial intelligence tools. Another 21% said they planned to purchase AI tools within the next year. Attorneys reported using generative AI for general legal research, drafting communications, summarizing legal narratives, reviewing legal documents and other work.
Of the law firms that were not using generative AI, attorneys cited incorrect or unreliable output, ethical issues, security risks and data privacy as the top reasons.
While attorneys and law firms have become more comfortable with AI tools, courts have been more apprehensive, said Diane Robinson, a principal court research associate at the National Center for State Courts. Robinson is also project director at the Thomson Reuters Institute/NCSC AI Policy Consortium for Law and Courts, an association of legal practitioners and researchers developing guidance and resources for the use of AI in courts.
AI has the potential to improve case processing and can allow people needing legal advice to find information by using AI chatbots, she said. But, she added, courts are still struggling with evidence altered by AI and briefs littered with hallucinations.
“Fake evidence is nothing new,” Robinson said. “People have been altering photographs as long as there were photographs. But with AI, the ability to create videos, audio and pictures has become very easy, and courts are really struggling with it.”
Charlotin, of HEC Paris, said most courts and professional associations will continue to focus on education right now.
“You cannot prevent a mistake just by telling people, ‘Don’t make a mistake,’” Charlotin said. “That doesn’t work. It’s more about setting up processes to make people aware of it, then they can set up processes to work on dealing with it.”

Here, a cemetery in Henniker. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Rep. Jessica LaMontagne became interested in natural funerals after witnessing a loved one’s home burial in Vermont.
“I was really quite moved by the experience,” she said Thursday, Jan. 23, addressing the House Committee on Executive Departments and Administration. 
The experience set LaMontagne, a Dover Democrat, down a path of learning about alternative funerals. Under certain circumstances, natural burials, in which a person’s body is interred without chemical embalming, are permitted in New Hampshire, she found. But some other natural funeral practices are not currently legal for practice in-state.
One of those methods is “natural organic reduction,” sometimes called “human composting.” In this process, a person’s body is placed in a specialized container and surrounded with plant matter, like hay and wood chips. With assistance from microbes, warmth, and movement, the body is aided in breaking down into nutrient-rich organic material, similar to compost or soil, over a period of weeks or months.
House Bill 1457, which LaMontagne sponsored, would legalize natural organic reduction in New Hampshire and lay out guidelines for regulation of the practice, mirroring state regulation of cremation and cremation facilities.
This session marks the third time such legislation has been introduced. LaMontagne first introduced House Bill 1324, which would have legalized natural organic reduction, in 2024; that bill was sent for interim study, where it died in committee. Sen. Daniel Innis, a Bradford Republican, introduced a similar measure as Senate Bill 53 in 2025 that was also left in interim study. 
Innis is a co-sponsor of this year’s bill, along with Nashua Democratic Rep. William Darby, Stratham Democratic Rep. Allison Knab, Dover Democratic Sen. David Watters, and Manchester Republican Sen. Keith Murphy.  
“We’ve joined forces, and hopefully three times will be the charm, because natural organic reduction is growing across the country,” LaMontagne said.
Rep. Jessica LaMontagne, a Dover Democrat, presents a bill to legalize organic reduction of human remains before the House Committee on Executive Departments and Administration on Thursday, Jan. 22. People may choose natural organic reduction for the similar reasons they would choose cremation, LaMontagne said. “They want to just go back: ashes to ashes, dust to dust. This is earth to earth, a more ephemeral and ecological way.” (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
The practice was first legalized in Washington State in 2019, and 13 other states have since followed suit, including Vermont and Maine. A bill to legalize the practice in Massachusetts is currently before the state legislature. 
Some companies will transport deceased individuals out of states where natural organic reduction is illegal to undergo the process elsewhere. But legalizing the method in-state would ease that process for New Hampshire families and support local funeral providers, said LaMontagne.
About 61.4% of Americans are interested in exploring “green” funeral options, according to a 2025 estimate from the National Funeral Directors Association. Besides natural organic disposition is the low-emission practice of liquid cremation, or “aquamation,” which some lawmakers attempted to legalize in New Hampshire in 2013; the measure was ultimately voted down.
Despite widespread interest in alternatives, traditional cremation and burial remain the two major paths for disposition chosen by most people nationwide. Flame cremation is most common, with about 63.4% of people choosing that option in 2025, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. In New Hampshire, nearly 80% choose cremation.
Cremation is less land-intensive than traditional burial and less expensive. Opting for a burial typically adds about $2,000 to the cost of a funeral, according to the National Funeral Directors’ Association, which estimated the median cost of a funeral with burial in the United States at around $8,300 in 2025.
“I think many people choose (cremation) as a more ephemeral means of leaving this world, not to claim a piece of Earth forever in a cemetery,” LaMontagne said. 
But, she said, there are also some environmental drawbacks to cremation. It is energy-intensive and typically uses fossil fuels, LaMontagne said, and it generates particulate air pollution. The resulting ashes also contain large amounts of salt and other inorganic material, which can be harmful to plants and animals.
LaMontagne views natural organic reduction as a solution to some of those issues. The soil-like remains that are produced through the process are safe for plants, and families may confidently use them to plant a tree or scatter on a forest floor, she said.
The variety of possible destinations for reduced remains, however, was one topic of concern at the Thursday hearing. The process produces a large volume of material, about one cubic yard, according to LaMontagne.

That could pose a challenge for funeral directors and others who provide the reduction service, said David Grant, president of the New Hampshire Funeral Directors Association. Families may not want to take the material, unsure where to put it, he said.
Others wondered how the provision forbidding the use of the soil on crops would be enforced.
Bob Dunn, director of public policy for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester, cited dignity and tradition in his testimony opposing the bill.
Dunn said the church viewed reduction as an undignified treatment for the human body. The production and possible use of compost-like soil, he said, was also problematic.
“That process … is something that reduces human remains to a utilitarian end. If we look at the human body as something that can be treated in the utilitarian way, then that sends the message that living people can be looked at in a utilitarian way as well,” he said.
The Catholic Church supports cremation, Dunn said, adding that he viewed natural organic reduction as different from cremation in its production of usable soil and its novelty.
Darby said he would be personally interested in the process in order to have a “green burial” without converting a portion of his property into a cemetery. 
The committee did not take action on the bill, short-titled the “Live Free and Die Free Act”. Members will consider whether to recommend it for passage at a future session.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hennikercemetery-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 05:57:44.161149

Republish photo only with original article.)While redistricting reform might not be on the ballot again this election season, the people who bring about initiatives and constitutional amendments aren’t sitting on their hands. The result of the 2024 campaign informed how advocacy leaders are moving forward, they say.
“I actually think right now is a critically important time for any future redistricting initiative, to keep talking about these issues, and to keep linking this problem to all the other problems around the country,” said Collin Marozzi, advocacy director for the ACLU of Ohio.
Ballot initiatives serve as an important part of making governmental change, one that many around the state see as one of the only ways, currently, to bring about change on which a Republican supermajority won’t budge, like reproductive rights or marijuana.
While an initiated statute on marijuana succeeded (though the legislative success is still to be determined), and reproductive rights were solidly approved to enter the Ohio Constitution, the most recent pass at redistricting reform to change to a citizen-run method rather than one run by elected officials didn’t fare as well.
While there were lots of reasons given on the defeat of the issue, the concept of bringing up a renewed effort amid a heavily populated and highly fundraised 2026 election doesn’t strike the right chord with participants in the previous effort.
“Though our resolve to bring fair maps and a transparent process to Ohio has not wavered, we are considering the strategic and political hurdles that stand in the way of a successful ballot campaign,” Marozzi told the Capital Journal.
Many things go into the process of putting a constitutional amendment or other measure on the ballot. First comes the motivation to circumvent the legislature if an issue hasn’t risen to the level advocates think it should, often after years of attempting to persuade lawmakers.
“Unfortunately, there are times that the legislature will not move and so the ability of every day Ohioans to pull out their clipboards and get something on the ballot is transformational,” said Jen Miller, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio.
Often times, as Ohio has seen with property tax debate, just the shadow of an impending ballot measure could be enough to bring about at least some action with elected officials.

  The language of change 
When the needle doesn’t move, initiative leaders get to work, with the help of policy and legal experts, to put together the language that will frame the issue.
The idea has to be easy for voters to digest, but also legally enforceable, and able to extend change after the measure is approved by voters.
“We can spend all the money in the world on advertisements, in terms of what they see on TV, or what they see on their phones, but at the end of the day, the last thing that they see before they vote is that ballot language,” said Jeff Dieringer, political and research strategist with the labor union SEIU 1199. “And more times than not, that is going to be the determining factor of whether they check yes or no.”
It doesn’t help that issues that have failed recently statistically fare worse on future attempts, and a change to the constitution is going to start with a higher level scrutiny before the issue has even hit the table.
“If an issue is highly contested, voters are most likely to say no,” said Catherine Turcer, head of voting rights organization Common Cause Ohio. “Voters who aren’t sure are likely to say no.”
The 2023 reproductive rights amendment is one advocates point to as a good example of being easily understood, unlike the complicated and lengthy changes in the redistricting proposal.
“That was instructive, in that it was short, but is also tangibly understandable to the public,” Miller said. “(Voters) knew the rights we had before Roe v. Wade was gutted, and that this preserved those rights.”
Even with the right collection of words, whether or not the language remains the same from the advocates’ table to the official ballot is the source of struggle nowadays.
“Now we have to factor in … kind of the institutional role, and what is the worst ballot language that could be presented,” Marozzi said.
The Ohio Ballot Board, which has final say on what amendments end up on Ohio ballots, received a lot of flack for the changes they made to the redistricting reform amendment in 2024, in which they inserted language saying the redistricting commission would be “required to gerrymander” maps that establish the voting districts in the state.
The Ohio Supreme Court upheld most of the changes, including that particular change, to the surprise of many.

“The language was so Orwelllian that I couldn’t imagine they would go along with it,” Turcer said.
But because of the success they saw within elected official-led institutions like the Ohio Ballot Board, even with moves they say were misleading and deliberately one-sided, those leading the charge for change see the need for a more comprehensive change.
“We’re not necessarily ripe for big systemic change at the beginning of 2026,” Turcer said. “But we deserve to participate in a democracy that is not rigged by things like gerrymandered district lines and ballot board shenanigans.”
While changing those who are in office could be a step forward, Turcer said the environment for change in Ohio has grown to include more than just individual elected officials.
“Lying has now become part of the process, and changing the guard could disrupt the system for a few years,” Turcer said. “But that doesn’t mean that one side or the other couldn’t just go back to dirty deeds fairly easily, because one political party is in power.”
  Then comes the money 
The art of bringing together a battalion of volunteers to gather the more than 400,000 signatures over more than 40 counties needed to even get the measure in the hands of those who might approve the language has seen its own changes over the years.
“You’re obviously not just submitting that amount, usually the goal is to aim for about double that,” Dieringer said.
Volunteers usually aren’t enough these days, advocates say, and money needs to go to entities who verify the signatures.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a ballot measure that was wholly volunteer based that successfully was able to qualify (for the ballot),” Dieringer said. “It’s just not possible, given the timeline that you’re doing.”

Like it or not, money is a driver for ballot initiatives to receive signatures, for information to make it in front of the eyes of voters, and in the end, for voters to make their decision.
“The language isn’t enough, and it’s not enough just to think about ‘can you collect enough signatures in time,’” Turcer said. “It’s not enough just to get on the ballot, you need to actually get people to vote for it.”
Getting across the finish line means marketing in the media, even through Indiana and West Virginia where markets overlap with Ohio. Radio campaigns work better in rural areas like Southeast Ohio, where broadband isn’t as reliable as in other areas. Social media campaigns are rampant now, and supporters and opponents alike need to get creative in how they go about pushing their view.
“Ohio is incredibly expensive (for elections), you have a very large population, and you have multiple media markets,” Marozzi said. “You really have to do a full landscape analysis to see where and how you’re going to raise the necessary amount of money.”
Also playing a factor in how advocates persuade donors and voters is whether or not the election could see a big turnout, like in presidential years, or during an off-year with not much in the way of other candidates or issues to attract voters.
“Donors don’t want to give large sums of money to an effort that is a coin flip if it’s going to win or not,” Marozzi said. “But also they don’t want to spend money on communication that’s ineffective.”
For now, Marozzi and other advocates say that means a less-than-favorable path to success for something like redistricting reform. But it doesn’t mean other ways of bringing about change are off the table.
“The League of Women Voters is not going to stop until we have stopped partisan gerrymandering,” Miller said. “But right now we are focused on making sure every Ohioan has what they need to participate freely and fairly in every primary and general election.”
Voters should put their eye toward the future by asking candidates what they will be doing to represent voter interests, and tell the candidates what voters need.
“It does feel like change is in the air, but when we think about politics, we shouldn’t just be thinking about the next election,” Turcer said. “We should think about the ways we can support each other and engage, everything from book clubs to attending public hearings.”
Talking with those in book clubs, and coffee shops, and congregations brings about the idea that there is agreement about what is right and wrong in Ohio, Marozzi said. Conversations happening outside the ballot box are important as voters wait to cast their votes.
“It’s not lost on people that … what (elected officials are) talking about is people’s votes not actually having any impact, and that leaves a bad taste in people’s mouths,” Marozzi said.

(Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A million people talk to ChatGPT about suicide every week. That’s the estimate Open AI released in late October while announcing new safety measures for people in crisis. When a software program becomes the place young people go to say they want to die, we have crossed into dangerous territory. 
AI companies are filling a mental health gap without meeting the safety expectations we require from licensed clinicians. That’s why Rhode Island needs to establish guardrails before more teens are put at risk.
A recent Brown University study examined how large language models like ChatGPT respond when asked to act like therapists. Even when prompted to use evidence-based techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy, the bots studied routinely violated core counseling ethics. In hundreds of test conversations, they offered false reassurance, overvalidated negative thoughts, and failed to recognize suicide language. The researchers ultimately identified 15 categories of serious ethical risks — lapses that, if made by a human counselor, would trigger oversight boards or malpractice liability. 
For chatbots, there is nothing but a disclaimer.
The consequences are no longer hypothetical. In April 2025, 16-year-old Adam Raine died by suicide. His parents didn’t know how much he was struggling until they looked through his phone and found long exchanges he’d had with ChatGPT, according to the testimony of his father Matthew Raine before a Senate subcommittee hearing on the harms of AI chatbots. In those messages, Adam told the chatbot about his suicidal thoughts and plans. But instead of urging him to reach out for trusted help, the bot discouraged him from doing so and even offered to write his suicide note, according to the testimony.










When a software program becomes the place young people go to say they want to die, we have crossed into dangerous territory. 


Adam’s death has drawn national attention to a larger trend: Young people are increasingly turning to chatbots for emotional support. A national survey by Common Sense Media found that 72% of teenagers have used an AI chatbot as a companion, and about one in eight have sought it for mental health concerns. 
It’s not difficult to see why a teen would do so, considering that nearly half of young adults showing symptoms of anxiety or depression received no treatment last year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. To compound the issue, parts of the brain that manage impulse control, emotional regulation, and risk-taking aren’t fully developed until age 25. That developmental gap leaves teenagers especially sensitive to reward and approval, and less able to question what they’re told. The same vulnerabilities that social media companies exploit to make them scroll endlessly works just as well within a chatbot.
AI has become a lifeline for young people seeking help, but its reach has far outpaced regulation. Rhode Island has a chance to lead the country by building the guardrails that national regulators have been slow to implement.
The state already has the right infrastructure to act: Brown’s researchers are helping steer the national conversation on ethics in technology, and the Rhode Island AI task force, created in February 2024, could set the first standards for mental health safety. State lawmakers should require companies to prove their products are safe before teens can use them, the same way we expect new drugs or medical devices to be tested before they’re used by the public. That review should test whether chatbots can recognize harmful phrases and automatically route users to the 988 Lifeline when necessary.
Second, the Rhode Island Department of Health should treat mental health chatbots as a form of health-related service. The state can then require transparency about what happens to the data after conversations end, who can access it, and whether it is used to train future models. Parents, schools, and clinicians cannot protect kids if they have no idea how these tools actually work. Moreover, the Attorney General’s office can use its consumer-protection authority to prohibit AI companies from making unverified therapeutic claims. If an AI tool markets itself as providing guidance or coaching, it should be held to the same standard of truthfulness that we demand from any medical or counseling service.
The question isn’t whether AI will shape the future of mental health care; it already has. My generation learned to navigate adolescence through platforms that were never built with wellbeing in mind, and we cannot repeat that mistake with AI. Rhode Island has the chance to show that states can act faster and with more responsibility than tech giants. By setting clear standards now, lawmakers can ensure that AI remains a support tool, not another witness to a preventable tragedy.
If you are in crisis or need someone to talk to, you can call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 988, chat on 988lifeline.org, or text HOME to 741741 to connect with a crisis counselor.

Getty ImagesGeorgia’s teenagers could soon be doing significantly less scrolling, swiping and tapping on weekdays.
The state Legislature is poised to consider expanding the state’s classroom cell phone ban for elementary and middle schools to high schools. Under the plan passed last year with bipartisan support, school districts had until Jan. 1 to come up with a policy for keeping phones out of student hands during classroom time for kindergarteners through eighth graders, and they have until July to start enforcing it.
Rep. Scott Hilton. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The author of the ban, Peachtree Corners Republican state Rep. Scott Hilton, said he introduced the high school expansion as House Bill 1009 near the start of this year’s legislative session after he said educators gave high marks to what Hilton calls “distraction-free education.”
Districts across the state have implemented their own bans ahead of the state deadline.
“I’ve just been blown away at the positive reaction across the board from all different constituencies, teachers, administrators, parents and even in a lot of cases, students who have experienced a difference and said, ‘Oh, wow, I kind of like this,’” Hilton said.
If the new bill passes the House and Senate and receives Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature, high schools will be required to ban cell phones starting in July 2027.
As of August, 35 states have some form of classroom electronics restriction in place, according to technology news site Techspot. Some states, like Georgia, have banned the devices entirely from the beginning of the day to the end and others have taken more permissive approaches such as allowing phones during lunch or between classes.
Hilton said Georgia is the only state to have started with the lower grades before moving up to high schoolers.
“I think it allowed folks to kind of socialize it, get used to it, and it’s made the transition a lot easier,” he said. “What I love, too, is that a lot of schools have seen the writing on the wall that we were addressing this and have proactively done it themselves already, and so we’ve got some real-world data and anecdotes, not only from across the country, but even inside of Georgia.”
A recent survey from the Professional Association of Georgia Educators found that nearly 72% of teachers in the state say the elementary and middle school ban will improve student learning, and about 71% say high schools should also be cell phone-free zones.
When only high school teachers’ responses were counted, support for a high school ban grew to 83%, the survey found.
School safety
Given the current bill’s popularity with teachers and bipartisan support from last year, the expansion seems likely to find favor in the Legislature this year.
House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, has indicated that he wants to see action on a high school cell phone ban, but speaking to reporters ahead of the start of the session, he added that he also expects lawmakers to consider parents’ and students’ concerns about safety.
Worries about students being unable to contact their families in case of a shooting or other emergency have been a central argument against the cell phone bans, especially in the wake of the deadly 2024 shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder.
Supporters of classroom cell phone bans have emphasized that school emergency plans include procedures for communicating with families and for returning students’ phones to them when it is safe to do so.
House Speaker Jon Burns. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“What we’ve learned from some of the tragic situations we’ve had, like in Barrow County, is that some of that communication certainly is good for the parent to understand that the child is safe, but also interferes with the safety protocols in the school,” Burns said. “So we believe that’s a part of that whole discussion, but you’ll see us move this session, I do believe, to ban cell phones in high schools, because so many jurisdictions around the state have already done that as well, and I think we’re all aware of that.
“I believe that will be something we will certainly have a lively discussion about, but certainly want to respect parents and their feeling of security for their students,” Burns added.
Last week, Apalachee was one of three Barrow County Schools that received called-in threats. The Barrow County Sheriff’s Office placed the entire district on soft lockdown until determining the calls were hoaxes and the schools were safe.
“It raised up a lot of hysteria and a lot of those PTSD triggers and everything because they even brought the choppers out and there was police presence at all the schools, all the schools were locked down and the whole county was pretty shaken up,” said Layla Renee Contreras, an Apalachee High School graduate whose mother and sister were at the school during the 2024 shooting.
Contreras is lead organizer for Change for Chee, an organization pushing for safety improvements in the wake of the shooting.
“I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like when the high schoolers don’t have their cell phones on them,” she said. “Because other places in Georgia, they don’t understand our perspective. We’ve lived through this nightmare already.”
‘The sweet spot’
Speaking to reporters at a media symposium earlier this month, State School Superintendent Richard Woods, who is a Republican, said he supports removing cell phones from high school classrooms because he said they lead to distraction and can harm students’ mental health, but he said he is also cognizant of safety worries.

“I have a student that’s on my student advisory committee, and this young student was at Apalachee,” Woods said. “This student was shot at Apalachee. And I think, listen, there’s a concern that how we deal with this does have an impact. That young person said ‘my phone helped me.’”
“Do I support this? Absolutely,” Woods added, referring to the cell phone bans. “But I think we have to find a sweet spot and not move to the extremes.”
Woods said the specifics of plans should be left to districts. He said instructional time should be completely free of personal electronic devices, but he added that he may be open to districts allowing high schoolers to use their phones during other times like in between class periods.
“We have 181 school districts, over 200 when you think about charter schools, close to 2,400 schools in the state of Georgia,” he said. “So blanket-wise, yes, we need to preserve and put guidelines on how this should be used, but let the districts find out what’s working for them.”
Contreras said she thinks banning phones during classroom time is reasonable, but high school students should learn to be responsible for their own activity before they head off to college or enter the workforce.
“It should be on their person, on their body, in their book bag or something, accessible to them,” she said.
Schools commonly use devices like special locking bags to secure phones during the day or require students to put their devices in a container at the start of the day.
Hilton’s bill would require schools to restrict access entirely from the morning bell until the dismissal bell with the only exceptions being for activities that do not take place on school grounds like field trips, dual enrollment or apprenticeship programs.
“The best practice really is beginning of the day to the end of the day, and the reason being is if you allow for portions of the day, you get right back kind of where we are right now with teachers having to be cell phone police and discipline issues, and we really don’t want that,” Hilton said in a phone call.
Margaret Ciccarelli, an attorney and director of legislative services for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators, said their educator surveys show teachers also favor the so-called “bell to bell” approach, likely because of the challenges intermittent phone use creates during transitions on campus.
“During non-instructional periods like lunch, students are distracted by phones and social media and less likely to engage positively with one another in a face-to-face setting,” she said.
Ciccarelli said surveys also show that educators are expecting parental push back on phone bans – 71% reported anticipating “strong parental or caregiver resistance.”
Hilton said he understands parents wanting to be able to get in touch with their children during the day, but eliminating the distraction of cell phones entirely is best for their education.
“I’ve got kids in school as well, and I catch my own self wanting to text them something,” he said. “I think the parents, in some respects, are part of the challenge, as we’ve got to understand and adapt ourselves to the fact that kids need to be learning and focused on that in school.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)A group called Washington County for Safe Drinking recently filed an ethics complaint with the Ohio Joint Legislative Ethics Committee against Republican Ohio state Sen. Brian Chavez over alleged oil and gas conflicts.
The ethics complaint argues Chavez’s alleged conflicts of interest and voting record as the Ohio Senate Energy Committee Chair shows he has prioritized personal financial gain.

“The complaint alleges Chavez’s conflicts of interest regarding undisclosed business entities and fast-tracking legislation that could benefit these interests,” the complaint said. “When public officials with financial ties to an industry shape laws that directly benefit that industry, it undermines public trust across the entire state.”
Buckeye Environmental Network, Save Ohio Parks, and FaCT Ohio also signed the letter, which calls for an investigation. 
“This is a fundamental crisis of public trust that impacts every Ohioan’s right to safe drinking water and ethical governance,” Washington County for Safe Drinking Water spokesperson Hillary Royster said in a statement. 
Ohio law prohibits Joint Legislative Ethics Committee members or staff from confirming or denying receiving a complaint or allegation, said Ohio Joint Legislative Ethics Committee Executive Director Tony Bledsoe. 
“Therefore, I am unable to provide any further comment,” Bledsoe said in an email. 
When the Capital Journal reached out to Chavez for comment, John Fortney, spokesperson for the Ohio Senate Republicans, responded. 
“These radicalized local groups could care less about ethics, much less safe drinking water,” Fortney said in an email. “This is another baseless, desperate, and hollow attack funded by billionaire California special interests with the single goal of killing the oil and gas industry in Ohio.”
Chavez — who was appointed to the Ohio Senate in December 2023 after Frank Hoagland retired and was elected to a four-year term in 2024 — has many connections to Ohio’s oil and gas industry.
Before becoming a senator, he was a member of the Oil and Gas Commission, served as a trustee for the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, was on the board of the Southeast Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and managed and owned Reno Oil & Gas, Inc.
Chavez resigned as vice president of Heinrich Enterprises, Inc — his wife’s family’s oil and gas business — in 2024, according to Chavez’s 2024 Financial Disclosure Statement.
He was CEO of DeepRock Disposal Solutions, a wastewater disposal company that uses deep-well injections, until 2024. Chavez, however, was listed as a DeepRock Disposal Solutions manager in its 2025 annual report filed with the state of West Virginia, according to the complaint. 
Chavez “does not disclose ownership in DeepRock Disposal Solutions LLC in either his 2023 or his 2024 financial disclosure forms,” according to the complaint. 
“Signing documents as the CEO of DeepRock Disposal Solutions LLC, but failing to disclose employment, or any other interest, with respect to that specific company at any point in the past, is not a standard that the Ohio Ethics Commission should want to set,” the complaint says. 
DeepRock is currently facing litigation in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Brine injected into a DeepRock well migrated underground and erupted to the surface in an abandoned well in Noble County in 2021. DeepRock did not have to pay for clean-up and the state spent about $1.3 million to plug the leak and clean it up. 
Chavez did not disclose his or his immediate family members’ interest in Heinrich Property LLC, Horizon Partners Investments LLC, Funds Protection Investment LLC, Condevco Operating LLC, and DeepRock Disposal Solutions LLC, according to the complaint. 
“Failing to list a single LLC for which you have an interest on a state financial disclosure form is a problem,” the complaint says. “Failing to fully disclose interests in as many as five or even six LLCs … is more than a simple oversight.”
The ethics complaint also alleges Chavez fast-tracked a bill that could financial benefit him. 
Ohio Senate Bill 219 would change the state’s orphan well program by proposing a dedicated fund for plugging orphan wells and streamlining notice requirements before work would begin. An orphan well is an abandoned oil and gas well that has no owner, meaning no one is able to properly plug the well.
It also makes it easier for drillers to get expedited review of projects, limits liability after a well owner sells one of their wells and gets rid of a requirement for drillers to make road-use agreements with local governments. 
The bill was introduced in June by Republican Senator Al Landis, passed the Senate in November, and is now in the Ohio House. 
Chavez Well Service has bid on five orphan well contracts since Chavez became a senator and won one contract worth more that $200,000, according to the complaint.  
“Should Senate Bill 219 become law, the injection well industry will be set to make more money with less oversight,” according to the complaint. “Consequently, Senator Chavez, with both his disclosed and undisclosed interests, could stand to profit from the provisions in Senate Bill 219.” 
Ohio’s Orphan Well Program has plugged approximately 2,300 abandoned wells since its inception in 1977.

(Getty Images)As a family doctor, I have been trained to ask questions, and after years of study and practice, I’ve become pretty good at it.
The question I find myself asking about a recent article published by The Guardian (“‘A bombshell’: Doubt cast on discovery of microplastics throughout human body,” Jan. 13), calling into question the relevance of micro- and nanoplastics to human health is, why? Why would a publication known for its journalistic commitment to robust and factual evidence give oxygen to aspersions on a well-established quorum of scientific consensus?
This is a confounding question in light of the plethora of articles that The Guardian has previously published to the contrary regarding micro- and nanoplastics and human health.
Just two weeks ago, for instance, The Guardian ran an article highlighting the widely agreed upon finding that “burning plastic releases noxious compounds such as dioxins, furans, and heavy metals” (“Household burning of plastic waste in developing world is hidden health threat, study shows,” Jan. 8). This research surveyed 1,000 respondents across 26 countries. The “bombshell” article fails to provide similar significant quantitative objections.
In New Hampshire, where the literal downstream health and environmental impacts of micro- and nanoplastics are readily apparent, The Guardian’s assessment grossly undervalues the lived experience in favor of weak general claims of insufficient scientific rigor.
Included in the long list of noxious compounds associated with the production of plastics are the “forever chemicals” colloquially known as PFAS. These chemicals contaminate air, soil, and water, and have been shown to cause a variety of cancers, thyroid and gastrointestinal disease, and cardiovascular disease. They have been banned because of their toxicity.
The Guardian rightly acknowledges a few facts in its risky article: There is too much plastic in the world, it is a growing problem, it has microscopically made its way into our bodies, and we should probably try to avoid a lot of it.
For reasons that are unclear, The Guardian chose to publish an article of distraction, diverting attention and credibility from this very serious and well-established problem. While the science showing exactly what this means for human health does have room for improvement and growth, it is morally reprehensible to conflate this natural level of uncertainty with a lack of actionable evidence.
The Hippocratic oath is the foundation of medicine, and first doing no harm is the foundation of my care for every patient. So again I ask, why is this fundamental tenet now being challenged?
We all, doctors, health care providers, scientists, journalists, corporate CEOs, and individuals, need to remember this for our own well-being. Part of doing no harm means assuming a conservative approach when it comes to exposure to toxic substances, which we have not always done well.
We don’t put our seatbelts on at the start of a collision, we put them on before we start the car. We should be buckled in for this entire journey in plastics, not years from now when the science is more clear, but now because we are in the car, and we know that there is always a chance of an accident.
We have nothing to lose and everything to gain by putting safety first.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/plasticpollution-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 04:57:16.760364

This story was originally reported by Amanda Becker of The 19th.  Meet Amanda and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Margery Koveleski didn’t know it at the time, but her life’s work began in 2018, when her former pastor asked the mother of six if she could interpret Sunday services for a group of recently arrived Haitians. Church services led to teaching English classes, which led to interpreting at a community health clinic, which led to opening an office in the back of a Haitian grocery store.  There, for nearly five years now, Margery has helped Haitians settle into this midwestern city of 60,000 that became a flashpoint for the country’s immigration debate during the 2024 presidential campaign.
At first, a lot of Margery’s work revolved around setting things up: utilities, cell phones, health care. Then, as President Donald Trump escalated his immigration crackdown to unprecedented levels, her focus shifted to winding things down. Margery is now a lifeline for her Haitian neighbors as they fight to stay in a country where fewer and fewer legal pathways are available to them. Without a last-minute reprieve, the clock has likely run out on many of their American journeys.
Margery has called Springfield home since she moved here about 24 years ago from New York, where she was born and raised. She learned Haitian Creole as a child by translating for her maternal grandmother, who joined them in New York from Haiti. Now, she shares the language of her ancestors — and her calling — with her 27-year-old daughter, Laura Koveleski, who moved home to Ohio from Florida about three years ago.
Margery’s work, done from a desk in a closet-sized storeroom an arm’s length from where her daughter now sits, sometimes demands long hours, produces little income and isn’t the type of job you leave behind when you go home for the day. They know their clients are depending on them, now more than ever, and they’re willing to give them whatever they need most: a ride to court, a sympathetic ear, a call to an employer to negotiate family leave.

Lately, supporting clients as they try to sort out their immigration cases takes up more and more of their time. Margery’s massive desk calendar notes the increasingly frequent all-day trips they make with Haitians to Ohio’s main immigration court in Cleveland, about a three-hour drive. On one such day last autumn, Margery’s alarm went off at 3 a.m. She made her way to the guest bedroom downstairs to make sure Laura was awake. Within the hour, they were out the door to pick up a man on Springfield’s south side, where most of the city’s Haitian immigrants live. A soft rain fell as Laura merged their rental car — picked up the night before, to spare their own from the wear-and-tear — east on I-70, then north on I-71, past the soggy corn and soybean fields that line the interstates most of the way to Cleveland.
Mother and daughter talked quietly as their client caught up on sleep in the back seat. They all knew they were making the journey, which clocks in at least nine hours from pick-up to drop-off, despite near certainty that the man’s asylum claim would be denied. During a prior court appearance, a judge gave him 30 days to produce proof of personal persecution in Haiti, with the type of evidence that is all but impossible to get in a country where armed gangs rule the capital and routine government services barely exist.
It’s a now-familiar predicament for so many in his community.
The man was one of some 330,000 Haitians in the United States under a program known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, which gives people from certain countries in conflict or facing natural disasters the ability to live and work in the United States for a set period of time. He was seeking asylum because barring action from the federal courts, TPS for Haitians ends February 3. Less than two weeks now remain for hundreds of thousands of Haitians to make an impossible choice: go back to an unstable, violent and desperately poor country where they fear they might die; leave and start again in another new country; or slip into the shadows in the United States, unable to work or live freely.
It all has Margery, a no-nonsense nurturer whom many clients call “manman” — Haitian Creole for “mother” — rethinking whether her city and country are the type of places where Haitians should try to put down roots and build lives.
“I went through a process of grief, but I’m now at acceptance,” Margery said.
Margery and Laura arrived back from the trip to Cleveland in the last light of the grey day. On the ride home, their client said he’d likely go to Mexico ahead of the TPS end date; other Haitians have told them they plan to leave for Brazil or Chile. After dropping him off at home, mother and daughter headed to Eat Greek and More, a favorite spot by the reservoir in Springfield’s northeast suburbs. They ordered at the counter, then slid into a booth. Their falafel arrived in plastic baskets lined with red-and-white checkered paper. Now that they’re regulars, the owner often makes eating there all the more enticing by sending over fries or dessert on the house. Margery first tried Greek food with Laura in Cincinnati, and she was thrilled to find such a good option a couple of miles from home. It’s become their go-to place to bring visitors, an introduction to their city that defies preconceived notions about small towns in red states far away from the country’s coasts.
It also serves as yet another reminder of the good that immigration has brought to Springfield at a time when the issue threatens to tear their city — and their country — apart.

Springfield has been on edge since the final months of the 2024 presidential election, when now-President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who was then one of Ohio’s U.S. senators, spread the lie that Haitians in Springfield were eating their neighbors’ pets — a convenient internet fable that bolstered their ticket’s call for mass deportations. Vance grew up just an hour’s drive away, in similarly sized Middletown, Ohio, which did not take the same steps to welcome Haitian immigrants as Springfield did and has also not experienced a recent economic resurgence. When CNN’s Dana Bash confronted Vance about his role spreading the pet-eating lie, he said that it was OK to  “create stories” that drew attention to issues his constituents cared about, like immigration.
But much of the attention directed at  Springfield was negative and laced with violence. Neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups like Blood Tribe and Patriot Front disrupted community events and protested in front of City Hall. Phoned-in bomb threats forced the temporary closure of schools. Local charity leaders helping Haitians were doxxed; business owners employing Haitian workers were threatened. To many in Springfield, it started to feel like their community, where leaders had taken great lengths to help Haitians assimilate by amping up translation services and securing training systems for new drivers, was starting to come apart at the seams.
It wasn’t that Springfield absorbed the estimated 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants that arrived in Ohio’s Clark County in recent years without issue. Though Haitians began immigrating to the area more than a decade ago, their numbers increased during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, when staffing agencies recruited them for jobs that paid as much as $20 an hour — jobs that employers couldn’t seem to fill. The rapid influx stressed local resources, particularly housing, because Haitian workers often rented bedrooms in shared homes and could therefore collectively pay higher rents than many longtime local families. It created some resentment.
Tensions worsened in August 2023 when a Haitian immigrant driving without an Ohio license crashed into a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy on the first day of school. The next year, a jury convicted the driver of aggravated vehicular homicide and involuntary manslaughter. Trump and Vance seized on the tragedy as further evidence that Haitians were criminals, cherry-picking crime statistics to present Springfield as a city under siege. The student’s devastated parents pleaded at city meetings for people to stop invoking their son’s death to justify anti-immigrant hatred.
What the vitriol obscured, according to Margery and many other longtime Springfield residents, were the improvements that followed the most recent wave of Haitian arrivals: formerly boarded-up houses were renovated and filled, employers expanded in the region thanks to a reliable workforce, and small businesses like restaurants and grocery stores opened to serve Haitians nostalgic for home.
Springfield’s Republican mayor worked to dispel the pet-eating myth. Ohio’s GOP governor, Mike DeWine, also tried to turn down the temperature, promising to send more resources to the city where he was born. DeWine was familiar with conditions on the ground in Haiti: He had made dozens of trips there over the years to visit a school named for a daughter who died in a car accident when she was 22; the school was forced to close in early 2024 due to worsening violence. “Haitians are — culturally, my wife, Fran, and I have seen this when we’ve been down in Haiti — education is prized,” DeWine told ABC’s “This Week.” “So when you look at all of these things, people who want to work, people who value their kids, who value education, you know, these are positive influences on our community in Springfield.”
Trump’s second administration has attempted to move up the TPS end date for Haitians (the effort was blocked by the courts) and cut off other avenues for Haitians to obtain different types of legal immigration statuses. Over his first year in office, Haitians have become less visible on Springfield’s streets and foot traffic is down at businesses serving Haitian immigrants, like the grocery store that hosts Margery’s office. As scenes of armed and masked immigration agents breaking down doors in Minneapolis homes began to unfold on smartphone screens in Springfield in recent weeks, Haitians — and their American neighbors — grew more and more afraid. Charities and churches have developed meal-delivery systems so Haitians do not need to leave their houses.

DeWine, who has privately told local charities that his hands are tied when it comes to federal immigration policy, recently warned that if there is no reprieve on TPS, it could jeopardize Springfield’s recent economic upswing, which also boosted fortunes in the larger rural region.
Sometimes, Margery wonders whether it’s time to close up shop.
“Is it worth it to fight to stay in America, now? That’s a question I ask myself,” she said as she and Laura finished their dinner of falafel and owner-proffered fries. “If our government is changing, if more than half of the population is okay with what’s happening, is it really worth it?”
“Changing drastically, so as far as deportations, could be good news, bad news, who knows,” Laura added.
“I used to live in fear of all this mistreatment,” said Margery, “and I’m seeing what’s happening, and because I believe in God, and I know that God is sovereign, if they’re deporting them, who’s to know that is not the best thing?”

Margery’s faith in God is what drew her to Springfield in the first place.
When the Koveleskis were living in New York City, they would travel the country in their motor home, visiting other congregations affiliated with their own conservative, majority-Black Christian church, including one in Springfield. On September 11, 2001, Margery’s husband was at work when two planes flew into the World Trade Center; they couldn’t reach each other for hours. Their fear compelled them to move their young family to safety. A church friend who had hosted them during their Christmastime trips asked, “Why not Springfield?” They moved the next year.
By the time Haitians were arriving in Springfield in earnest, Margery had soured on her church. There was a sex scandal involving a pastor in a neighboring state, and then reports of financial improprieties in another congregation. The church embraced divine healing — the belief that you can recover from illness and injury through the healing power of God without medical intervention — around the same time that Margery needed life-saving caesarean sections to deliver her two youngest children. That, she said, was when she finally “lost the faith.” She now describes herself as spiritual but not religious.
Still, in 2018, when her former pastor asked if she would put differences aside and step up to interpret Sunday services for a group of Haitian congregants, she did not hesitate. She also started teaching them English in the evening.
“I remember the first night they saw snow,” Margery recalled. “They were laughing and opening their mouths, and they were praising God, seeing snow for the first time in their life; this was magical for them.”
One of the students was an older man named Moses. “He had a t-shirt on, and it was snowing, and I said, ‘Moses, you have no coat, aren’t you cold? You should wear a sweater.” She remembered him responding: “No, I’m in America. I’m in America. I’m gonna learn to be content. I’m gonna train my body to be grateful and happy, and so if I’m cold, I’m not going to complain. I’m going to give God thanks because I’m able to be in America, I’m able to work, and I have security, I have a church. What else do I need?”
Margery knew that Moses would nevertheless need a coat to get through Ohio’s winter. She asked the congregation if they could collect cold-weather apparel one Sunday for their Haitian worshippers and was disappointed when church leaders said they would need to hold a special meeting to discuss what seemed like a routine effort, and one they’d done before for other groups in need.
But, she said, God found another way. The principal at her younger son’s school, where she volunteered, overheard her talking about working with the Haitians at church and wrote a no-strings-attached $1,000 check. Margery and her husband used it to buy dozens of coats, gloves and hats, and distributed them to the Haitians after a Sunday service. It was like Christmas arrived early, she said.
Then came her breaking point.
At the end of another church service, when congregants had the opportunity to talk about something God had done in their lives, a debate erupted over whether the Haitians, who were dutifully and enthusiastically paying their tithes, were truly full congregants and able to offer testimony. One American congregant, she said, asked if the Haitians attending church alongside them were “legal.”
When it was Margery’s turn to testify about God’s work in her life, she took the microphone and walked her fellow congregants through passages of the Bible related to persecution and forced migration, and she talked to them about the Underground Railroad.
“I burnt the church with my tongue,” she recalled. “I rebuked the church and the minister, everybody, and I didn’t come back after that.”
But it didn’t take her long to find other ways to continue what had become her own ministry.
For several months, after she and her husband were forced to shutter their high-end furniture store during the pandemic, Margery interpreted for Haitian Creole-speaking patients at a community health care center. Then, a friend from church who knew about her work with the Haitian community called to tell her she’d seen a small grocery store on the city’s south side with a Haitian flag displayed in its window.
Margery wrote down the address, then went to check it out. The owner was a Haitian American with a green card who had recently moved to Springfield from New York, sensing a business opportunity when he heard that Haitian workers were settling in the city. She introduced herself; he said she could help his customers set up their phones and utilities and figure out their dates in immigration court from his grocery.
Margery started out at a little table, set up among the bins of cassava and coolers of Cola Couronne, an amber-colored Haitian soda that tastes like an effervescent fruit punch and is fondly called “Caribbean champagne.” At first, she worked entirely for free. Then, she started accepting small payments to cover supplies like stamps and envelopes. It became clear that her work would require its own designated space — to keep the aisles clear in the grocery store, but also for privacy. Many of Margery’s clients had traveled the harrowing migration route through the Darién Gap, the remote, dense rain forest that links Colombia and Panama. It was not uncommon for their stories to include details of their own sexual assaults or the family members they lost to sickness or injury along the way. They needed a quiet space to unburden themselves. They needed a quiet space to pray.

Now, a slightly larger storage room in the rear of the grocery acts as a waiting area for Margery’s clients until it is their turn to take a seat in the closet-sized storeroom office she shares with Laura. Clients got to know Laura from the small trinkets and jewelry she gifted them, like sheets of earrings from the budget mall shop Claire’s. The gifts helped inject a little joy into the otherwise dreary experience of dealing with the U.S. immigration system.
Laura learned Haitian Creole by listening to clients’ migration stories. Some, she memorialized in paint. One painting, above Margery’s desk, depicts a father and young son holding hands as they face the jungle; the client’s wife and the son’s mother did not survive the trip. The painting above Laura’s own desk shows Haiti’s La Citadelle, a 19th century fortress honoring the successful slave rebellion that led to the country’s independence from France. In the painting, a young boy stands with his mother at the base of the winding, uphill road that leads to Haitian independence, with earthquakes and other obstacles along the way.
“We hear a lot of stories of what it took for people to get here. People who walk from Chile, people who walk from Brazil, people who maybe took a flight from Haiti to Nicaragua, but walk from Nicaragua. All of those people, walking up to the U.S.-Mexico border, hoping to get some sort of permission to enter the country,” Laura said. “During that route, you’re walking through the jungle with your family. A lot of people don’t make it. People fell from mountains. People drown in rivers. If you break a leg, you can’t keep walking, and you can’t have somebody carry you the whole way through, so you hope something will take you out.”

Margery and Laura now work out of their grocery-store office three or four days a week. Each day brings a little bit of everything. A sign in Haitian Creole hanging in the waiting area clarifies what the women can — and cannot  — do for their clients.
Laura translated the words as Margery gently corrected her grammar: “I’m not a lawyer; I’m not an immigration officer; I’m not a U.S.C.I.S. officer; I’m not a judge; I can’t make any decision on your case or process your case; I can’t call or check your status without you; I can’t call immigration without you; I can’t guarantee the results; I can assist you, I can help you with your application, I can write a letter, I can help you get information; I can’t do a miracle, only Jesus can.”

On a chilly day in December, the task at hand was wedding planning. Laura had already gone with the client to weigh in on the dress — intricate lacing, dramatic back, short train — and was now ordering a suit for the bride’s infant son on Amazon. While the client had the money to pay for the suit, she did not have a credit card, so Laura used theirs for the purchase. Once the suit was ordered, they started brainstorming beautiful and free indoor spots in Columbus for wedding photos. Several feet away, another mother met with Margery because she needed help asking her employer for time off work after giving birth.
A couple of months earlier, on a sunny day in October, most of the people who stopped by had questions about a new immigration fee that the Trump administration had announced without explaining how people should pay it. Haitians wanted to comply with the new rule to improve their chances of staying in the country, so they waited in folding chairs against shelves of cassava bread, coconut milk and cases of mango-strawberry juice. Among them was a man with a red folder of documents and a woman bouncing a baby on her knee.
Margery’s cell phone did not stop ringing.
“Alo,” she answered in Haitian Creole. “Yes, you’ll see a Haitian flag in the window,” she said once it was clear that the man on the other end of the line spoke fluent English.
Soon, a master sergeant in his U.S. Army fatigues poked his head into the office to make sure he was in the right place. He held his elderly mother’s purse as she and her husband, dressed in their Sunday best, settled into chairs in the waiting area. His mother and stepfather had called him the night before, he explained, ahead of a court appearance that day because they needed his help interpreting. He drove more than 15 hours overnight from Louisiana to meet them at court in Columbus, only to find out family members could not act as interpreters; the interviews would need to be rescheduled. A lawyer overheard the exchange and shared Margery’s phone number, so the master sergeant, his mother and stepfather got back the car and drove the hour-plus to see her in Springfield.
“They’re frantic right now,” the master sergeant assured Margery, gesturing to the prim and stoic elderly couple sitting outside her office door.
It only took minutes — the master sergeant didn’t even sit down — for them to work out that Margery would assist his mother and stepfather at their rescheduled interview. The master sergeant bought a Couronne, then took his parents to lunch. He would take a short nap before driving back to Louisiana.
“You’re a good son,” Margery said,  then turned back to help the new mother.
Margery and Laura’s work navigating the morass of the U.S. court and immigration systems has only become more essential in recent weeks as the TPS end date looms for Haitians. They said that many are hoping that a federal court intervenes and extends the program. Clients are banking on a judge ruling that since TPS was created to protect people who cannot safely return to their home countries, they cannot be sent back to Haiti — where many of them do want to return someday — until conditions improve.
Margery said she can’t help but think sometimes about one of her favorite musicals, “Fiddler on the Roof.” In it, Tevye is a poor Jewish milkman living in early 1900s Russia. He and his family decide to flee anti-Semitic pogroms in their Jewish village of Anatevka, and the final scene shows them on a ship headed to safety in New York. In Margery’s present-day reimagining, Springfield is Anatevka, Haitians are the persecuted people and the United States is the country they must consider leaving to find safety.
Margery is trying to accept that the country that offered her own parents safe harbor in the 1960s, then the city that offered her own growing family refuge after 9/11, are no longer the beacons to newcomers that they once were. She is trying to make peace with what that means — for her clients, for herself, for her country.
“We’ve made so many enemies in the world. If the world is turning away from America, who could know the consequences that America is going to reap?” Margery asked.
“We may need to lose everything,” she added, “in order to be put back together again.”

(Photo by Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images)Gov. Josh Shapiro vowed on Saturday to take legal action against the federal government for a decision to remove an exhibit on slavery at Independence National Historic Park in Philadelphia.
“It is important that we do not allow them to succeed,” he said.

During his book launch of “Where We Keep the Light” at the Parkway Central Library in Philadelphia, Shapiro delivered pointed criticism at President Donald Trump’s administration for the Department of Interior’s actions on Thursday to remove the exhibit about the nine people enslaved by George Washington at the President’s House Site. He accused the federal government of attempting to divide people, while whitewashing the nation’s shared history. 
Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker’s administration, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, filed its lawsuit on Thursday and said that in 2006, the city and federal government signed a cooperative agreement that may require advance notice for changes to the site and added that the city is reviewing its options.

Shapiro said he is working closely with the Parker administration and will be filing an amicus brief to support them. 
“We are exploring ways in which we can get those displays back up either on city or state owned property nearby,” Shapiro said. 
Noting that the nation is celebrating its 250th birthday, Shapiro emphasized the importance for acknowledging history. 
“How can we go forward if we don’t know our history,” Shapiro. “How can we go forward if we don’t remember where we came from?”
“Those signs aren’t just signs. It’s not just metal and ink,” he added. “What that is, is our shared history.”
ABC News reported on Friday that a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior said the move complies with Trump’s executive order in March 2025 to remove “divisive, race-centered ideology” and narratives from federal cultural institutions.
However, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), an ally of Trump, also voiced his disagreement with removing the exhibit, while likening it to his opposition to the changing of names of some military bases.
“Our history is our history. It is our willingness to learn from it that makes America exceptional and the greatest country on Earth, on our journey to become a more perfect union,” McCormick wrote, in part, in a social media post on Saturday.
Shapiro expressed confidence that they will be successful in getting the display back up.
Shapiro says he’s prepared to protect the vote ahead of midterm elections
Shapiro said he “fully expects” Trump to “continue to try and undermine our elections,” ahead of the 2026 midterm, in response to a question submitted to the moderator by an audience member. 
“We continue to have free and fair, safe and secure elections,” he said. “I will do everything in my power to stop anyone from taking away your vote in the midterms.”
Shapiro, who was elected governor in 2022, is seeking a second term in November. His likely opponent is Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, who supports Trump.
He referenced his time as the state’s attorney general during the 2020 election when Trump sued the state 43 times in an effort to overturn the election, but was unsuccessful.

“Suffice to say we are on it. We are prepared,” Shapiro said. “We will do everything in our power to protect your vote. That is your power and we will protect it.”
Throughout the event, Shapiro delivered pointed criticism of Trump on a wide variety of matters, including his administration’s actions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 
Outside of the event, protesters gathered to call on Shapiro’s administration to not cooperate with ICE.
However, he also said Democrats have to do more than just fight against Trump, but have to make an effort to improve the lives of citizens. Shapiro touched on usual themes from his speeches about the importance of investing in education and public safety, while working across the aisle with Republicans, who hold a majority in the state Senate.
Recalling arson attack, Shapiro highlights power of prayer
For a sizable portion of the program, Shapiro, alongside Salem Baptist Church Pastor Marshall Mitchell, talked about how faith has shaped his life and career. 
Shapiro said he was five months into writing the book when Cody Balmer, a Harrisburg man, firebombed the Governor’s Residence while his family and guests were sleeping after Passover.

He said the power of prayer from people of all walks of life lifted him and his family up in that difficult moment. 
Shapiro also described growing up in a home that was structured around religion in Montgomery County, noting he attended a faith-based school, and celebrated shabbat dinner on Friday with his family. He said he and his wife, First Lady Lori Shapiro, raise their children to be connected to their faith.
Following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel by Hamas, Shapiro said he heard from those who were Jewish who were scared and said he felt a responsibility to be more open about this faith, as antisemitism and other forms of bigotry were on the rise.
Vice President Kamala Harris, who is mentioned in the book, considered Shapiro as her running mate in 2024 and reportedly asked if the governor had ever been an agent of Israel. CNN reports Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who Harris selected to run as vice president, was also asked if he had ever been an agent of China. Shapiro did not mention her during the event.
Multiple elected officials were in attendance, including U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-Philadelphia), state Sen. Sharif Street (D-Philadelphia), multiple members of the state House, and a representative from Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker’s office. 
State Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) was spotted outside at the immigration protest. 
2028 on the horizon
As Shapiro seeks a second term as governor, he is being mentioned as a potential candidate for the White House in 2028. 
Mitchell, who served as the moderator, ended the event by noting that Shapiro often talks about basketball in the book and referenced an analogy about how the governor wants the ball in his hand so he can take the shot. 
“There’s a lot of people in this room and a lot of people who are listening who are counting on you taking your shot,” Mitchell said. “Now and in the not-so-distant future.”
The next stops along the book tour for Shapiro include New York on Tuesday, Boston on Wednesday, and Washington D.C on Thursday.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/slavery-exhibit-philly-1-1024x661.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 04:57:16.760364

It’s just a budget. Boring finance stuff. All that math hurts my head.


Statehouse scraps
Opinion editor Clay Wirestone’s weekly roundup of Kansas legislative exploits. Read the archive.


You’ll hear phrases like these if you spend time following state government. One of its biggest purposes — if not its single-most important — consists of spending money for schools, roads and other public services. But budgets sound dull. Dealing with columns of figures puts many Kansans to sleep. It’s understandable.
It’s also dangerous. 
As I learned during my years in the nonprofit world, budgets are moral documents. What you choose to spend money on reveals what you prioritize. What you choose to cut reveals what you dismiss.
Just look at funding for public schools and universities.


Educational institutions with more resources can offer students more programs, more skilled teachers and more enrichment opportunities. Schools with fewer resources struggle to cover the basics. Kansans grasp this. Many move to Johnson County and other privileged communities for “good schools” supported by property taxes.
If the state doesn’t support public schools and universities adequately, what kind of judgment does it make about our state’s children and young adults? What kind of judgment does it make about our society and our future?
The Kansas Legislature’s annual budget debate is set to kick off with a Monday hearing. I urge you to pay attention, to actively track where the money goes. Watch what lawmakers actually do with the billions of dollars that comprise our state budget. Are they using those dollars to support the people of Kansas — especially those most in need of assistance — or are they handing out freebies to favored groups?
You will hear one claim at some moment that they have to go along with a cut they don’t like or a long-term reduction they hope to reverse in the future. Treat them with the utmost skepticism.
Every lawmaker, Republican and Democrat, conservative and liberal, has free will. They have the ability to choose. They will all make moral judgments in the days and weeks ahead. Let’s see what they do.

Higher education chatter
I dropped by the weekly press conference held by House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard and Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, both Lenexa Democrats, on Thursday. The two chatted with reporters about the budget rush (see above) and life in the opposition party.
One question raised was whether the Legislature would take dramatic steps to reduce spending. And by dramatic, I mean closing Emporia State University.
Woodard told me in a follow-up email: “There has been talk of that my whole time in the legislature, but I haven’t seen any action steps to actually make that a reality. I think with a new leader, they can restore the faith and enrollment in Emporia State University.”
As I wrote last month, let’s hope thats true.
Former Emporia State president Ken Hush, meanwhile, has been brought on as a budget consultant for the Legislature. But Woodard told the assembled reporters Thursday that he hadn’t seen hide nor hair of the man.
“As one of his eight bosses, I haven’t had a conversation with him since they allegedly hired him for $10,000 a month,” the House minority leader said. “I haven’t seen him in any of the budget committees.”
I have spotted Hush hurrying through the Statehouse hallways, but apparently he wasn’t going to meet Democrats.
Woodard told me he hoped lawmakers would soon have a broader conversation about Kansas higher education. That doesn’t mean closing Emporia State, but it could mean considering tough steps. As demographics change and fewer students enroll, problems will inevitably follow.
“I do hope we can start strategic planning for what our university system looks like two decades from now after the enrollment cliff, and whether it is feasible to maintain six institutions or not,” he wrote.

Friendlier vibe detected
I’ve detected a slightly different tone at the Kansas Statehouse this session. Maybe the upcoming primary and general elections are the cause, maybe folks have just showed up with different dispositions.
In either case, I’ve noted a generally lower temperature and slightly friendlier vibe. This doesn’t mean the Legislature will get around to serving everyday Kansas anytime soon, mind you, but perhaps that accelerated schedule and a desire to avoid looking like extremists in front of voters has sanded the rough edges off a handful of legislators.
Budget hearings this week will be a test, as will the ongoing partisan shadowboxing in Rep. Pat Proctor’s House Elections Committee. Can even lower-key lawmakers restrain themselves when the chance to undercut Democrats or poor people arises?
We’ll all have to wait and see.

Kansas Reflector funding
The question of how Kansas Reflector is funded comes up every year or two. We’ve always been open and honest about the process, but in case you haven’t heard our explanation before, here it is.
We’re part of States Newsroom, a national nonprofit devoted to providing state news coverage of issues that otherwise would go underreported, or unreported. When Kansas Reflector launched on July 21, 2020, we were the organization’s 18th outlet. States Newsroom now oversees newsrooms in 39 states and has content-sharing agreements with nonprofits in the other 11. In other words, we have boots on the ground in every state of the nation.
Based in North Carolina, States Newsroom handles high-level fundraising and human resource duties for all of these outlets. You can read our parent’s tax returns and browse a list of everyone who has contributed more than $1,000 at statenewsroom.com/support.
If you want to know more about the organization, feel free to read these pieces from The Washington Post and the Columbia Journalism Review.
In recent years, Kansas Reflector has focused more on local fundraising. In 2025, we’re proud to say that we brought in a record amount from folks across the state, who donated an average of $38 apiece. In total, you all contributed an amount that equates to about 40% of our yearly budget.
Folks at the town halls we’ve held across the state sometimes ask how solid we feel about our funding model and our future.
The answer? We feel good about both.
Admittedly, the news media faces challenges from every front. But as long as we do our jobs to the best of our ability, and as long as Kansans support our work as strongly as they have in recent years, I expect us to be around for a long time to come.
Kansas lawmakers should take note.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Last year, Congress rushed to push through all of the president’s wish list as H.R. 1, the “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” while the new president’s honeymoon poll numbers were still intact. 
The bill enacted a range of policies, including making President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent, exempting tips and overtime from federal income taxes, and requiring new work requirements for safety net features like Medicaid.
One item that flew under the radar for many but has been reported by the Cleveland-based Center for Community Solutions since last year is a provision that changes the funding structure for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, previously known as “food stamps”). 
The new law enacted new requirements on states, requiring them to reduce benefit provision error rates or be required to pick up larger parts of the tab for SNAP.
The problem with this requirement is that Congress set the required error rate so low that only seven states would have achieved it in 2024.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to the Center for Community Solutions, Ohio’s error rate was 9% in 2024 and if Ohio’s rate is that high in 2026, the state will be on the hook for $318 million in SNAP payments that it previously did not have to pay.
An estimate by the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality in September put that number at closer to $390 million. 
It seems like whomever you ask, Ohio will be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars if it wants to keep its SNAP program.
To understand the scale of this, a $318 million new SNAP obligation would make Ohio’s new SNAP obligation on its own as expensive as a top-10 agency in the state government. 
That would make continuing to fund SNAP as expensive as Ohio’s entire Department of Natural Resources, Department of Health, and Department of Transportation combined according to Legislative Service Commission data.
$300 million or more is no tiny line item, even for a large state like Ohio. 
Ohio has previously balked at proposals for $300 million food programs, so there is a strong scenario that Ohio ends up with a $300 million tab from the federal government later this year and state legislators balk at it, leading to the end of the SNAP program in Ohio.
SNAP is a big deal. 
It is one of the largest antipoverty programs in the country, pulling an estimated 3.6 million Americans out of poverty. 
In our 2024 study of poverty in Ohio, we estimated that over 1.5% of the state population is kept out of poverty by SNAP. That means that under a conservative scenario, 180,000 Ohio residents would be plunged into poverty by dropping the program.
SNAP is a program that reduces poverty, reduces food insecurity, and supports local grocers. 
Losing the $260 million a month that the federal government finances in grocery spending in Ohio through SNAP will mean the closing of grocery stores that serve low-income households across the state, especially considering the low margins grocery stores run on. 
This could be especially devastating for low-income, rural communities like Vinton County, Ohio, which endured a stint a decade ago where it had no grocery store throughout the entire county.
Ohio is on the precipice of facing the consequences of H.R. 1. 
Hopefully federal policymakers realize the dangers of playing chicken with the U.S. safety net and decide to pump the brakes, otherwise hundreds of thousands of low-income residents in Ohio will suffer.

Or even an average one. 
While knowing how and why government works is a good start, elected leaders need much more to steer any ship of state and keep it from running aground on everything from debilitating partisanship to undue special interest influence to wing-nut conspiracy theories. 
That said, please do not confuse the broadside above with me finding Legislative Bill 1066 wholly disagreeable. The proposed legislation would require Nebraska state senators to take a 20-question civics test and post their scores on the Nebraska Legislature’s website.
Support for civics emphasis
Holding political office without a grounding in civics is a poor look, one that eventually comes to light. Cases in point: A U.S. senator from Alabama and now candidate for governor there famously did not know the aforementioned three branches of government. Another U.S. senator publicly confused the Constitution with the Declaration of Independence. The Secretary of Homeland Security didn’t know the meaning of habeas corpus.
While a nominal civic education assures nothing, it is critical to be an effective office holder. LB 1066 hopes to remedy potential failings among those who represent us in the Unicameral.
Should Nebraska legislators be tested on civics knowledge? New bill says yes.

A state senator would have 90 days after taking office to tackle LB 1066’s 20 questions on civics and U.S. history, which could be the same as those administered to individuals hoping to become naturalized American citizens. 
I hate to pick nits, but the timing seems a little strange. Some voters might want to see test results before an election rather than after. Just saying.
While knowledge of civics and U.S. history are important, for my money an effective senator provides leadership despite the room’s temperature and the political pressure gauge’s reading; has a penchant for thinking critically lest unintended consequences derail what seemed like a good idea at the time; displays a willingness to use proven science rather than political expediency in writing laws; and rocks an attitude of collegiality without being a doormat, carrying someone else’s water or hiding in the smallness of ad hominem attacks. 
Otherwise special sessions get called to undo a safe haven law, an abundance of medical research, and experience gets ignored for political purposes. Name-calling passes for argument and wisdom.
Communism and more
The Legislature also will be thinking about communism this session or, more to the point, a duplication of communism. Senators will be debating LB 1024, which would require Nebraska public schools to add teaching the dangers of communism to school curricula, although it’s already part of the state’s social studies standards.
New bill would require Nebraska K-12 schools to teach anti-communist lessons

Aside from the duplicative nature of LB 1024, a reading of its seven pages reveals at best a set of curricular guidelines and at worst a class syllabus, neither of which seem to be in the Legislature’s charge, let alone its wheelhouse. Plus, nowhere in the introduced legislation is definitive evidence of “the increasing threat of communism in the United States …,” the basis on which LB 1024 is being proposed. 
Research shows some young Americans have looked at ideas more aligned with democratic socialism than communism, but it, too, is already covered in the state standards. Some might remember when we liked Ike, swiveled hula hoops around our waists, hard passed on the Edsel and at least a few people checked under their beds for commies. 
Aside from LB 1024’s communist focus providing a twinkle of the past, it might also provide a good civics test question: Who said and to whom and why, “Have you no sense of decency, sir?”
Voting knowledge
Finally, even though state senators would already be in office when they saddled up for a LB 1066 civics exam, the value of a knowledgeable class of political leaders extends well beyond the Nebraska Capitol and into the voting booth. 
Political and social scientists call those poorly informed who cast ballots, “low-information voters.” No term that I know of captures the phenomenon for those already in office and writing laws.
Finally, if LB 1066 passes, senators airing their “academic” laundry on the Legislature’s website deserve props. Never mind that Nebraskans would know the senators’ scores. Each of us has our own responsibility to be fully and factually informed, making good on that whole watchfulness in the citizen idea. 
It is indeed our salvation. Which also just might make another good question.

(Sarah Ladd/ Kentucky Lantern)An Oldham County mother has filed a lawsuit against Kentucky child welfare officials, alleging they violated state open records law by failing to provide records related to child deaths and serious injuries from neglect and abuse.
Jennifer Mortenson, who has 12 children, six of whom are adopted, said she is seeking the records to determine whether there are gaps in Kentucky’s system when it comes to protecting children.
While the Cabinet for Health and Family Services has provided thousands of pages of the records, it hasn’t fully complied with her request, has missed deadlines set by state law, provided incomplete files and has heavily redacted the material, according to the lawsuit filed Dec. 23 in Franklin Circuit Court.
“I’m not trying to make things difficult but open records are what they are,” Mortenson, a longtime child advocate, said in an interview. “You’re legally entitled to them.”
A Health and Family Services spokeswoman responded that the cabinet is complying with Mortenson’s request and continues to do so on a “rolling basis” as it reviews case files for release and redacts some information for privacy reasons.
“Following its commitment to transparency, the cabinet has provided extensive records in response to the open records request and has continually informed the requester of its ongoing review of records and the time needed to complete the review,” spokeswoman Beth Fisher said in an email. “At this time the cabinet has provided about 8,800 pages of records with necessary redactions and is reviewing between 12,000 and 14,000 additional records.”
As for potential gaps in child protection, Fisher said the cabinet’s “top priority is the health and safety of the Kentuckians we serve — especially children — and we remain committed to doing that work transparently and in accordance with our state laws.”
Access to some child protection records have been well-established by the courts in recent years.
In 2016, after a seven-year legal battle with the Louisville Courier Journal and the Lexington Herald-Leader, the state conceded that files it keeps of child deaths and near fatal-injuries are public records. The cabinet settled the legal battle by agreeing to pay the newspapers nearly $700,000 in penalties and legal costs.
The Todd County Standard, in a separate case, also won the right to obtain records related to the 2011 death of a child in that county who was fatally beaten after the cabinet placed her in an adoptive home.
The records of the case involving Amy Dye, 9, of Todd County, were particularly damaging. It became a symbol of systemic failures after records the state released showed state social service officials had disregarded repeated abuse allegations from teachers at her school.
No longer confidential
The cabinet for years had argued all such records were confidential but eventually agreed to abide by court rulings that found that cases in which a child dies or nearly dies from suspected abuse or neglect are subject to open records law.
There have been about 200 or more such cases per year in Kentucky over the past several years.
An outside panel that reviews all child deaths or severe injuries from suspected abuse or neglect reported in its most recent annual report that it examined 70 child deaths and 149 near-deaths in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2023. It reviewed 68 deaths and 134 near deaths of children the previous year.
Mortenson said she wants more details about how the cabinet identifies and investigates such cases.
Mortenson said she and her husband, Matthew, became foster-adoptive parents in 2016. (Such parents provide temporary care for children with the goal of reuniting them with their parents but are prepared to legally adopt.) She also helps operate Hope’s Closet, which provides free children’s clothing and other items for foster, adoptive and kinship families.
She serves on the cabinet’s Trusted Advisors Council, a panel of individuals who have been involved with the foster adoptive system that recommend changes and identify areas of concern.
Mortenson said she first began requesting records in September 2025 of all child deaths and near-deaths from abuse or neglect for 2024 and the first eight months of 2025 but doesn’t believe the cabinet is fully complying.
Mortenson’s lawsuit has been assigned to Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd, whose previous rulings upheld public access to such records in the cases brought by the newspapers starting in 2009.
Mortenson also has filed a complaint with the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services outlining her concerns.
‘Plan of safe care’
Mortenson said she has become increasingly concerned about several areas where she sees gaps in protection for children and hopes to use the information to encourage lawmakers to strengthen laws.
One such area is how state social services staff oversee cases of newborns exposed to substances such as drugs or alcohol including those born with neonatal abstinence syndrome — in withdrawal from drugs, usually opioids, but often more than one substance.
Federal law requires state child welfare workers to create what’s known as a “Plan of Safe Care” for such newborns, meant to ensure the health and safety of the baby and support parents and caregivers.
Yet an outside panel that reviews child abuse deaths and near fatalities in Kentucky last year found in more than a third of the cases it reviewed of infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, no record of such a plan could be found. The Child Fatality and Near Fatality External Review Panel concluded that was likely an “underestimate” of newborns without such plans.
Even as cases of infants born exposed to substances or in withdrawal have risen steadily in recent years, its report found the safety plan “is rarely available to most Kentucky families who are in dire need.” Such infants are at greater risk for health problems as well as abuse and neglect, the report said.
The panel noted that last year was the second year in a row it has recommended improving the system to provide such safety plans for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, noting that they are at risk of health problems as well as injury and death from abuse and neglect.
“Year after year, the panel has documented that these children are at serious risk of maltreatment,” the report said.
A state health office that tracks such births found a slight decrease in 2024 in the number of infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome.
In 2024, there were 741 cases of babies with signs and symptoms of the syndrome versus 792 cases reported in 2023, according to the Kentucky Public Health Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Reporting Registry 2025 annual report.
Among its recommendations: “Every infant, including those prenatally exposed to drugs or alcohol, should leave the hospital with an appropriate plan of safe care.”
But Mortenson said she doesn’t believe that’s happening, based on records she has collected and reviewed so far.
Her complaint to the federal health agency states that she believes safety plans are only documented in “a small percentage of cases” of newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome. Her complaint said that appears to result from failure of a health provider to diagnose and report the condition to child welfare authorities as well as the failure of Kentucky Child Protective Services (CPS) to investigate and follow up on all such cases brought to its attention.
Cases ‘screened out?’
Mortenson also said she’s concerned that in many cases of child abuse and neglect, perpetrators are not prosecuted. She’s also concerned that Child Protective Services “screens out” too many reports of suspected abuse or neglect as not meriting an investigation, a concern also highlighted by the outside panel in its most recent report.
“Screening out of CPS referrals has been a concern addressed by the panel for many years and continues to be the most frequently identified area of concern,” its report said.
The cabinet, which investigates and decides whether to substantiate suspected abuse or neglect of children, says that while reports of suspected abuse have risen over the past several years, substantiations have “steadily decreased” over the past five years.
In 2024, 127,342 suspected cases were reported while 43,668 were accepted for investigation — the rest screened out. Of those, 8,196 cases of abuse or neglect were substantiated, according to an annual report by the cabinet.
Mortenson said she believes cases may be falling through the cracks of a chronically overworked and understaffed child welfare system.
Mortenson is not a lawyer but is representing herself in her open records lawsuit. She also plans to contact state legislators and enlist their support.
“My goal is to help identify the gaps and push legislation that will help protect children,” she said. “If I can help create the rules, maybe we can save some lives.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3810-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 00:56:59.235826

In 1975, a utility company needed a small legal favor, so they wrote a draft opinion and slipped it to him.
The late Justice Joseph Boyd Jr., via Florida Supreme Court
That is not, as I’m sure you are aware, normal.
Boyd said he did nothing improper: Indeed, he said, he promptly hopped to the gents’, tore the thing up, and flushed it.
This sounded sufficiently odd to the Florida Legislature that they threatened to impeach him, only backing down when he agreed to a psychiatric exam.
He convinced the doctor he was not, in fact, as nutty as a fruitcake.
These days, you wouldn’t be blamed for thinking psychiatric exams might be in order for some in Florida’s political and legal establishment.
Or, even better, a moral compass: Many of the judges appointed over the last seven or eight years seem to have misplaced theirs.
Florida has just acquired a new Supreme Court justice, appointed by the governor.
There is no suggestion, however, he’s mentally ill. As for a moral compass, well, that remains to be seen.
Justice Charles Canady recently vacated the bench to parachute into a sweet gig directing the University of Florida’s new Hamilton Center for Classical and Civic Education.
White males
There were six Federalist Society candidates on the governor’s shortlist, raring to take Canady’s place: all male, all white.
One hopeful used to work for Liberty Counsel, an outfit that advocates for laws adhering to “Christian and biblical” principles.
One was on the First District Court of Appeals, where he ruled to dilute Black voting power by abolishing a North Florida congressional district.
One had an unremarkable practice in civil litigation; another wasn’t known for having a significant impact on the legal profession, but did gain some notoriety with distinctly un-clever X quips accusing late night hosts Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and Jimmy Fallon of having “Low T” and snickering like a third-grader at a “gross” picture of President Joe Biden kissing his wife, to which he added a cartoon of skeletal elderly folks having sex.
This is what passes for “judicial temperament” in Ron DeSantis’ Florida.
And how about this fellow John Guard, formerly Florida’s chief deputy attorney general?
He defended the state against Planned Parenthood and other Jezebels who think women should have control over their own bodies.
Donald Trump had planned to nominate Guard for a federal judgeship, but put that on “indefinite” hold after Guard was subpoenaed in connection with the Hope Florida investigation.
In case you’ve forgotten, Hope Florida is a program spearheaded by Casey DeSantis to bypass Big Gubmint nonsense like healthcare for children, housing assistance, and SNAP benefits, hooking up the Deserving Poor with churches and charities.
In 2024, Hope Florida was mysteriously given a nice hunk of cash from the $67 million settlement in a Medicaid over-billing case.
It should all have been returned to the taxpayers, but somehow Hope Florida got $10 million off the top.
Gingrich acolyte
The money went to a couple of PACs working against the proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana.
One of the PACs was controlled by James Uthmeier, then the governor’s chief of staff, now Florida’s attorney general and former boss of John Guard.
To many in the Legislature, that looked like money laundering.
The House of Representatives investigated; now the whole mess has been given to a grand jury to see if anybody needs indicting.
You will not be surprised to hear, given the circumstances, DeSantis didn’t choose Guard for the state Supreme Court.
You might be surprised to hear Guard got a nice consolation prize: an appointment to the Florida Second District Court of Appeal.
Adam Tanenbaum, via Florida Supreme Court
But the winner of the Supreme Court stakes is Adam Tanenbaum, a very conservative judge with a very impressive resumé: top of his class at UF, former intern for Newt Gingrich, stellar student at Georgetown, law professor, lots of experience working in the Legislature, and, most recently, First DCA judge.
Tanenbaum joins a court comprising three Latino men, one Black woman, and two white women. Canady was the lone white fellow.
So, Tanenbaum adds what DeSantis no doubt thinks is appropriate “diversity” to the court.
As the president reminds us, white people, especially white men, white people, especially men, have been “very badly treated” in America.
But with the new justice, the court can be proud of its ethnic diversity.
Its ideological diversity, however, is pretty much non-existent.
Six of the seven justices are DeSantis picks.
Six of the seven can be relied upon to rule the way DeSantis would like.
Sole dissent
In 2025, the court upheld the state’s six-week abortion ban and gutted Florida’s Fair Districts amendment.
Never mind that 63% of Florida voters approved the 2010 ballot measure to stop partisan gerrymandering and protect minority voting rights.
This court blew it off: How dare ordinary citizens choose to enshrine fairness in the Florida Constitution? What do they know?
For that matter, what does the American Bar Association, the 147-year-old group of legal professionals dedicated to upholding ethics and standards and promoting equal justice, know?
The court has now dumped the ABA as the state’s exclusive law school accrediting body, saying, “The Court is persuaded that it is not in Floridians’ best interest for the ABA to be the sole gatekeeper deciding which law schools’ graduates are eligible to sit for the state’s General Bar Examination and become licensed attorneys in Florida.”
Ron DeSantis loathes the ABA, calling it “a very, very partisan activist organization” because it promotes racial and ethnic diversity in law schools.
(See discrimination against white men above).
This would be the same radical Democratic Party ABA apparatchiks who gave U.S. Supreme Court justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito their highest rating of “Well Qualified.”
As of right now, there isn’t really an alternative to the ABA.
Perhaps the Association for Biblical Higher Education can step up until the Federalist Society can create its own Law School Inquisition.
Who needs an independent judiciary? So 20th century.
The (sort of) good news is retrograde decisions weren’t unanimous: one justice, Jorge Labarga, appointed by Gov. Charlie Crist, cast a dissenting vote in each case.
Channeling slaveholders
The bad news is Labarga only has another 18 months on the bench: When he turns 75 in 2027, he’ll have to retire.
Tanenbaum’s record indicates he’s unlikely to join the court’s last moderate in voting against the majority.
When he was an appeals court judge, he ruled in favor of eliminating minority-access voting districts and penalizing school districts for enforcing mask mandates during the COVID pandemic.
He’s an out-and-proud “originalist,” one of those people who confuse the United States Constitution with holy writ — a trait he shares with six members of the U.S. Supreme Court — a sacred text that can only mean what it meant in 1789, law as set in stone as the Code of Hammurabi.
In 1789, women couldn’t vote and almost all Black people resident in the 13 states were enslaved.
Indeed, 25 of 55 Framers were slaveholders.
Unless these 18th century landed gentlemen had the prophetic talents of Nostradamus, a magic mirror, and time travel technology, they could have no idea what America would be like in the 21st century.
Yet the likes of Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Adam Tanenbaum insist they hold the key to what the Framers intended and/or what everyone understood to the Constitution to mean at the time.
Originalism is, as the prominent legal scholar Eric Segall says, “dangerous nonsense.”
It’s intellectually dishonest, too: Surely, “well-regulated militia” in 1789 meant a trained group of citizens who could protect the community against some tyrannical force, not (as the conservative court would have us believe) a nation of armed individuals empowered to shoot anyone who “threatens” them.
Stare decisis
As for stare decisis, the principle that courts should give a certain deference to precedents, it’s not popular with Federalist Society types.
Justice Tanenbaum has dismissed stare decisis as an excuse for what he sees as incorrectly decided cases.
Many of those supposedly bad decisions constitute “legislating from the bench,” which is nothing more than “judicial activism.”
(The overturning of Roe v. Wade and giving the president unlimited immunity — that’s not “judicial activism;” it’s just the intuited wisdom of 237 years ago).
The language of the Constitution should be paramount. If the judge will simply do what it says, no one can say they’re legislating from the bench.
Tanenbaum has written: “elevating the text of the Constitution over prior erroneous judicial reasoning could not fairly be labeled as ‘judicial activism.’”
You might want to ask how he’s so sure he knows what reasoning is “erroneous.”
You might also wonder if this is merely a convenient way to dismiss previously settled law because it offends the judge’s politics.
The United States Supreme Court will soon issue a decision on the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the core of civil rights in our democracy. Chances are better than even they’ll eviscerate it.
Ron DeSantis is counting on it. That’s why he’s demanding a special session in April.
He wants the Legislature to draw new congressional maps — maps to finally finish off most districts that might elect a Black or Latino or, God forbid, Democratic representative.
If the new map gets through the Legislature, it will undoubtedly end up before the Florida Supreme Court — and the governor’s hand-picked justices are waiting.
We’ll soon find out how sane and how moral they are.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IMG_009825873-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-26 00:56:59.235826

FRANKFORT — Brittany Herrington missed her son’s first time catching the flu, his first time riding a bike, his bout with chickenpox and the way his toddler “fat face” came in because she was incarcerated. 
Herrington had asked to be court-ordered to a residential treatment program but was denied. Outpatient treatment, too difficult to reach from her rural Kentucky home, was not fully effective for her. 
Without that rigorous, inpatient care that she sought, Herrington didn’t know how to get sober, which she desperately wanted so she could show up for her child. 
The Eastern Kentucky woman, now 41 and a mom of two, finally got access to effective treatment, but said “it came years too late.” 
Once in a residential program, she wrote little Gavin letters — “Mommy loves you more than pepperoni pizza,” one said — and drew small pictures to mail him. 
“He knew that I was fun and I loved him enough to draw pictures, and I wasn’t a stranger,” she said. “I was really scared he’d forget me.” 
Herrington is now advocating for a bill introduced by Kentucky lawmakers this week and backed by a slew of advocacy organizations that could change the incarceration landscape for Kentucky parents by considering alternatives to detention. 
The Family Preservation Act 
Rep. Nick Wilson, R-Williamsburg, said his goal is keeping more families together, teaching parents how to parent and reducing child trauma through the state. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
Filed as House Bill 464, the Family Preservation and Accountability Act would allow judges to consider an alternative sentence for parents charged with low-level, nonviolent crimes to keep families together. Violent crimes, including child abuse, are banned for consideration. Alternatives to detention as outlined in the bill may include parenting classes, substance use treatment, family counseling and more. It has not yet been assigned to a committee. 
Rep. Nick Wilson, R-Williamsburg, the bill’s sponsor, said his goal is keeping more families together, teaching parents how to parent and reducing child trauma through the state. 










Kentucky kids should not serve their parents’ sentences


– Amber Duke, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky


Having a parent incarcerated is an adverse childhood experience that can negatively impact a person’s life over the long term. About 12% of Kentucky children have or previously had a parent incarcerated, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky. That’s about 150,000 children across 120 counties. 
“I’m a kid of the ’90s, and I remember in Little League baseball, and around that age, basically everybody who got a backache was getting prescribed an OxyContin,” Wilson said. “I think we are still seeing the detrimental effects of what happened for that 10, 15, 20-year period of time.” 
One of those key impacts, Wilson said, “has been the deterioration of the family union.”

Even though overdose deaths have declined over the last three years, Kentucky still has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder in the United States, costing the state about $95 billion, with an average cost per case of $709,441 across all systems, the Lantern has reported. 
Sen. Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, plans to file the bill in the Senate. She said Wilson’s measure is “practical, responsible and important.” 
“These situations (low-level, nonviolent crimes) still demand accountability, but they also allow parents to remain connected to their children when it is safe to do so,” she said. “This approach is fiscally responsible. It costs so much less than incarceration. It reduces repeat offenses, and, most importantly, it produces better outcomes for our kids.” 
Amber Duke, the executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
Kentucky incarcerates women at one of the highest rates in the world, according to the ACLU, and the state reports the second highest rate in the nation for children who have parents behind bars. 
Amber Duke, the executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky, said this is hurting family stability. 
“Kentucky kids should not serve their parents’ sentences,” Duke said. “Accountability is something that is important. Accountability is not something that should destroy families. It should not come at the expense of our children’s well being, and kids should not be punished for their parents’ mistakes.” 
Wilson said he believes there is substantial legislative support for this bill: “I think everyone’s in favor of this bill,” he said.  
“This bill does not excuse wrongdoing. It does not weaken public safety, and in fact, it improves it,” Raque Adams said. “We know that stable families are one of the strongest foundations for a healthy society.” 
‘I did the best I could’
Brittany Herrington holds a photo of her visit with Gavin in jail back in 2010. Jan. 22, 2026. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)
Herrington, of Argillite, developed an addiction to OxyContin as a teenager. 
“During my years in high school … that’s what you did. You went and you did Lortabs together,” she told the Lantern. “The cheerleaders, the band kids, the average Joes. We all just got high. In high school it was Lortabs, Xanaxes and Valium, but it quickly moved to OxyContin.” 
Gavin was 2 years old when she had her first felony arrest in 2009 for drug possession, wanton endangerment, receiving stolen property and other related charges. 
Herrington said she asked the judge to send her to residential treatment. She knew she couldn’t afford rehabilitation on her own. 
Instead, the judge sent her to an outpatient program 25 miles from her home. With only one car between her, her husband, her parents and brother, getting to treatment four days a week was “an impossible task.” 
“I was court ordered to a treatment center I couldn’t really even get to,” she said. “I did the best I could for as long as I could, to make it there four days a week, and I just couldn’t.” 
She only lasted a few months.

In March 2010, a failed drug test sent her back to jail. She asked for rehab again, she said. She was denied and spent the next nine months — out of a three-year sentence — incarcerated. 
During that time, she saw her son once. During his visit, she borrowed clothes from a fellow inmate so she could be in “street clothes” to see him. 
“He was just different,” she recalled. “His face was different, his body. I picked him up, and he weighed, like, a million pounds. He was a different kid. He was in a different growth stage.” 
She thinks he only changed in weight 12-15 pounds, but his “fat face” had come in, and he looked different. She’d missed a lot, she realized.  
“You feel like an a**hole,” she said. “You can’t function because you feel worthless. You feel not worthy of anything. You’ve left your son. Your choices have separated you, you just feel like a crappy, crappy human. The worst. You just feel despicable, like, who does that?” 
But, for so long, addiction controlled her, she said. 
“I hated getting high,” she recalled. “Oh, I hated it.” She hated the sickness that came after, the feeling of no control. 
Herrington was paroled that December and went to the Women’s Addiction Recovery Manor, an inpatient recovery center in Henderson. There, she took parenting classes and started a journey of long-term recovery and advocacy. The experience was “overwhelming,” though. 
“Anytime I talked about leaving, I was scared to death,” she said. “Like, ‘oh my God. I was so serious about staying sober before, and I didn’t do it … What if I can’t?’” 
But, she said, while there: “Every day, I got to watch women get their kids back.” 
Before long, she and her husband, John, and Gavin were settling in together under the same roof. She could be an active parent, and “we were family again.” 
She is still sober 14 years later and an active advocate for women going through experiences similar to the one she survived. 
After jail, finding her own Healing Place
Jessica Ashby, 41, was prescribed Oxycodone after the birth of her daughter, a treatment for standard pain that “unleashed a monster” of addiction in her life.

“When I took home that prescription, I didn’t know that they were highly addictive,” Ashby said. “I thought it was going to be OK. It was from my doctor. Why would he give me something that is going to turn around and make me sick later?” 
She spent three years “doing anything and everything I could to support that habit,” she told the Lantern. She was arrested on a theft charge in 2014 and spent 17 months in and out of jail. 
She said she lacked access to treatment and resources that could have helped her begin to get sober. She lost her job and custody of her daughter. 
“I just couldn’t get clean,” she said. “Most people don’t really commit felonies unless there’s … an underlying issue.” She wanted help, though, and finally got it. 
In 2019, Ashby drove herself to The Healing Place in Louisville, where she still attends — and teaches — classes. 
“I finally started to feel like I was in a community. I was in a community with people like me,” she said. “They help people write resumes. They did all of those things that were critical in early sobriety.” 
She’s been sober about seven years thanks to The Healing Place, support she received from her 12-step program and other organizations geared toward early stages of sobriety. She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in December and has begun work toward a master’s degree. 
Ashby just bought her first house in Louisville.
If something like the Family Preservation and Accountability Act that Wilson is proposing had been in place when she was first arrested, Ashby believes she and her daughter “would still be together.” 
“I completely understand that … people like me, if we had committed the crime, I understand that we still have to be punished,” she said. “I understand that wholeheartedly, but our kids are the one that’s being punished, so we have to find a way to deal with the crime while addressing whatever’s going on in that parent’s life. And I think that this bill does that.”

Young men have increasingly leaned towards the conservative, Republican party while women have moved towards the liberal, Democratic party. While gender gaps are a feature in every generation, none have been as stark as Gen Z. 
Who is the main driver? Women. They are now the force pushing Gen Z towards the left politically and socially, and becoming increasingly more civically active compared to any other generation. There are divides not just about how they feel about political candidates, but cultural issues which could deeply affect America.



Generation Z, which I am a part of, is the cohort born between 1997 and 2012. My generation has been shaped by rapid technology growth, social media, witnessing financial crises, wars, and climate change. 
Contrary to the conventional wisdom that young voters support progressive candidates and policies, in the most recent presidential election, men between the ages of 18 and 29 showed immense support for the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. However, women have become a cohesive force for the Democratic party, with about 65 percent voting for Biden in 2020 and Harris in 2024. 
This gender divide is complex, rooted in differences in politics and social issues. In terms of politics, only 26 percent of Gen Z women approve of the job that Donald Trump is doing in office compared to 47 percent of Gen Z men. On the question of abortion, 76 percent of women believe that abortion should be legal, whereas 59 percent of men believe it should be legal.

Rosemary Bonadies

Women’s activism is now amplified by the fact that we make up around sixty percent of college students, contributing to the trend that higher educated individuals tend to be liberal. With greater access to higher education and economic opportunity, women are now more empowered to play a larger role in political activism and voting, while men have fallen behind women in civic engagement. 
Alongside this increase in engagement, there is the fact that women’s rights are being increasingly threatened under the Trump administration. After movements like #MeToo and the fall of Roe v. Wade, many women feel a sense of urgency and personal investment, whereas Gen Z men don’t have the same sentiment. Moreover, this reflects both differences in priorities and experiences. 
Many men feel that their rights and lifestyle are being infringed upon so they seek validation from communities online. The feeling of losing influence in many aspects of society has led them to turn to misogynistic social media influencers like Charlie Kirk, Andrew Tate, or Adin Ross who have created a mass following. They have become pillars of hypermasculinity and misogyny by promoting hate and violence against women. 
Additionally, these influencers have become prominent recruiters for the right wing Republican party by framing politicians like Trump as an empowering figure who will restore male power. With social media algorithms and echo chambers, podcasters, YouTubers and other online influencers, can easily engage young men and boys – some as young as middle school – to promote conservatism rooted in male dominance, and a community of men who have common ground.
Algorithms turn everyday interests like fitness, relationships, and gaming into gateways to the manosphere. They thrive on male loneliness and insecurity about themselves and the world around them and move the blame to women.
These political shifts also go beyond just political candidates, they have put a strain on romantic and platonic relationships, as women and men are no longer spending time together, rather they are spending time in their separate echo chambers – creating their own sense of reality on social media. As young men are holding onto the belief in more traditional gender roles and family structures, Gen Z women are valuing independence, their careers, and progressive reform.
As a member of Gen Z, I have experienced this divide. I and many other women my age have become concerned with issues like abortion, the environment, gun laws, and equality while many of our male counterparts don’t feel the same or prioritize other issues. 
Why is this important? Who does it affect? It is important because this signals deepening polarization that has shown to put a strain on relationships. As Gen Z becomes older, there will be less social cohesion and greater risks to democratic consensus. With the effects of social media algorithms and echo chambers, there will be irreversible polarization and instability. 
Polarization has effects on housing, jobs, welfare, social relationships, mental health, and families.
What can we do? In short, educate. 
As Gen Z, we can develop our media literacy and learn to combat misinformation. Introduce media literacy in school curriculum; parents can educate their children on media influence – young boys about misogynistic language and media, and young girls about self confidence. We can foster better empathy and understanding for personal gender struggles including women’s underrepresentation and hardships and men’s mental health struggles. Men with large platforms must promote equality, emotional intelligence, and mental health resources. We can focus on common struggles that we have experienced like economic opportunities, housing, and anxieties about the future.
Understanding the causes and consequences of this political and social split helps us navigate the lasting effects of social media, misinformation, the need for education, and relationships. Ultimately, Gen Z’s historic gender divide is not a myth, but a tangible reality shown in activism, ideologies, and voting across the country. 
As a generation, we can work towards a better cohesive force that focuses on growth and positive change.

Wes Moore (D) said he and federal officials agree on the importance of moving forward with the rebuild of the Francis Scott Key Bridge as well as a potential new American Legion Bridge. (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Even before this month’s meeting between Gov. Wes Moore and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy jump-started talk of public-private funding to replace the American Legion Bridge, federal officials were already moving in that direction.
In a Federal Register post Dec. 11, the Federal Highway Administration solicited “public input and proposals on innovative project delivery methods to ensure cost-effective and efficient reconstruction of the American Legion Memorial Bridge.” The post noted that the state cannot fund the project on its own, before noting that a public-private partnership (P3) could do the trick.
Just over a month later, Moore and Duffy announced they had agreed on “the need to speed up the reconstruction and leverage innovative approaches like a public private partnership (P3) that will ensure Maryland, Virginia, and D.C. commuters can soon experience some much needed traffic relief from the most congested corridor in America.”
It was a change of course for Moore who inherited the framework of a P3 deal from his predecessor, Gov. Larry Hogan (R), for the American Legion Bridge and additional toll lanes on the Capital Beltway. But the state and Transurban, the company behind the proposed P3, were not able to finalize the deal, and P3 funding fell by the wayside.
In a meeting with reporters Jan. 16, Moore said he was never “against P3s. I’m against dumb P3s.”
“And I think we had dumb P3s that were put in place before,” Moore said. “I’m for P3s. Yes, there is going to be private-sector involvement, but the entire upside can’t be on the private sector while the public sector gets hooked.
State reopens door to private funding for American Legion Bridge reconstruction

“And so, we’re just going to make sure that we’re thinking smartly about ways we’re going to apply the P3 into this. But I do think that P3s are necessary and required for a lot of the major projects that we want to get done in Maryland,” he said.
The meeting with Duffy also touched on replacement of the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
In the days after the bridge was struck by a loaded container ship and collapsed into the Patapsco River in March 2024, then-President Joe Biden pledged that the federal government would fund 100% of its replacement. Congress put that pledge into law in late 2024, a legal promise that Maryland lawmakers have repeatedly cited when President Donald Trump makes threats about federal funding for the project.
But in the days after the collapse, state officials also said it would cost just under $2 billion for the bridge replacement, which could be done as early as 2028. The latest estimates say the project could cost up to $5.2 billion and take until 2030, opening the door to new criticism from the Trump administration.
Duffy and Trump have also been critical of the use of contractors based on race or sex. Moore this month dismissed those complaints, saying increases in the estimated cost of the bridge replacement had nothing to do with choice of contractors and everything to do with required changes to the bridge design for safety reason, additional materials to go with those changes and higher costs of those materials as a result of tariffs and inflation.
State officials have long said that they will put any money they win in lawsuits against the owners of the Dali, the ship that struck the bridge, toward the bottom line on the project. In the joint statement after their meeting, Moore and Duffy said they “made significant progress on cost sharing … to ensure fairness” on the Key Bridge.
But that wording left some, like Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) confused.
Ferguson called the joint announcement “very promising” and said he was “looking forward to hearing the details” of the meeting. But he seemed surprised when asked about the possibility of “cost sharing” mentioned in the Moore-Duffy statement.
“I have to look more into that,” Ferguson said. “My understanding is that cost sharing is not a component of it. It’s 100% covered. So, I have to get back to you on that.”

“The good news is that the repaying, or the payment for the rebuild of the Francis Scott Key Bridge is in federal law. It’s in statute,” Ferguson said. “It is not through executive order or regulation that can be waived by the stroke of a pen and would require an act of Congress to restrict that funding.
“Should we be wary? I think we have to be. I think every assumption of what we thought or we could assume about the relationship between the state and the federal government is now up for question.”
Moore did not elaborate on the discussions regarding federal funding for the Key Bridge replacement.
“I think our teams are working very closely, and we are ensuring that in this time, we are going to be able to do something that’s not just going to make the people of the state of Maryland proud, but we’re going to do something to make the people this country proud,” Moore told reporters a day after meeting with Duffy.
It’s also not clear how the American Legion Bridge Project will progress. It is also unclear what role, if any, the Virginia Department of Transportation will have in a new American Legion Bridge.
Moore, in statements following the meeting with Duffy, described the American Legion Bridge project as “stalled.”
“We want to get this done quickly. And the thing that we both acknowledge is that when I first came on board, what we inherited were just stalled projects. Right?” Moore said. “The Purple Line was a stalled project, the ALB [American Legion Bridge] was a stalled project. And I told the secretary, and I think, you know, he agreed, we’re going to work together, because I refuse to hand off stalled projects to my successors.”
Doug Mayer, a spokesperson for Hogan, rejected Moore’s characterization of the American Legion Bridge project as stalled when he came into office. Mayer said Moore is “not misrepresenting the truth. He’s lying.”
Hogan had announced a plan to widen the bridge along with Maryland sections of Interstate 495 before Moore took office under a P3 agreement with a consortium led by Australia-based Transurban. The Transurban-led consortium was to expand the bridge and highway using managed toll lanes.
Mayer said the Hogan administration left the project “on the 99-yard line.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“He inherited a project that the former administration had spent years fighting for and had finally gotten to a place where all it needed was to go in front of the Board of Public Works,” Mayer said. “He (Moore) said he was going to pause it and get more feedback and for silly things like equity and the rest of that nonsense. What’s been going on for the last three years?”
Critics at the time complained that the proposal would benefit wealthy motorists and harm the environment. The project was similar to one Transurban constructed in Virginia.
Moore, responding to a question from a reporter, called the project a shared interest of both states and one that both states should share responsibility.
“I think for a lot of things that were done before, there was not a mutually shared both interest, ambition or incentive to be able to get the work done,” Moore said. “I will be working very closely with our friends in the Commonwealth of Virginia to make sure that the p3 that is done, that Maryland actually has a proper seat at the table when we’re looking at what those proper and those final dynamics look like.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/260116MoorePC-1024x681.jpeg,,,2026-01-26 07:57:44.827014

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The lone candidate — so far — for state comptroller is amassing a sizable war chest.
Comptroller Brooke Lierman is finishing out her first term as the state’s top tax collector. Her campaign announced this week that she raised nearly $3 million in the current cycle. She has $2.2 million in cash on hand.
“Every donation represents someone who believes we can work together to make Maryland more equitable, more resilient and more prosperous for all,” Lierman said in a statement announcing her campaign haul. “That faith helps motivate me to give my absolute best as our Comptroller and on the campaign trail every single day.”
Moore’s new federal lobbyist 
Alexis Covey-Brandt has taken over as the state’s new federal lobbyist.
Covey-Brandt took over Tuesday after Matt Verghese abruptly left his position.
“Over the past three years, Matt Verghese has played a pivotal role leading our state’s federal engagements during a volatile political climate in Washington,” the governor’s office said in a statement sent in reply to a reporter’s inquiry. “The Governor’s Office is grateful for Matt’s service in the Administration, and we wish him well as he transitions from his role.”
Verghese’s departure was effective immediately.
Covey-Brandt served as chief of staff to Rep. Steny Hoyer, a position she held for more than a decade. She left the post to become a senior adviser to Moore in June 2023.
Another race, another Democrat
After being passed over when the Democratic central committees in a three-county area chose Kevin Harris to fill the vacant District 27 Senate seat in November, Jason Fowler has decided to take his case to the voters.
Fowler filed the paperwork Friday to run for the Senate seat that includes parts of Charles, Calvert and Prince George’s counties.
Fowler, 37, who ran unsuccessfully for the District 27C House seat in Calvert County in 2018, said he “just can’t sit on the sidelines” as his district and the state experience “an affordability crisis.”
District 27 candidate Jason Fowler
“Too many people have been priced out of our state. We’re a high-taxed state with some of the most expensive housing, energy costs, grocery prices in the country,” Fowler, an attorney from Calvert County, said in a recent interview. “One of the main problems that we see in Annapolis, there is not vigorous debate over policy. It’s people just voting on bills without either reading them or thinking about the long-term effects of these policies.”
Fowler would have to unseat Harris, who was chosen overwhelmingly by the  Democratic central committees in the three counties represented by District 27, and later appointed by Gov. Wes Moore (D). Harris replaced Democrat Michael Jackson, a former Prince George’s County sheriff who left the Senate on Nov. 11 to become the Maryland State Police superintendent.
Fowler and Del. Jeffrie Long Jr. (D-Prince George’s and Calvert) were the two other candidates who sought the appointment to replace Jackson.
Trone staffs up
Turns out David Trone doesn’t just want his old job back — he wants his old staff back, too.
Trone, the former 6th District representative who lost his seat in an unsuccessful, and costly, bid for U.S. Senate in 2024, announced in December that he is running for his old job in the House. To do so, he will have to unseat Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th), who has no intention of giving up the seat, in a Democratic primary.
Trone last week announced a campaign staff that is heavy with staff from his time on Capitol Hill, including three who are coming over from McClain Delaney’s office.
Campaign manager Sonny Holding was McClain Delaney’s chief of staff, had been Trone’s deputy chief of staff and was district director to former Rep. John Delaney — McClain Delaney’s husband, who held the seat before Trone. Former Trone director of outreach Sarah Dreyer, who served until last month as McClain Delaney’s district director, will be deputy campaign manager. Sasha Galbreath, a former communications director for Trone who served in that role for McClain Delaney until October, will be senior strategic adviser to the campaign.
Trone also said that his former director of operations, Tyler Jessee, will come over from Rep. Johnny Olszewski’s (D-2nd) office to be another deputy campaign manager and Nathaniel McCarthy, who “worked for Congressman Trone since 2017 in various roles,” will be communications director and chief of staff.
Trone has already turned the race into a referendum on Trump and is already peppering the airwaves with ads touting his two impeachment votes against Trump in the president’s first term. McClain Delaney has responded with a video saying she has regularly taken on Trump over policies that harm the district and touting endorsements from virtually every top Democrat in the state.
It is also likely to be an expensive race: Trone, the millionaire owner of Total Wine & More, loaned himself almost $63 million for his unsuccessful Senate bid against Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) and has already loaned $5 million to his latest campaign, according to a year-end report with the Federal Election Commission. McClain Delaney’s year-end report has not been posted yet by the FEC.
