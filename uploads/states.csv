Former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed Saturday morning by a gunman impersonating a police officer. Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were also shot in their home in a separate incident but are expected to survive.
As of Sunday morning, a manhunt is still underway for a 57-year-old suspect, who police say left behind a manifesto and a target list that included dozens of Minnesota Democrats as well as abortion providers and pro-choice activists.
“There is no place in America for political violence of any kind,” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said in a statement. “The news of the assassination of one Minnesota lawmaker and her husband and the shooting of another lawmaker and his wife is both horrific and terrible for the entire country. Marty, the girls, and I ask that all Georgians join us in keeping their families, friends, and colleagues in our thoughts and prayers, as well as the law enforcement hunting down the madman responsible for this tragedy.”

In separate but similarly worded statements, Georgia state Senate Democrats and Republicans also condemned political violence.
“Political violence has no place in our democracy,” reads a statement from the Senate Democratic Caucus. “Gun violence has no place in our country. As we enter this weekend, we stand firm in our conviction that political violence has no place in American democracy. And we condemn any person who urges the use of force or violence to solve any political dispute.”
The Senate GOP statement contained the same sentiment but made no mention of guns.
“There is no place in America for political violence,” their statement reads. “In a constitutional republic, we settle our differences through debate, elections and the rule of law, not violence. Those who resort to the use of violence and force to advance political agendas are enemies of freedom and must be held accountable.”
Georgia’s House leaders were also unified in their condemnation of the attack.
“There is absolutely no room for this kind of violence and hatred in our nation, and we must all remain united in our commitment to condemn and root out these acts of evil whenever and wherever they occur,” said House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican.

House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley, a Columbus Democrat, also called for prayers for the families.
“Our hearts break for the families of Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, and for Senator John Hoffman and his wife, who were horrifically shot last night in a targeted attack,” Hugley said. “It is an unspeakable tragedy when those who have dedicated their lives to public service are targeted because of their positions. We must reject extremism, violence, and the politics of hate at every turn. I pray for the victims, their loved ones, and hope that law enforcement is able to swiftly bring this terrorist to justice.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The Trump administration recently terminated more than $5 million promised to South Dakota for expanded access to digital technology. That increases the administration’s total federal funding cuts impacting South Dakota state government to $23.7 million, according to the Bureau of Finance and Management.
The $5 million was awarded to the state in January under the State Digital Equity Capacity Grant Program. Digital equity initiatives increase physical access to high-speed internet by building infrastructure, teaching digital skills and ensuring access to digital devices.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration terminated the funding, part of $1.44 billion in funding nationwide, on May 9. 


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


The state Department of Labor and Regulation was in the “early stages of implementing” its program, so “there will be no impact on the public,” according to an emailed statement. Proposed activities, according to a department presentation on digital access, included creating digital equity coalitions, improving access to workforce services, providing digital literacy training to inmates, and expanding public-use and loaner digital device offerings, among other ideas.
Digital access improves access to education, employment and health care, said state Labor and Regulation Secretary Marcia Hultman in an emailed statement.
“South Dakota is a large, rural state. We have numerous avenues to continue improving digital access, even without these grants, and will continue moving forward to do so,” Hultman said.
Hultman added that her department is looking into offering a digital literacy foundational course. The department also offers Grow with Google certificates, to help people prepare for in-demand digital jobs, at no cost to the state.
The department lost an additional $658,000 recently, awarded in April 2023 under the federal Unemployment Insurance Integrity Grants program.
The state already spent one-quarter of the grant, which totaled $869,000, on a multi-factor authentication employer sign-in for the unemployment insurance portal. The department planned to use remaining funds to implement identification verification.

Nebraska’s three House members voted to advance this destructive plan that fails the people of this state, prioritizing funding for sweeping deportations of everyday working people that will separate families, and for tax breaks that benefit billionaires.

The way this package is being discussed, however, might make you think Nebraskans won’t suffer any harm from its passage. This could not be further from the truth.
The bill increases the debt to fund tax cuts for the extremely wealthy and finances the single biggest increase in history in funding for sweeping and extreme enforcement of long-outdated immigration laws.
We saw the devastating impact of harsh enforcement just last week in Omaha — with raids in Nebraska that destabilize our communities, damage our economy and, more importantly, spread unnecessary and toxic fear.
Local impact
The House bill would provide funds to expand these types of actions, which result in separating families and harming our longtime neighbors who have been part of the fabric of local communities throughout Nebraska for years, but are stuck in immigration limbo because Congress hasn’t meaningfully updated our immigration laws in nearly 40 years. This, in turn, creates destabilizing ripple effects on whole communities.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the House tax plan would give the wealthiest 1% of Nebraskans an annual tax cut of over $100,000 while the lowest-income Nebraskans would only receive $170, while that same vulnerable population also feels the hardest impacts of Congress’ food and health care cuts.
The legislation also actually adds $2.4 trillion to the deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office. So much for fiscal responsibility.
The bill includes unprecedented cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, which nearly 1 in 4 Nebraskans rely on to get health care. The budget office estimates the bill would cut Medicaid spending alone by $723 billion, the biggest cut to Medicaid in its 60-year history. These are not savings. These are cuts to coverage for people, families, and children.
Some of the reasons for this loss in coverage include harsh new work requirements, as well as new barriers and red tape, resulting in an estimated 45,000 Nebraskans losing Medicaid.
Real costs
The bill also would require Nebraska to pay for a portion of the cost of SNAP for the first time, which means new costs ranging from $16 million to $82 million in the state budget. Nebraska would be forced to find a way to pay the cost, cut food supports dramatically or opt out of SNAP entirely.

At least 29,000 Nebraskans are at risk of losing at least some of their food assistance, including children and families who would have to follow strict and unnecessary work requirements.
These are examples of how the bill passes the buck to Nebraska to make the hard decisions. But make no mistake: The legislation passed by the House would lead to losses in health care access and food assistance. Congress is simply shifting the responsibility to state lawmakers to decide who gets thrown from the lifeboat.
In short, we are being told a story that the legislation passed by the House harms no one, when the truth is that the bill turns our values upside down: tax breaks for those who don’t need them, separating families and cutting from health care and food supports. Our Nebraska leaders in Congress should make better choices for their constituents.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Gary Waugh clutched the 13-folded flag in its frame as he stood among more than 1,000 people gathered on a hot, smoggy Saturday afternoon at Patterson Park in Baltimore for a political rally.
Waugh, 71, said the flag represented his father, William, a World War II vet who he said would have been “disgusted” by the Trump administration. Waugh brought the folded flag so his father could be a part of the more than 2,000 “No Kings” rallies nationwide to protest the Trump administration.
“I figured he would have wanted to come down and see what we were doing today,” Waugh said.
The sizable crowd in Patterson Park was just one of more than 40 in Maryland Saturday that were held in city halls, park and highway overpasses, among the thousands of anti-Trump demonstrations across the United States opposing the president and his policies.
The peaceful protests were deliberately scheduled to counter President Donald Trump’s (R) military parade in Washington, D.C. to mark the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army’s founding. Saturday also happened to be Trump’s 79th birthday.
The conflicting events led to signs, chants and speakers at the No Kings rallies that challenged who the “real” patriots were, arguing that it was those who were participating in peaceful protests Saturday against the administration.

Several protesters, including Waugh, saw the military parade not as an honor to American troops or a recognition of Flag Day, but as an ego-boost for the president.
“It’s an abomination,” Waugh said of the military parade. “It’s horrible, it’s not what our country is about. It’s all about him. It’s fueling his ego at my expense, and it’s just obscene as far as I’m concerned.”
Indivisible, a national organization dedicated to opposing Trump and his policies, said that the protests are in response to Trump’s “authoritarian overreach,” which includes rising numbers of warrantless immigration raids, cuts to federal funding and jobs, reductions to health care spending and more.
Veronica Koch, 28, attended the Baltimore rally dressed in a costume loosely inspired by John Adams — an outfit she had previously prepared back in October for a Founding Fathers-themed party.
Her costume may have been light-hearted, but her message, that she “absolutely loved America,” was serious.
“I love our people, and I want America to be a place that is welcoming, which is something that we literally wrote our Declaration [of Independence] about,” she said.
“I support our military. I do not support the hatred that we have become,” she said. “I don’t love what our flag has come to represent … I feel like we’re kind of trying to reclaim it.”
No Kings protests around the nation denounce Trump’s actions

Signs, chants and speeches given in Baltimore targeted several Trump administrations policies. Top of mind for several protesters was the increasing activity of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Maryland and elsewhere.
Jontadria Davison, 27, said that some of her Latin and Hispanic coworkers at the restaurant where she works have become more fearful under the Trump administration.
“They’re all scared. My coworker was scared to take her daughter to school the other day, because she’s worried that ICE is going to come get her,” she said. “It’s a dark time for everybody, so they’re not playing.”
People attending a rally in Rockville earlier that day shared similar concerns.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who spoke at both the Baltimore and Rockville protests, referenced the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrigo Garcia to El Salvador as an example of Trump’s “lawless” approach to governing.
“If Donald Trump can trample all over his [Abrego Garcia’s] constitutional rights, he can trample over all of your constitutional rights,” Van Hollen said.
“The people are being tested by a man who is an autocrat. A man who does not believe in democracy. A man who does not believe in the Constitution,” Van Hollen said. “So, it’s great to see the people – ‘We the People’ – are gathered to make sure we protect our country and our Constitution.”

Linda Graziani, a Montgomery County public school teacher, felt that the millions in taxpayer dollars necessary to put on the military parade would be better spent elsewhere, including in education and health care. She was one of thousands who lined the sidewalk of Rockville Pike Saturday morning.
“He’s … taking money away from Medicaid, taking away money from the people who need it and giving it to the people who don’t need it with tax cuts,” Graziani said of Trump. Reports say that the parade is estimated to cost about $45 million.
Sylvia Greenberg, 56, drove from Gaithersburg to attend the Rockville rally with her daughter, Evlin. She said the Trump administration’s “centralization of power, ignoring our checks and balances,” is “just not American.”
“Which one is more American? People standing up for what they feel is right or a show of tanks and guns with somebody who’s centralizing power for himself?” she asked. “I think we’re the more patriotic.”

Sign up for their newsletter here.
BIRMINGHAM — When Jilisa Milton received the grant termination letter, she wasn’t surprised. She suspected this day would come.
The language the Greater Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution (GASP) had used in its application to the Environmental Protection Agency had been clear. “We’re talking about helping a community,” Milton, GASP’s executive director, said last week, “where Black people have been disproportionately impacted.”
Black residents had breathed heavily polluted air from a nearby coke plant for decades, and their neighborhoods had been declared a federal hazardous waste Superfund site after it was determined that waste soil laced with arsenic, lead and benzo(a)pyrene, a human carcinogen, from several nearby coke plants had been spread around their homes as yard fill.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In light of this history and continued industrial pollution, GASP had obtained a $75,000 air monitoring grant from the Biden EPA in 2023.
Milton received the letter earlier this month from officials in President Donald Trump’s EPA terminating the grant because it no longer aligned with the agency’s priorities.
“I knew at some point they would notice the language of our grant,” Milton said, in that it made reference to services intended to help Black people.
Still, she said she doesn’t regret the way GASP characterized the situation on the ground in north Birmingham—that the need for air monitoring stemmed from the city’s history of corporate exploitation of majority-Black workers and residents.
Growing up in Birmingham, Milton said her grandparents often discussed the legacy of workers in the Magic City—so-nicknamed because of the seemingly supernatural economic boom spurred by steel production following the end of the Civil War.
“The majority of these workers were Black, and we can see the disparate impact that still has today,” Milton said. “And it’s really important for Birmingham to talk about our legacy and our history.”
Sanitizing that history, then, to comply with the Trump administration’s stated opposition to all things DEI and environmental justice—as if they were the same thing, just because they both often involve Black people—doesn’t sit well with her.
“I think the narrative work is gone then,” Milton said. “And we have to think about history so we don’t live it again.”
The grant, awarded through EPA’s small grants program, was set to fund GASP’s efforts to train residents in using air monitoring equipment to help establish a community air monitoring program, allowing those in north Birmingham access to critical information about the pollutants filling their lungs every day.
In addition to what is now the 35th Avenue Superfund site, encompassing the neighborhoods of Collegeville, Harriman Park and Fairmont, north Birmingham remains home to several polluters, leaving its residents in the 90th percentile for particulate matter, according to EJ Screen, a government tool also recently shuttered by the Trump administration.
That context of present and past pollution was what made securing funds for air monitoring so important, Milton said, giving residents an opportunity to learn more about the continued impact of industry on their health.
“For decades, residents of North Birmingham and other historically marginalized communities have been forced to live in the shadow of toxic industries with little support or transparency,” Milton wrote in a statement after receiving the termination letter. “The grant made it possible for us to monitor and document the pollution people live with everyday. Revoking this support sends a message that the health of Black, Brown, and low-income communities in Alabama is disposable.”
In its letter, EPA officials said the agency no longer supported the grant’s objectives.
“The purpose of this communication is to notify you that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is hereby terminating Assistance Agreement No. EQ-02D22522 awarded to GASP,” the letter said. “This EPA Assistance Agreement is terminated in its entirety effective immediately on the grounds that the award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

GASP’s isn’t the only environmental justice effort in Alabama nixed by federal officials. In April, Trump announced the termination of what the administration termed an “illegal DEI” settlement aimed at addressing sewage issues in the state’s black belt that have left its majority-Black residents sometimes unable to flush their own toilets.
The agreement, reached under the Biden Administration, required the state’s Department of Public Health to improve sanitation efforts in the region. It’s still unclear what that termination will ultimately mean on the ground.
In the end, Milton said the impact of the administration’s decision to terminate the north Birmingham air monitoring grant is racist.
“Look at the way they talk about environmental justice,” she said of administration officials. “They say it’s illegal to address these issues. So you hear the things they say, and it’s reasonable to discern from that that the impact is racist, and that what they’re doing is intentional.”
People of all races are forced to face the consequences of polluted air and water, Milton emphasized, but ignoring the reality that people of color have borne and continue to bear the brunt of industrial exploitation isn’t helpful. In fact, she explained, doing so could undermine the relationship organizations like hers have built with residents of color living through the impacts of pollution every single day.
“I don’t want to sacrifice the trust we have in communities that want to be heard because they notice that we start to change the way we talk about these issues,” she said. “Because they are the most important stakeholders. They’re who we’re here to serve.”
Moving forward, GASP plans to appeal the termination with EPA officials, Milton said, though she suspects the agency is unlikely to change its mind. If that’s the case, the nonprofit will do what they’ve always done—look to individual donors to fill in the gaps. It’s work that can’t be abandoned, Milton said. Not if she can help it.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bluestone-Coke-Facility-for-June-15-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-15 08:59:03.009701

June 14, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz VelizSeveral thousand people of all ages and backgrounds packed one of the oldest parks in Southwest Detroit on Saturday, June 14, in the early afternoon, participating in the protest called “No Kings Day” convened by local social movements and organizations as part of a nationwide movement.
The nationwide protests, mainly against Trump’s presidency, took place on the same day as the military parade in Washington D.C. to celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday, but also Trump’s 79th birthday. Ranging between $25 million to $45 million in cost, the military parade gathered nearly 7,000 soldiers and 150 vehicles, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, as well as military flyovers from 50 aircraft. 
The Detroit gathering was one of dozens held across Michigan and more than 1,500 nationally, gathering from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands in major cities. Other Michigan cities hosting protests included Flint, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Ferndale, and even as far away as Ironwood in the western Upper Peninsula.
Pro-immigration and anti-Trump administration slogans in English and Spanish were heard all across Clark Park as more demonstrators continued coming to the rally, filling the surroundings as far as the eye could see.
Just minutes after the scheduled start of the rally, a scuffle broke out between motorcyclists and some demonstrators, shortly after a group of bikers, members of the Detroit Highwaymen, arrived, claiming they were there to ensure order in support of the nation. Brief moments of shoving and shouting followed the altercation before volunteers, part of the organization, stepped in to calm the situation.

Police arrived moments later to help disperse the crowd. No arrests were reported.
As thousands of attendees raised their voices, a wide range of concerns and causes rose with them. While many of the chants expressed strong opposition to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and federal policies impacting undocumented immigrants, calling for Detroit to become a sanctuary city, demonstrators also raised their voices in support of the LGBTQ+ community and protest of what they say is a genocide in Gaza.
Several speakers, including local activist leaders and Democratic Michigan politicians, gave their words in English and Spanish to the attendees.
Among the speakers, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) shared passionate comments to the public, expressing her support for the Detroit community in resisting the current federal administration and its latest policies impacting Detroit’s community and across the state.  
“When I look at all of you, you don’t have to have a ZIP code in Detroit to understand that fascism hurts all of us. Many of you have your stance in why you’re here,” Tlaib told the crowd “Maybe immigrant rights. Maybe Free Free Palestine. Maybe LGBTQ. Maybe it’s fighting to make sure workers are protected. Maybe saying you will not dismantle education in our country. Whatever issue, the more we are connected, the more dangerous we become to this administration.”

Tlaib also emphasized support for immigrant families affected by federal border agents, mentioning Maykol Bogoya-Duarte, an 18-year-old Colombian high school student who was arrested by ICE and has lost his appeal to stay in the country; consequently, he will be deported soon.
“You showing up like this to show that we’re going to resist; them kidnapping Maykol; them kidnapping our family members; them ignoring Supreme Court decisions; them going around Congress to go to war; all of these fascist, unconstitutional, unlawful decisions only can be fought when we resist in the streets,” Tlaib said.
As the rally continued, some counter-protesters approached carrying flags and signs, sparking minor confrontations involving shoving and insults while they walked through the crowd. Volunteer protesters helped to disperse and avoid confrontations.
Among them, holding the American flag, was Andre Williams, 24, who expressed support for current ICE activities, claiming that undocumented immigrants should be deported to prioritize the American labor force. He also made remarks against the LGBTQ+ community.
“I’m an American who is tired of seeing people supporting illegal immigration. Illegal immigration is a big problem in this country.” Said Williams. “You’ve got big corporations that use illegal immigrants as economic pawns.

Williams was repeatedly surrounded by volunteers and escorted out of the rally. They held hands around him and gently pushed toward the edges of the crowd, sparking tense moments filled with shouting and insults from demonstrators.
A community also built by immigrants
A few days earlier, on Wednesday morning, pro-immigrant activist groups reported that five or six individuals, four of them believed to be Venezuelan, were detained following the dismissal of their immigration cases in court. That same day, demonstrators gathered outside the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building in the morning and later in the afternoon at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office.
An ICE spokesman told the Detroit Free Press that ICE officers can make civil immigration arrests near courthouses if they have credible information and as long as local laws don’t prohibit it.
The activists stated that these practices against immigrants are intensifying in Detroit.
A few blocks away from where these activists rallied, Ofelia Torres, 29, a Detroit resident, arrived at the “No Kings Day” protest carrying a Mexican-American flag. She mentioned that her grandparents helped build the city after immigrating directly to Michigan in the 1970s.
“In the 1970s, my grandparents were immigrant workers from Mexico who helped build the Renaissance Center, which is the largest landmark in this city, this border town that people often forget. So that’s the reason why my parents, my siblings, and I were born and raised here,” Torres said.
“Every time I see downtown, I know this city was built by my grandparents and so many others,” Torres emphasized.

A few steps from her, holding a Mexican flag and a sign that read “Orgullo Latino”, which means “Latino Pride” in English, followed by “Every damn day,” Leonardo Enriquez, 23, a Detroit resident, shared that he is the son of Mexican immigrants who came from Guadalajara more than fifteen years ago and have been working ever since.
“It’s sad to see that he’s afraid to go out and be outside because of everything that’s happening, and he’s just doing what he can to support his family. I’m here because my mom and dad couldn’t make it today,I wanted to represent them,” Enriquez said.

Around 4 pm, after the speeches ended, attendees began to march from Clark Park to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office. The American flag and flags from different countries, such as Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Argentina, were waved along with signs through Mexicantown streets and Michigan Avenue by protesters as they chanted and marched.
Marching at the front of the crowd, Silvana Palma, an Argentine immigrant, held and waved the light blue and white flag with the sun at its center. She shared that she arrived 15 years ago and has lived in Detroit ever since.
“I just hope things work out for us, and that we’re given the same right to live here as anyone else,” Palma said.

The protesters approached the outside of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office where they held a rally, listening to speeches and chanting slogans against ICE. Without any other incidents involving counter-protesters or the police, a few minutes before 6, the protesters walked back to Clark Park where they ended the march.

More than two years before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus, Martha White refused to give up her seat on a city bus in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Soon, another Black woman joined her. 
The bus driver threatened to arrest them, but when the Rev. T.J. Jemison, pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church, arrived, he informed the driver of a recently passed city ordinance that meant White hadn’t violated the law. As a result, white bus drivers began a strike. When that ended days later, Jemison and others began a boycott. 
Jemison had long been upset about the fact that although Black riders made up 80% of passengers, they had to stand in bus aisles while seats remained empty: “I thought that was just out of order; that was just cruel.” 
Thousands attended the nightly meetings, and their numbers continued to grow. Money collected at meetings went to pay for gas for providing rides. The boycott ended with the compromise that other than the two side front seats for white riders and a long rear seat for Black riders, the remaining seats would be occupied on a first-come, first-served basis. After that success, a young Martin Luther King Jr. came and visited Jemison.

Vermonters asked for tax relief, not a complete transformation of the education system. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont fathers: This Father’s Day, let’s commit to saving rural Vermont.","This commentary is by 17 Vermont fathers and members of the Rural School Community Alliance. Their names are listed below the text.
As Vermont dads of children attending Vermont schools and members of the Rural School Community Alliance, we’re used to showing up for our kids: on the sidelines, at bedtime, in the school pickup line and around the dinner table. Today, we’re showing up in a different way: to urge lawmakers to stand up for our kids and our communities as they consider final changes to the education transformation bill.
We love Vermont for many of the same reasons we choose to raise our kids here: the tight-knit communities, the open spaces, the chance to know your neighbors and the powerful bond between rural schools and the towns they serve. But right now, that way of life is at risk.

The Rural School Community Alliance represents school districts, supervisory unions and municipal leaders in more than 100 Vermont towns and villages along with numerous supporters from non-member towns throughout Vermont. Rural community schools are not just places of learning; they are cornerstones of civic life, economic resilience and family stability. As the future of public education in our state hangs in the balance, we ask the Legislature to keep five key priorities in mind:
Transparency around the funding formula
Before any new funding system is enacted, Vermonters deserve a clear, honest accounting of how it will affect our communities, property taxes and school budgets. We can’t make decisions in the dark and our lawmakers shouldn’t either.
Protecting democratic engagement
No school should be closed without a vote of the people. Period. Community input is essential to maintaining trust and ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of kids, families and taxpayers. A full educational and community impact study should be required before any closure is even considered.
Guidelines not mandates
Don’t tie the hands of education professionals. Apply guidelines, not mandates for class, school and district size. Especially in rural Vermont, flexibility is needed to maintain optimal learning environments.
Respect for what works in rural governance
Supervisory unions strike a critical balance in Vermont, allowing for collaboration and efficiency without sacrificing local voice and oversight. Any governance changes must build on what works for rural schools, not impose a one-size-fits-all model that erodes accountability, weakens community bonds and likely only costs more money.
Real community voice in redistricting
The redistricting task force must listen to the people. Community-developed proposals should be seriously reviewed and, where possible, integrated into final decisions. The best solutions will come from the ground up, not the top down.
Vermonters asked for tax relief, not a complete transformation of the education system. After years of pandemic recovery, workforce shortages and skyrocketing health care costs, this is not the time for sweeping, untested reforms that put rural kids and families at risk. Proposals to further consolidate our schools, without strong Vermont-based evidence of cost savings or academic gains, are deeply concerning.
Forced consolidation will hollow out our towns, reduce civic participation and make it even harder for young families to stay in, or move to, rural Vermont. For us, this isn’t just policy. This is personal. Because when the local school closes, the town often fades with it.
This Father’s Day, we’re not asking for cards or neckties. We’re asking for leadership that values rural communities and keeps Vermont’s children at the center of every decision.
We urge legislators to do right by our kids and stand with rural families. Let’s build a future where every Vermont child, no matter their ZIP code, has access to a strong, vibrant community school.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sultana Khan: When it is hard to know what to believe in, believe in the power of connection. And summer camp..","This commentary is by Sultana Khan of Randolph, executive director of YWCA Vermont and Camp Hochelaga.


Right now, so many of Vermont’s small, wonderful communities are struggling to combat divisiveness, financial hardship, the impacts of climate change and so much more. During times of uncertainty, it often seems easier to turn inward than to reach out. But when it is hard to know what to believe in, believe in the power of connection. And summer camp. 
Summer camp is the antidote to so many of the systemic causes that erode young people’s self-esteem and sense of adventure. 
In my new role as the executive director of YWCA Vermont and Camp Hochelaga, an inclusive girls+ camp on the shores of Lake Champlain, I am once again immersed in the joy and wonder that is camp.
Summer camps have rich, historic traditions of creating spaces where young people can experience the awe of a world where they are not constrained by the rules society creates to keep them in their place. Where they can build deep, lasting relationships with other youth who have also been seeking a place where they can be their weirdest, most authentic selves. Where they can see models of kindness, acceptance and generosity. 
Camp can be a place where you are able to more clearly see your part in our natural world. As humans have created technologies that make our lives more comfortable (and with climate change, more liveable), we have distanced ourselves from the impact of those technologies. By controlling the climates within our homes, we have made the outdoors a place to be tolerated rather than understanding that the outdoors is our home. 
Camp Hochelaga is a rustic camp — our campers and counselors sleep in cabins that don’t have electricity. With the windows open, you can hear the scurrying and chittering of the creatures that share our spectacular environment on the shores of Lake Champlain. You can observe deer, foxes, snakes, eagles, fish, chipmunks and so many other inhabitants who share our earth. Sometimes, significantly less pleasantly, you can also smell skunks.
Understanding humanity’s power and responsibility to care for the world we think of as solely our own is essential to supporting the next generation in fighting against the destruction of our planet through relentless consumption. 
More importantly, camp is a place of connection. At a time when Americans feel increasingly isolated and lonely, camp offers a place for girls to bond over experiences and values that social media seeks to undermine through conformity and a sustained focus on materialism. Camp offers an alternative proposal to finding happiness in owning things that impress others. Camp offers a way of living that prioritizes community over consumption.
At camp, you can wear your beloved ratty shirt without teasing. You can produce weird plays that make everyone laugh (or cry!), or sing off-key to songs that have been sung for more than 100 years. 
You can cry about the world and find a loving shoulder of someone who has been exactly where you are, trying to find brightness amid the challenges of life. You can jump off a dock for the first time, holding the hand of a friend who has done it before, encouraged by the cheers of your cabinmates. 
At camp, you can learn what it means to be yourself while being a part of a greater whole. At camp, you can live a full, joyful life, supported by adults who know how valuable it is to be told you can do anything with a little hard work and a supportive community. 
At camp, you can learn to change the world.

The Girl and the Sky
Fiona Bock, 15, Glover
A little girl looked up to the sky – 
“So big and far away, it’s like that, why? 
I don’t know why you are 
The way that you are,  
But you have far, shining stars 
And I’m but a trying cry.” 

The sky bent down to the ground where she sat
And murmured softly, “You’re but a lass,
So young with such promise,
I’ve seen it go by.
But you’re here right now,
So look at the flowers, 
Don’t cry.”

“Isn’t the world changing so fast?
Haven’t the days we’ve known
Almost wholly gone past?
Where are the bluejays, the startling colors?
Where is the wonder, not thunder, the sunburns of summer?”

“Aye,” cried the sky, now that you say,
“I’m choking on smoke,
I’m beat up and broke,
I’m torn and I’m worn 
And I’m shorn of my hope!”

“But you still are blue, e’en behind the clouds
Your colors are true, your face is so proud!
Your tears give me life. 
I’m sorry your strife
Is cause of my parents and grandparents and human amount!”

“It’s not one, but it’s all,”
Said the sky with a sigh,
“It’s not just one person’s fault,
But the shared blame is the shame
Which prevents us from acting!
You’re worse if you’re silent 
For you’ll find hurt by your neighbor’s violence!”

In the rain that poured down,
The girl wept with the sky, 
The drains drank up the water 
And tears fell from her eye. 

“What now, my sky, where can I go
When the entire earth is 
Sunk to death row?
How can I make fire to feed a starving world
When fire is stolen and used to make gold
That the true people won’t see,
That will kill the honeybees,
And without honey, without sugar,
Without life or love, 
Without wonder we plunder.
I’m so sad, sky, I’ve fallen under!”

“But these are happy tears,
I have not fear 
But hope! 
I will profess my hope
For you!”

So she danced in the rain from the sky,
As a glimpse of sun veined the tear-trodden earth,
And the girl and the sky danced together.

(Andrew Roth | Michigan Advance)
This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra and Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th. Meet Shefali and Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Almost three years after the fall of Roe v. Wade made way for near-total abortion bans, state lawmakers are weighing whether to offer more specific guidance about when doctors can perform abortions in a medical crisis.
Texas, Kentucky and Tennessee all passed laws this year ostensibly clarifying the scope of their abortion bans, a reaction to climbing sepsis rates and harrowing stories of patients who have suffered or died preventable deaths. Since June 2022, lawmakers in at least nine states have introduced such bills.
But doctors, attorneys and policy experts say that the laws being enacted will not solve the problems health providers have been forced to navigate since the end of Roe: The risk of being punished has deterred physicians, hospitals and health systems from providing consistent care, even when it is needed.
“The problem with these clarifying laws is they don’t expand access under the law, they don’t change the definitions, and they don’t remove the legislative interference in the practice of medicine,” said Molly Meegan, chief legal officer and general counsel to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
In Texas, a bill that awaits Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature ostensibly clarifies when the state’s near-total abortion ban allows for the procedure, saying explicitly that physicians do not need to wait until a patient is in imminent danger of dying to perform an abortion. The bill also requires training for doctors and lawyers on the state’s abortion law.
But lawmakers have made clear that the bill, crafted in consultation with Texas-based health professionals and abortion opponents, does not introduce new exceptions; Texas’ ban does not allow for abortions in cases of rape, incest or fatal fetal anomaly. And if enacted, it would codify a Texas Supreme Court decision that found that the state’s ban still applied even in cases with complications that could threaten a pregnant person’s health.. Such was  the case for Dallas woman Kate Cox, who experienced amniotic fluid leaking and cramping — which create the risk of bacterial infection — after discovering a likely-fatal fetal anomaly in her pregnancy.
Some former abortion patients whose lives were endangered because of delayed or denied care, including several who challenged the Texas abortion ban, said they fear Senate Bill 31 may not address situations like theirs.
Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after being denied an abortion when experiencing a life-threatening condition called preterm premature rupture of membrane, said at a legislative hearing on the bill that it likely doesn’t provide the clarity she would have needed.
“It is unclear whether SB 31 would have prevented my trauma and preserved my fertility had it existed in 2022, and I find that problematic,” Zurawski said. She only received care after she developed sepsis.
Clarification bills can have mixed support in legislatures. Local physicians might back tweaks to exemption language if they see it as potentially lifesaving for their patients. Some anti-abortion advocates might also favor changes if the legislation can address certain medical emergencies that they believe fall outside of a state’s ban, such as ectopic pregnancies or preterm premature rupture of membranes.
But not all anti-abortion advocates or Republican lawmakers within these statehouses support even a small clarification.
“I think in all these cases, lawmakers are being pulled in different directions by these different constituencies,” said Mary Ziegler, an abortion law historian at the University of California, Davis. “The bills themselves are kind of muddy, because they’re trying to be different things to different people.”
The end result are clarification laws that remain unclear to physicians and their employing hospitals and health systems, who can still face high penalties for violating an abortion ban.
“When the law isn’t clear, physicians don’t intervene,” Ziegler said. “You’re not going to be willing to gamble your liberty and your medical license on an uncertain interpretation of the law.”
In Kentucky, doctors vocally opposed a Republican-backed bill that supporters said would help health professionals understand when they can provide abortions. Like in Texas, the state’s ban only allows abortion when it is necessary to save a pregnant person’s life. The clarification bill listed specific conditions that would qualify for an exception to the ban — such as sepsis, hemorrhage or ectopic pregnancy — despite concern from doctors that a delineated list wouldn’t be able to predict every possible situation where an abortion might save someone’s life.
Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed the bill in March, calling gaps in the law “literally a matter of life and death.” The state’s legislature, where the GOP holds a supermajority, voted days later to override him.
“It’s hard to create this laundry list of, ‘This is OK, this is not OK,’ because unfortunately, medicine is something with a bunch of gray areas,” said Dr. Caitlin Thomas, an OB-GYN in Louisville.
In Georgia — where pregnant, brain-dead woman Adriana Smith remains on life-support until she can give birth later this summer, and where the death of Amber Thurman was attributed to the confusion created by the state’s abortion ban — some lawmakers have asked physicians whether a clarification might allow doctors to provide abortions when the pregnancy threatens a patient’s life, possibly by listing specific conditions that qualify for an exception.
“We encouraged them not to, and said that would not be helpful,” said Dr. Neesha Verma, an Atlanta-based OB-GYN. “The more and more prescriptive you make these laws, the less space there is for clinical judgment.”
Following a case filed by seven Tennessee patients who had been denied abortions under the state’s ban, lawmakers in that state passed a law this year meant to clarify that, under the state’s ban, abortions could be performed in cases of preterm prelabor rupture of membrane or severe preeclampsia, but that the exception did not include mental health emergencies. Mental health conditions including substance use disorder, depression and confirmed or probably suicide are the largest single cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the state, according to a 2022 report.
The interest in clarifying bans — including from some lawmakers who oppose abortion — “is a response to where we know the public is and the fact that we know the public is generally supportive of abortion access and also has been presented with these terrible preventable cases since Dobbs,” said Kimya Forouzan, who tracks state policy for the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit abortion research organization.
That ambiguity was on display in a Texas case last year. A state judge held that the state’s abortion law exception permitted Cox to have an abortion when her doctors discovered the anomaly in her pregnancy. But the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, swiftly intervened, threatening legal action against any health care provider that performed an abortion on Cox. Cox ultimately left the state to terminate her pregnancy.
Michele Goodwin, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine and author of “Policing the Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood,” said state officials can do more to ensure health providers know their legal rights.
“It would be credible for states’ attorneys generals and the prosecutors who are conservative to immediately issue statements of clarity, saying that they are opposed to these kinds of conditions, that they will not prosecute,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AMR0780-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-15 08:00:03.789795

Some, like Jackson and Greenville, opt to instead celebrate Juneteenth.","Mississippians who are uncomfortable with the state recognizing Confederate Memorial Day as a holiday have options.
The state’s about 300 municipalities and 82 counties do not have to recognize the holiday. They can replace it with another holiday, such as the June 19 nationally observed Juneteenth, which commemorates the freedom of African Americans, or with a Mardi Gras holiday or with various other holidays.
The Mississippi legal code recognizes 10 holidays ranging from the traditional ones like Christmas, Thanksgiving and Veterans Day. The state honors Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert E. Lee on the same day in January. And baffling to many, the state has a Confederate Memorial Day holiday in April.
Efforts have been ongoing for years by many to replace Confederate Memorial Day, which by the definition of what the confederates were trying to accomplish commemorates slavery.
State leaders have rebuffed efforts to replace the holiday. Incumbent Gov. Tate Reeves and governors before him have taken the additional step of proclaiming April as Confederate Heritage Month.
But the state code surprisingly provides a reprieve for those wanting to be more inclusive or to at least not recognize Confederate Memorial Day. The law allows counties and municipalities to replace one of the state holidays, with the exception of Veterans Day and Martin Luther King Jr./Robert E. Lee Day, with one of their own.
Many cities do that. For instance, the city of Hattiesburg recognizes Good Friday instead of Confederate Memorial Day. The city of Greenville replaces Confederate Memorial Day with Juneteenth. Back in 2022, the Jackson City Council replaced Confederate Memorial Day with Juneteenth.
There are multiple issues surrounding a holiday. First of all, it is a day that most of the public offices recognizing the holiday are closed and many public employees are off.
The federal government, for example, recognizes Juneteenth as an official holiday, resulting in federal services being curtailed. That also is the case in Mississippi cities like Greenville and Jackson which recognize the holiday in lieu of Confederate Memorial Day.
Not surprisingly, the federal government does not recognize Confederate Memorial Day.
Besides a holiday being a day off for some, a holiday also is a symbol of what we believe as a society.
As state Sen. Derrick Simmons, D-Greenville, wrote in a recent Mississippi Today Ideas essay, “Holidays are public statements of our values. They are moments when a state, through official sanction, tells its citizens: ‘This is what we believe is worthy of honor.’”
Simmons has worked in the Mississippi Legislature to try to replace Confederate Memorial Day. He has been unsuccessful thus far.
But his twin brother, Errick Simmons, who is mayor of Greenville, was able to eliminate Confederate Memorial Day thanks to the state law giving cities and counties the option to replace one holiday.
Errick Simmons recently said, “The city of Greenville will never honor or celebrate Confederate Memorial Day — now or forever. As a city rooted in resilience, progress and unity, we categorically reject any celebration of a past rooted in oppression, division and racial injustice. As long as I am mayor of this great city, we will never honor or celebrate it.”
But the state of the Simmons brothers’ birth continues to do so.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/06155046/Juneteenth-at-Smith-Park5.jpg,,,2025-06-15 08:00:03.789795

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on June 12.
After staggering levels of growth at the onset of the pandemic, skier visits in Vermont leveled off this season, but the industry is still booming, according to discussions and presentations from Ski Vermont’s annual meeting at Sugarbush Resort last week.
Ski industry stakeholders discussed several topics at the event, and Ski Vermont — the public face of the Vermont Ski Areas Association — released its highly anticipated skier data for last season, figures that are difficult to find anywhere else and all but impossible on a resort-by-resort basis.
Vermont saw 4.16 million alpine skiers this season, a 1.1 percent increase from last year and a 6.2 percent increase over the last ten years, according to Ski Vermont. This year’s percent increase paled in comparison to figures from 2021 and 2022, which means visitation is leveling off, but resorts felt more prepared for big crowds than three years ago, according to Molly Mahar, Ski Vermont’s president.
Vermont remains the top ski state in New England and fourth largest in the country, according to figures from Ski Vermont. Vermont led New England in increased skier visits by less than one percent but trailed the national average increase of 1.7 percent.
In a lesser sung tune, Vermont’s cross-country ski areas saw a surge in visitation that outpaced alpine resorts. Heavy snowfall and consistently cold weather benefitted cross-country ski operations, which saw a 37 percent increase in visitation, or 322,353 total skiers. Those figures are a significant improvement from last year, when visitation fell by 50 percent due to inclement weather and poor conditions.
David Rye, director of the Outdoor Center at the von Trapp Family Lodge and Resort, agreed it was a good year for cross-country skiing. The trails at von Trapp were open for 110 days this year with 100 percent of terrain open for 62 consecutive days, he said.
Rye didn’t give specific numbers on visitation, but said the number of skier rentals, visits and ski school lessons all increased significantly.
Alpine skier visitation took a hit toward the end of the season as policies and rhetoric from President Donald Trump’s administration deterred Canadians from visiting Vermont resorts, according to Mahar.
Canadians account for up to 50 percent of skier visits in northern Vermont, according to Ski Vermont. Resorts like Jay Peak shouldered a brunt of that impact, but additional areas in the northern tier, including Stowe Mountain Resort, Smugglers’ Notch and Bolton Valley, were also impacted, Mahar said.
Ski Vermont can’t do much about Trump’s rhetoric, but the organization is working harder than ever to maintain advertising in Canada, she added.
Stowe wasn’t the only town playing in powder this year either. Vermont saw an average snowfall of 218 inches, a 19-inch increase from last year, and 35 inches above the 10-year average. As a result, resorts averaged 117 operating days, although this is slightly below the 10-year average of 123 days.
Beyond the numbers, participants at last week’s event dove into a lengthy discussion about the Vermont’s ski industry workforce, which ranged from the various education programs around the state preparing workers for jobs the ski industry to the impact Trump’s immigration policies may have on international workers at ski resorts.
Mahar estimated that out of 13,000 workers in Vermont’s ski industry, around 1,000 are international, and 10 resorts, including Stowe Mountain Resort, employ international workers. She said the impact of losing those workers would be significant.

Palieri’s songs seem perfect for the protest line; like folk singers of the past, his pro-labor music works responds to a volatile political climate.

Chelsea Burton is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
In the home of Rik Palieri, a country-roots and folk singer living in Hinesburg, the walls are filled with instruments: Native American flutes, guitars, banjos and more. They listen to — and help him express —  the songs, sounds and stories of his life.
From East Brunswick, New Jersey, Palieri grew up listening. In hearing performers at a nearby college campus and songs around the kitchen table, he developed a love for music early on.
“I was young and just brimming with a love for folk music that was just driving my friends crazy,” Palieri said. 
So, at age 15, he picked up famed folk singer Pete Seeger’s book, “How to Play the 5-String Banjo.”
That decision was the first of his lifelong career in music. Palieri ended up befriending his teacher in the 1970s. The two jammed together the first time they met — a fitting interaction that kicked off a friendship rooted in music.
Palieri has kept the letters the two sent each other over the years, and he even has a picture of Seeger’s banjo framed in his house.
He’s honored his idol on the road, too. In 2013, Palieri and folk singer George Mann toured across the Rust Belt, through the Mountain West and along the West Coast, performing “for unions and union people,” as Mann put it in an account from that year. 
The tour was a recreation of one from 1941 by the Almanac Singers, a loose group featuring Seeger and Woody Guthrie as mainstays, along with musicians such as Cisco Houston and Bess Lomax Hawes.
Outside of Seeger, Palieri has found support from his wife of 33 years, Marianna Holzer. The two live in a wooden home in Hinesburg with their big white dog, Dolina, and a vast collection of instruments — two favorites are his guitars, Pearl and Lucky.
In Hinesburg, Palieri hosts a monthly jam at the Carpenter-Carse Library, along with the Great Vermont Barn Dance Show. 
“Getting people together and playing music — that’s what it’s all about,” he said.
But Palieri’s impact has extended far outside Vermont. Inspired by the music scene proliferating in Burlington, the singer started his television show, “Songwriter’s Notebook,” in 1999 on Vermont Community Access Media (now part of the Media Factory). It features musicians of any form, from songwriters to instrument-makers. 
The Library of Congress contacted Palieri 10 years later, inducting his show into the archives of the American Folklife Center in Washington, D.C. His honors also include a 2023 lifetime achievement award from the New Jersey Folk Festival, which is in its 50th year in his home state. 
Palieri was most excited to talk about his most recent album, “Hands of Time,” which came out on streaming platforms toward the end of last year.  
He recorded it in a house where once stood Philo Records — an old recording studio based out of Ferrisburgh. The inspiration came from iconic troubadour Utah Phillips — an old folk friend and mentor of Palieri’s who had recorded at the studio in the 1970s.
Phillips lived in an old railroad car nearby. About a decade after Phillips’ death in 2008, family, friends and folk fans held a concert to raise enough money for the old flanger car to be moved to the Black Butte Center for Railroad Culture in Weed, California.
Between performances, Philo founders Michael Couture and Bill Schubart came into the old studio to talk to Palieri. “Do you hear it?” one of them said, Palieri said. “It’s the sound of the studio. It’s still in the walls.” 
The interaction lit the spark.
All the songs are originals except for one: “Going Down the Road Feeling Bad,” a traditional American folk song. A big part of folk music tradition is “playing the old stuff,” Palieri said. 
He recorded the song on an 1800s Edison phonograph cylinder — the earliest medium for recording sound for playback.
The project was not his first time finding inspiration from Phillips. He was featured on the 2009 album “Singing Through the Hard Times: A Tribute to Utah Phillips,” which earned a nomination for best traditional folk album at the Grammys that year. The nomination and his experience qualified him to join the Recording Academy, the group that judges music for the awards every year.
A lot of Palieri’s songs would seem perfect on the protest line, Like the folk singers of the past, Palieri’s pro-labor music works in response to a volatile political climate.
“We’re out on the street because we know how important it is to have our freedoms — to say what you wanna say and be who you wanna be,” Palieri said. “It’s more important than ever to be able to express who you are through your music and your work.”
He also has two books that capture his life and travels. “The Road Is My Mistress” is the first, from 2004. In his more recent — 2020’s “Banjo Man: Adventures of an American Folk Singer” — he hoped to say thank you to his mentors and pass along their stories.
“The stories are your biggest legacy. When you’re gone, the stories live on,” Palieri said.

If all goes as planned, a pregnant person working with a state-certified doula could have their expenses covered by Medicaid.

When Maria Rossi first started working as a doula 15 years ago, she immediately noticed a startling contrast in who was able to access her services. “It was so stark, the differences of what’s being offered to people who had means versus those who didn’t,” she said. 
That’s important because the benefit of doulas lies in their ability to work outside of the traditional medical establishment, she said. Rossi said doulas address the emotional needs of clients, rather than offering clinical medical services. 
Rossi started the doula program at Washington County Mental Health Services 12 years ago because she wanted to provide more birthing resources to Vermonters who aren’t white, are experiencing poverty, live in a rural area or struggle with substance abuse. 
For years, doulas across the state have told lawmakers their services can bridge the gap in resources. They’ve pointed to research that shows pregnant people who use doulas are more likely to have positive birthing outcomes. 
And they’ve asked lawmakers to make their services more affordable. 
Now, a new law signed by Gov. Phil Scott Monday, creates a roadmap to having Vermont Medicaid cover up to $2,100 in doula services. The state and federally funded insurance program would specifically pay for doulas to work with people before, during and after birth. The law also creates a certification program for community-based doulas who serve lower income and under-resourced populations.

The time around birth can be very powerful, but has the potential to be traumatic, Rossi said. 
From 2012 to 2023, 29 people died from pregnancy complications in Vermont, according to an annual state report. Across those cases, researchers found that rural counties in Vermont have a maternal mortality rate three times higher than in Chittenden County — and 83% of Vermonters who died during the perinatal period were insured by Medicaid. 
Nationwide more than 80% of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States are preventable, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. National data also shows huge racial disparities. Black people are more than three times likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause, according to the CDC. 
Those statistics, along with input from doulas, inspired the law.

If all goes as planned, a pregnant person working with a state-certified doula could have their expenses covered by Medicaid. But officials at the Department of Vermont Health Access, which operates the program, have “significant concerns regarding funding and implementation” of the law, said Alex McCracken, a spokesperson for the department. 
First, state officials must figure out how to certify doulas. The Office of Professional Regulation, which operates under the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office, is tasked with developing the certification process and carrying it out. The office wants a training standard that will teach doulas how to address the distinct needs of underserved populations, said Jennifer Colin, the office’s general counsel. 
Once the certification is designed, the Department of Vermont Health Access must seek federal approval to change its Medicaid plan by July 1, 2026. But health officials worry the “community-based” doula certification program as envisioned by the law won’t meet federal standards, McCracken said. 
In early May, McCracken cautioned lawmakers against any amendments to the state plan “given the current volatility and uncertainty in the federal environment.” Just days later, President Donald Trump announced billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid’s federal funding. 
Upon signing the bill, Scott gave those concerns a platform.
“Outstanding operational concerns must be addressed before we seek to amend our Medicaid plan,” Scott said in a statement. He urged lawmakers to address any unresolved administrative stumbling blocks next year. 
Lawmakers who worked on the legislation understand those concerns. Sen. Martine Laroque Gulick, D-Chittenden-Central, the bill’s lead sponsor, said she’s optimistic state agencies can work together to get everything ready for federal approval. 
Officials at the Office of Professional Regulation supported the bill and are excited about its passage, Colin said. She said state officials across agencies can work together to create a certification the feds will green-light.
Creating a certification process aims to strike a balance between public protection and maintaining accessibility, Colin said. 
To Rossi, accessibility is what the profession is all about. 
Doulas that could be certified under the new law are “usually serving a higher level of need, and a more marginalized population,” she said. Rossi describes her work as more of a “behavioral intervention” that addresses a client’s emotional needs. 
Rossi sees the law as an important step in closing gaps in access birthing resources and improving maternal care. She said the issue is timely as some hospitals in Vermont consider closing birthing centers in response to expensive healthcare costs. 
Lawmakers recently passed another new law aimed at expanding options for pregnant people. The legislation creates a licensure process for freestanding birthing centers and reduces regulatory barriers for them to open. The law also directs state administrators to seek Medicaid coverage for their services, and requires private insurers that cover maternity services to include freestanding birth centers as providers. 
Doulas are essential in rural communities where there are fewer health care resources, Rossi said, and research shows their services prevent birthing complications and make cesarean sections less likely — ultimately lowering hospital costs. 
Other doulas echoed the sentiment in conversations with officials from the Office of Professional Regulation, according to a state study prompted by a related law last year. 
Those conversations are why administrators recommended that lawmakers create a voluntary certification process for doulas, rather than setting a higher bar like a licensure requirement. One certified nurse midwife, who was not named in the study, said they work with immigrants and refugees in Chittenden County. 
They said the needs of immigrants are not being met — and that access to culturally relevant doula services could create better birthing outcomes and overall more positive medical experiences.
Now, private insurance companies might consider covering doulas as well. BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont started a pilot program last year to gauge member interest in doulas and has seen positive results, said spokesperson Sara Teachout. 
While the pilot is still ongoing, the company could mirror the state and provide coverage for certified doulas down the line, Teachout said.

The pursuit of truth has become overshadowed by narratives shaped by ideology rather than data. Political entanglement in the scientific realm hasn’t just obscured facts, it’s bred mistrust and disinformation—the antithesis of scientific discovery.
While both scientists and politicians influence public understanding, they do so differently. Scientists seek truth but often struggle to communicate in accessible terms. Conversely, politicians are effective communicators but aren’t always tethered to evidence. The resulting disconnect can fuel misunderstanding and deepen divides. An example: the debate around NIH budget cuts—not a clash of values, but perhaps a failure to understand one another.
Let’s talk numbers…
President Trump campaigned on the promise to curb national spending by eliminating what he deemed as “waste” to facilitate a smaller, more efficient government. In the era of inflation, I’m always looking for ways to save; a sentiment I’m sure many working Americans share. So, let’s break down the fiscal year of 2026 (FY2026) budget cuts.
In 2024, the federal government spent $6.75T, of which the National Institutes of Health accounted for a total of 0.7% of the total. In the FY2026 budget, the Trump administration cut the NIH budget by about 40%, which if effectuated, would save taxpayers nearly $18B. While this figure sounds impressive at first blush, compared to our total national FY2026 budget, it only represents a cut of around 1.5%. Meanwhile, the same proposal includes a 13% increase in defense spending, despite the existing U.S. military budget already exceeding that of the next ten countries combined.
The cost of defunding science
The federal government’s assault on science has begun to take a dramatic toll nationally. But let’s look at what this means for North Carolina; where science isn’t just an abstract benefit, but an economic engine. Prior to NIH cuts, the North Carolina life sciences industry generated $2.4 billion in state and local tax revenue annually. However, due to funding cuts, North Carolina lost over $1.2 billion in scientific funding and over 5,000 jobs. Some researchers estimate the state will lose nearly $659 million in new economic activity annually as a result.
Several prominent Ivy League, public, and private universities either admitted less students, rescinded offers, or paused admissions all together for the incoming 2025 class. Anecdotally, I’ve heard PhD students left to choose between joining labs they’re not interested in or dropping out of their programs altogether as labs are losing funding. We’re not just losing research dollars. We’re losing future scientists and, in turn, potential scientific breakthroughs as the next generation of scientists is being stymied.
The real disconnect: It’s not “wasteful” nor about “wokeness”
The FY2026 NIH cuts eliminate funding for what is termed “radical gender ideology” and “DEI expenditures.” Meanwhile, indirect costs—like keeping lab lights on, maintaining research infrastructure, and paying support staff—would be slashed from the traditional 30-60% down to 15%. The Trump administration argues the majority of taxpayer dollars designated for scientific research should go toward the direct advancement of science.
Here’s where the miscommunication lies:
As a taxpayer, I agree, the dollar amount I pay in taxes to fund science should go toward the direct advancement of science, not pushing any particular political ideology. As a scientist, however, I know that indirect costs are essential to scientific innovation. It’s impossible, for example, to run a freezer storing life-saving samples without electricity.
Moreover, collecting a diverse sample pool isn’t about advancing “woke ideology,” it’s good scientific practice. In fact, my job would be a lot easier if the human population was identical. However, biological differences, geographic factors, societal influences, even individual behaviors all have the potential to influence how diseases develop and treatment outcomes. If a medication isn’t tested across diverse groups, how can we trust it will work for everyone?
We’re actually on the same side
In spite of political differences, I believe most Americans—left, right, scientist, skeptic—want similar things: a strong economy, a healthy population, and the prudent use of taxpayer dollars. But we will not get there if we continue to talk past each other. We need to stop letting pride, fear, and bad communication hold scientific progress hostage. So, here’s my FY2026 proposal: let’s move forward by recognizing what is fact vs. ideology and come together—not as opponents but as citizens committed to solving problems. Science isn’t wasteful, it’s crucial. And the cost of cutting it too deeply may not show up on your next tax bill but perhaps your medical bill.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Research-flu-Getty-2025.jpeg,,,2025-06-15 07:00:12.928179

Jeff Landry addresses the Louisiana Legislature on opening day of legislative session, Monday, April 14, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)Louisiana lawmakers adjourned the 2025 regular lawmaking session Thursday having passed a budget with hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure spending; bills aimed at lowering insurance races; and a massive rewrite of state ethics laws. 
In its early days, the eight-week session was at first dominated by a battle between insurance companies and the personal injury attorneys over how to lower car insurance rates. 
That policy dispute also led to a showdown between Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple and Gov. Jeff Landry, both Republicans, over who should be held responsible for Louisiana’s sky-high insurance costs. 

At the end of the session, the governor engaged in a power struggle with Senate President Cameron Henry over private school vouchers and prescription drug regulations. 
The following list evaluates how certain political figures and causes fared in the lawmaking session:  

WINNER: Senate President Cameron Henry 

Henry, a Metairie Republican, resisted pressure from Landry and the conservative House to push through more radical policy proposals than he said the Senate, which has a more moderate approach to politics, felt uncomfortable adopting. 

Despite a wave of attack ads in the media and pressure from the governor, Henry refused to fund an expansion of Louisiana’s private education voucher program. He also declined to force a Senate vote on a proposal to radically remake Louisiana’s pharmacy network, in spite of social media threats from Landry to force a vote on the issue.  

The Senate president blocked a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion policies that the House endorsed. His chamber also turned down a proposal from Landry to give the governor more control over licensing boards and commissions. 
TOSS-UP: Gov. Jeff Landry 
As noted above, Landry lost a couple of high-profile legislative fights with the Senate over his signature private education voucher initiative and prescription drug regulations. 

Some of his strong-arm tactics also simply weren’t effective at getting his agenda passed, particularly in the Senate. 

Landry’s public rally with school children that was meant to pressure legislators into funding more vouchers didn’t elicit the response he wanted. The ultimatum he issued to call lawmakers back into a special session also didn’t force the Senate into passing the pharmacy bill he was backing. 
On other fronts however, he had legislative victories. He was largely able to get his agenda to address Louisiana’s car insurance crisis through the Legislature. A number of bills that reworked the way state agencies – including the Louisiana Workforce Commission, Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Children and Family Services – function also passed.

LOSER: Government transparency 
Lawmakers approve a handful of bills that will make it difficult to scrutinize government officials for inappropriate behavior, government corruption and conflicts of interest. 
House Bill 681 by Rep. Marcus Bryant, D-New Iberia, could subject people to jail time and fines if they post personal information about state lawmakers, statewide elected officials and Public Service Commissioners on the internet. 
It prevents the elected officials’ home addresses, phone numbers, personal email addresses, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, federal tax identification numbers, bank account numbers, credit and debit card numbers, license plate numbers from being published in government records or on a public website. Also protected under the law are marital records and birthdates. 
An official’s church, the school or daycare their child attends and the employment location of their spouse, children or dependents would also be shielded. 
Two other pieces of legislation that massively write government ethics and campaign finance laws would also lead to less disclosure of who is donating to and spending money on political campaigns. 
WINNER: Government corruption
Along with weakening public transparency laws, Landry and lawmakers have made it harder for the Louisiana Board of Ethics to charge any elected official, public employee or government contractor with wrongdoing. 
The change to the board’s investigative process may simply allow those accused of wrongdoing to run out the clock on the board’s ability to even bring charges against them, according to the board’s own members. 
The board is only given a year to investigate and charge a person with a violation before it reaches a legal deadline to do so. The new process for investigations is more time consuming and will make it difficult to finish on time, board members said.

LOSER: Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple
Temple successfully pushed most of his legislative agenda through, but he lost a public feud to fellow Republican Landry over a bill that would allow the governor to cast blame onto him for the state’s insurance crisis. He will now have greater authority to reject insurance rate hikes, a responsibility he doesn’t want to have. He will now be open to criticism when he doesn’t turn down rate increases that are not popular with the public. 
WINNER: Insurance industry
Insurance companies are the real winners of Temple’s agenda of “tort reform” bills they have been trying to get on the books for years. The new laws are supposed to tamp down lawsuits and reduce the amount of money plaintiffs can recover from bodily injury accidents.

LOSERS: Carbon capture critics 
Carbon capture and sequestration made a cozy home for itself in Louisiana this session. Bills attempting to assert local control over where and whether projects to store injected carbon dioxide underground happen largely died in committees. 
Other moves to ban the practice entirely or tax CO2 injection also got little love. Surviving CCS measures that made it into law are provisions restricting the use of eminent domain for CO2 storage transport pipelines and keeping court venues for these eminent domain claims local to the parish in question. 
WINNER: Rep. Dustin Miller
Miller, an Opelousas Democrat, holds a key seat as chairman of the House Committee on Health and Welfare in a legislature where Republicans hold the supermajority. One of his bills was amended in the late stages of the session to prohibit companies from owning both drugstores and pharmacy benefit managers in Louisiana. Although the legislation was denied a final vote in the Senate on the last day of the session, Miller still received a bipartisan standing ovation from his colleagues in the House for his effort.
He did manage to finesse an exclusion for his home city in one of the year’s most contested bills. A statewide ban on speeding enforcement cameras everywhere but school zones will take effect Aug. 1, except in Opelousas.       
WINNERS: Public school teachers 

Landry and lawmakers had initially said they would not give public school teachers another $2,000 pay stipend after a constitutional amendment to provide that money permanently failed to pass in March. They quickly backtracked, however, and ended up putting the teacher’s stipend back into the budget for the 2025-2026 school year. 

The lawmakers are also putting another constitutional amendment on the ballot next year that would raise teacher pay slightly if the voters approve it. Teachers and school support staff would get $2,250 and $1,125 more respectively in their permanent pay if the ballot proposition passes. 
The teachers also successfully fought off legislation that would have made it harder for their unions to collect dues that are automatically deducted from paychecks. 
LOSERS: Abortion medication providers 
Doctors and activists who provide abortion-inducing medications to Louisianians could be sued under a proposal approved by lawmakers. 
House Bill 575 by Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, easily passed both chambers. She dubbed her proposal the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act,” though it would apply to all forms of the procedure. 
In addition to allowing out-of-state providers to be sued, it extends the window for filing litigation from three years to five. 
TOSS-UP: College athletes 
Louisiana college athletes will not be receiving a tax exemption on their name, image and likeness (NIL) income this year, as two proposals to do so stalled due to the state’s lean budget situation. But lawmakers may take another crack at it after a task force meets over the next year and submits recommendations for NIL legislation. 
But each Division I college athletics program in Louisiana will be the beneficiary of an increased gambling tax, which will send nearly $2 million annually to be spent on expenses benefitting athletes. 
WINNERS: Nursing home owners  

Nursing home owners were able to pass legislation that will limit the damages collected from wrongful death and injury lawsuits brought against their facilities. There are 60-plus pending lawsuits from former clients and their families against nursing home ownership groups across the state currently. 
LOSERS: Civil service workers 
Lawmakers approved a constitutional amendment that could weaken the state civil service system that provides protections to thousands of state employees. The proposal still needs approval from Louisiana voters before it’s enacted, but the fact that the bill made it out of the legislature this year signals that a two-thirds majority of lawmakers may no longer value a system that has held strong in Louisiana for roughly 70 years.  
  Democratic lawmakers stand together May 19, 2025, in the Louisiana House of Representatives to oppose Rep. Emily Chenevert’s House Bill 685, which prohibits policy on diversity, equity and inclusion in state government and prevents state colleges and universities from requiring DEI in their curricula with limited exceptions. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)
WINNERS: DEI and academic freedom
A proposal that would have prohibited diversity, equity and inclusion practices across state government and prohibit state universities and colleges from requiring certain race and gender-based curricula for undergraduate students was purposefully stalled in the Senate. 
Henry, the senate president, said the measure was unnecessary. 
The bill was also opposed by The Louisiana chapter of the American Association of University Professors. 
LOSERS: People incarcerated on split-jury verdicts
Louisiana voters amended the state constitution in 2018 to eliminate convictions through non-unanimous juries in felony criminal trials, but the change didn’t apply to such verdicts before the change. Two years later, U.S. Supreme Court ruled that split-jury verdicts were unconstitutional, but it left it up to Louisiana to determine whether their ruling would apply to older cases.
Lawmakers have tried multiple times since then to provide an avenue for those convicted by non-unanimous juries to seek a review of their cases. Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, managed to get his bill through committee this year, but it was shot down on the Senate floor despite having the support of the Louisiana Republican Party and GOP Congressman Clay Higgins, an ardent anti-crime proponent.
WINNER: Children’s teeth 
Louisiana lawmakers opted against a conspiracy-theory fueled bill that would have prohibited public water systems from fluoridating their water. Water fluoridation is considered key in reducing dental complications in children. 
LOSER: Wetlands
It is now easier to build in Louisiana’s isolated wetland areas— kind of. The state adopted a new definition of what counts as a wetland with Senate Bill 94 by Senator Mike “Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, excluding areas cut off from surface water connection to rivers and lakes or surrounded by levees. 
Despite some legal confusion as to whether the legislation violates the Clean Water Act, there are now legal avenues to argue that these isolated wetland areas don’t need permits to drain, dredge and fill.
WINNER: Fortified roof program
Lawmakers have embraced the state’s fortified roof program as one of the only effective means of lowering homeowner insurance rates. This session, they established a new $10,000 income tax credit that should go a significant way in helping homeowners afford the hurricane-resistant roofs. 
WINNER: Saudi Arabia 
Louisiana has included $7 million in the state budget to spend on a LIV Golf League event that is expected to come to the Bayou Oaks golf course in New Orleans City Park next summer. 

Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world with nearly $1 trillion in assets, owns LIV Golf. 

LOSER: Science
The governor has signed a bill that bans the dispersion of chemicals for weather modification. Technological advances in  have safely produced results in rain-starved areas, but they have also launched far more unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. Louisiana joins Florida and Tennessee with new laws based on this speculation, and similar legislation is under consideration in other states. 
Awaiting the governor’s signature is a bill that would allow the over-the-counter sale of ivermectin. The drug’s proponents praise it as a treatment for COVID-19 symptoms, though federal regulators haven’t approved it for that use.

Regina Young (D-Philadelphia/Delaware) at a press conference in Harrisburg to raise awareness of wrongful conviction compensation legislation. (Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Most states have a system for compensating people after they’ve been exonerated. 
Pennsylvania does not, despite state lawmakers steadily introducing bills to create one for at least the past two decades.  
That would change under identical wrongful conviction compensation bills currently in each chamber of the state legislature. But the proposals are a mixed bag, according to some proponents, who believe few would qualify for payment.

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/13epWCCR.mp3
For now, exonerees in the commonwealth have to hire a lawyer and sue to try to get monetary damages for being imprisoned for something they didn’t do. 
Even then, winning these cases isn’t straightforward, according to attorney Jeffrey Deskovic. 
“The overwhelming majority of exonerees here in Pennsylvania are uncompensated because the facts of their case didn’t lend [themselves] to being able to prove malicious misconduct,” said Deskovic, who specializes in these cases after doing 15 years himself for a crime he did not commit. “It’s simply that they were wrongfully imprisoned.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Also, lawsuits often take years and the outcome’s uncertain, noted Bijan Taheri, executive director of Youth For Innocence, a consortium of high school and undergraduate volunteers who do case intake for lawyers. 
“ That’s time people who are just getting out of prison, who have no resources, don’t have,” Taheri says. “It’s really important that … these people can be compensated and have those services right out of the gate instead of being forced to wait three, four, five years and eventually, maybe, get compensated.”
Taheri, of Philadelphia, and Deskovic, of New York, spoke at a gathering on the Capitol steps to try to raise awareness of the legislation. New York-based national innocence nonprofit It Could Happen To You organized the event.
Thirty-eight states and Washington, D.C., have wrongful conviction compensation statutes.
Pennsylvania is the most populous of the remaining states without one, according to Professor Jeffrey Gutman, director of the Public Justice Advocacy Clinic at The George Washington University Law School.
The fine print
Most states don’t have a dedicated revenue stream or funding source for wrongful conviction compensation. The proposal in Pennsylvania also does not identify one. 
But the way the legislation reads currently would limit who qualifies, some advocates say. 
“It’s not gonna end up costing the state a dime because no one’s gonna get any money out of it,” said Adele Bernhard, a professor at New York Law School who’s focused her career on wrongful incarceration. 
To qualify, someone’s conviction would have to have been reversed based on “actual innocence,” the legislation states.
During the proposed compensation application process, the court would need to be “satisfied of the individual’s actual innocence,” to ultimately approve payment.
That phrase – actual innocence – stood out to both Bernhard, who first compiled a compensation statute policy matrix in 1999, and Gutman, who now keeps it updated for the National Registry of Exonerations. 
“ That’s bad language. Nobody will get their award,” Bernhard said. “It’ll be a stumbling block.” 
That’s because judges tend to overturn convictions when there’s new evidence – a witness, new information about the confession or identification, etc. – that they believe, had a jury heard it, would’ve resulted in an acquittal instead, she said. 
“DNA is obviously a slam dunk. And it depends what else you have,” Bernhard said. “Whatever it is, is that new information sufficient for a court to say you’re actually innocent? They are not generally going to say that. They’re going to hedge their bets a bit and say, ‘No. I think a jury would’ve acquitted if they’d heard this information about the police officer.’”
Five states require a prior finding of actual innocence to qualify for wrongful conviction compensation. 
Pennsylvania’s law could say something like “the conviction was overturned and the indictment vacated on grounds consistent with innocence,” she said. 
“That gets rid of the bogus claims where somebody’s had their case overturned based on some sort of a technicality and then dismissed because they can’t find the witness and it has absolutely nothing to do with innocence,” she said. 
The  measure calls for a process that’s as informal as possible. But people likely will need an attorney to navigate it, according Bernhard, especially because prosecutors on the original case would have a month to object. 
Petitioners would have 15 days to respond to any objections from law enforcement or a flat out denial, according to the legislation. 
Those relatively tight timelines could help address delays that can be an issue in some other states, Bernhard said. 
Some components match what’s in place in other states, according to Gutman.
The bill also calls for: 

Paying exonerees between $75,000 per year of wrongful incarceration – or $100,000 if the person was on death row – plus $50,000 per year on probation or parole.
Reimbursements for related expenses such as restitution and medical care, in addition to no more than $75,000 in legal fees (calculated at up to 10 percent of the payout)
A six-year window to file for payment starting upon release from prison or a decision on a compensation application, whichever is later.
Notifying potentially eligible people by the Department of Human Services and Board of Pardons. 

“The provisions about non-monetary services are quite strong, but they don’t help people who don’t qualify,” Gutman said via email. 
Sponsor Sen. Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia/Montgomery) said lawmakers have been working to find language that gets enough support to move the bill. 
“We’re going to continue to try to be creative,” Hughes said. “We’re gonna try to answer people’s concerns or questions. The objective remains the same. But maybe we have to utilize different language to get it all the way home.”
A spokesperson for cosponsor Sen. Camera Bartolotta (R-Washington) said her office didn’t participate in negotiations about the language in the bill. 
 The impact of stigma 
Some advocates said they believe an application-based system would mean more predictable costs – potentially lower, even.
Adequate support would ultimately help exonerees get back on their feet and contribute to society, they noted.
Deskovic said he experienced the difference first-hand. The New Yorker said his home state didn’t have wrongful conviction compensation when he was exonerated and released, let alone re-entry services. 
“I was always passed over for gainful employment,” he said. “There was a stigma around whether I was out on a technicality or because I was innocent.”
Deskovic struggled, as many exonerees do, with catching up to new technology during his prison sentence, in addition to post-traumatic stress and finding stable housing. 
Five years later, he secured compensation through New York’s compensation statute. 
“Suddenly, I didn’t have the mental strain,” Deskovic says. “I was able to pay my bills. I was able to go to college, get a bachelor’s and master’s and a law degree, and be a lawyer, and have a nonprofit organization. I know many exonerees in other states that have compensation that were able to put their lives back together again.”
Yeidja Bostick, of Philadelphia, is still waiting for that reprieve.
“It’s really come to a point that this compensation is like a matter of life and death,” Bostick said. “All those years I felt like I could have been financially okay if I had gainful employment. But really no one wants to hire you.”
Bostick’s conviction for vehicular homicide was overturned at the end of 1993. 
She said she didn’t receive support for finding a job, managing post-traumatic stress or anything else after her exoneration and release from prison. She said she’s now working as a courier driver and getting by, but still struggling with debt accumulated over years of struggling to find stability and gainful employment. 
“There’s nothing that we can do to get that time back, but going forward, it’s time to right the wrongs of the injustice,” Bostick said. “Just make it happen.”
It’s not just prison itself, supporters pointed out: the trauma of the experience, the toll it takes on physical health and the ensuing loss of time, educational opportunities, career progression and financial stability have devastating longterm consequences. 
Stigma and lack of specific support exacerbate all of that, as Deskovic referenced. 
Researchers have documented discrimination against exonerees in multiple arenas including housing and employment. 
A recent study added to the canon with an audit of therapists. 
Basically, the team emailed therapists with nearly identical treatment queries. They described symptoms verbatim. The change came with just a few words: the writer identified as either a former first responder, someone on parole or someone who’d been exonerated.
Exonerees had the lowest response rates, with nearly half of emails ignored. 
One possible explanation, according to Towson University Professor Jeff Kukucka, is that people simply don’t believe the claims of innocence (despite these being upheld in court). 
Parolees got the most referrals, with about 40 percent of respondents suggesting another provider. 
To Kukucka, a lead researcher on the study, that supports a better explanation: a systemic blind spot when it comes to exonerees. So, the therapists didn’t know how to help or what to suggest as an alternative. 
“There are tons of agencies whose mission is to help people transition from life in prison and criminal offenses to a productive crime-free life after prison, that are geared toward giving people a second chance,” Kukucka said. “We don’t yet have nearly the same level of systemic support for wrongly incarcerated people.” 
Fifteen of the 39 states with compensation statutes guarantee mental health support for people with an overturned conviction. 
“ There’s an assumption that’s implicit in a lot of these statutes that when a wrongly incarcerated person leaves prison and comes back into society, that if we give them some money, they’ll be able to figure it out,” he said.
Political progress? 
Two years ago in Pennsylvania, a wrongful conviction compensation bill passed out the House Judiciary Committee on a party line vote before stalling for the year or so remaining in that session. That’s the most progress any legislation on the issue’s made. 
State Rep. Regina Young (D-Philadelphia/Delaware), the House measure’s sponsor now and then, says she’s optimistic. 
 ”The last time I spoke with the judiciary leader on the House Republican side, they were considering it,” Young said Tuesday.
That would be State Rep. Rob Kauffman (R-Chambersburg). 
As the GOP minority House Judiciary chairman, Kauffman expressed concerns last session during the committee’s discussion that included extending eligibility to people who’d been pardoned and pleaded no contest. 
The current version of the bill states that people can qualify with a pardon or if they pleaded no contest during their original case. 
Kauffman didn’t respond to interview requests for this story. Nor did the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association. 
Those who’d be ineligible include someone incarcerated for a different conviction that wasn’t overturned. 
“It’s hard to imagine a greater injustice than losing decades behind bars for a crime you did not commit,” Young said during her remarks last week in Harrisburg. “You receive no compensation for your time and minimal assistance with the transition back to society without a clear understanding of the world you’re walking back into.”
Young’s office did not respond to requests for comment after the event about the bill language. Organizers hope to meet with her “to tighten up the bill”, said Bill Bastuk, who heads advocacy organization It Could Happen to You.

This story about international students was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education. Sign up for the Hechinger newsletter.
A Black History Month event, canceled. A lab working to fight hunger, shuttered. Student visas revoked, then reinstated, uncertain for how long. Opportunities for students pursuing science careers, fading.
The first six months of the Trump administration have brought a hailstorm of changes to the nation’s colleges and universities. While the president’s faceoffs with Harvard and Columbia have generated the most attention, students on campuses throughout the country are noticing the effects of the administration’s cuts to scientific and medical research, clampdown on any efforts promoting diversity equity and inclusion (DEI), newly aggressive policies for students with loan debt, revoking of visas for international students and more. 
Many of the administration’s actions are being challenged in court, but they are influencing the way students interact with each other, what support they can get from their institutions — and even whether they feel safe in this nation.   
The Hechinger Report traveled to campuses around the country to look at what these changes mean for students. Reporters visited universities in four states — California, Illinois, Louisiana and Texas — to understand this new era for higher education.
LSU:’DEI is being wiped away’
 Last fall, Louisiana State University student A’shawna Smith had an idea for a new campus group to educate students about their legal rights and broader problems in the criminal justice system. Smith, a sociology major, had spent the prior summer interning at a law firm and noticed how many clients didn’t know their rights after an arrest. 
Smith, now a rising senior, called it The Injustice Reform and soon recruited classmates and a campus adviser. They wrote a mission statement and trained as student group leaders. On Feb. 20, LSU’s student government, which awards money to campus groups that comes from student fees, gave them $1,200; Smith and her classmates planned to use the award to recruit members and organize events. 
But on April 8, Injustice Reform’s treasurer received a text message from Cortney Greavis, LSU’s student government adviser. She said LSU was rescinding the money: The group’s mission statement ran afoul of new federal and state restrictions on DEI. Its mission mentions racial disparities and police brutality, but the organizers were never told which words violated the rules. Smith and fellow leaders started chipping in their own money to keep the group going: $10 here and there, whatever they could afford, said Bella Porché, a rising senior on the group’s executive board. 
Canceling awards to student groups is one way students say administrators at LSU, the state’s flagship university, have restricted what they can do and say since the U.S. Department of Education wrote to schools and colleges nationwide on Valentine’s Day. The letter described DEI efforts — designed to rectify current and historic discrimination — as discriminatory and threatened schools with the loss of federal money unless they ended the consideration of race in admissions, financial aid, housing, training and other practices. 
Since the letter, discussion of DEI on campus “has become an anti-gay, anti-Black sort of conversation,” said Emma Miller, a rising senior and elected student senator. “People who are minorities don’t feel safe anymore, don’t feel represented, don’t feel seen, because DEI is being wiped away and their university is not saying anything.” 
In a March 7 report, the university detailed dozens of changes made to comply with the letter’s demands. For example, it ended any preference granted to students from historically underrepresented groups for certain privately funded scholarships; opened membership in school-funded student organizations — like a women-in-business group — to all; and canceled activities perceived to emphasize race, even a fitness class kicking off Black History Month.  
Student government leaders say the restrictions hinder their ability to operate. Rising junior Tyhlar Holliway, a member of the student government’s Black Caucus, said school administrators essentially shut down the caucus’ proposal that the student government issue a statement after the Department of Education letter in support of DEI programs and initiatives. 
LSU public relations staff did not respond to interview requests or to an emailed list of questions, and the school’s civil rights and Title IX division director declined to speak.
Miller said administrators have told student leaders that all their proposed legislation must be reviewed by the school’s general counsel for compliance with the March 7 guidelines. The administration, for example, blocked a student government bill to fund a Black hair care event designed to help students prepare for career and professional opportunities, said senior Paris Holman, a student government member. “We have conferences and interviews and need to know how to take care of our hair,” said Holman, who is Black. 
Students have also tailored the language of other bills to avoid the appearance of support for DEI. Holman said that in one case the student senate changed the language in a bill funding an end-of-year event for a minority student organization to remove any reference to the organization as serving minority students. 
The school also overrode student government decisions about which groups, like A’shawna Smith’s, could be funded by student fees. In February, the student government voted to provide $641 to help a pre-med student, who is Black, attend a student medical education conference, in part so she could share what she’d learn with other pre-med students. A few weeks later, she received an email from Greavis, the student government adviser, saying she wouldn’t be able to attend with university funds because that money could no longer be used for “DEI-related events, initiatives, programs, or travel.” Greavis didn’t respond to requests for an interview.
The email didn’t specify why the medical conference crossed the line. But the sponsoring organization’s mission statement notes its commitment to “supporting current and future underrepresented minority medical students,” and a conference plenary speaker was scheduled to address the “enduring case for DEI in medicine.” Fewer than 6 percent of doctors are Black and research has shown improved health outcomes for Black patients who are seen by physicians of the same race.    
“It doesn’t feel like a democracy,” said Holman of serving in student government at this moment. 
Tell the Hechinger Report how Trump policy is changing life on your campus.
She and other students say the university’s actions are starting to change the broader culture at LSU, which serves nearly 40,000 undergraduate and graduate students on its campus of Italian Renaissance buildings shaded by magnolias and Southern live oaks. About 60% of students are white and 18% are Black, according to federal data. 
Mila Fair, a rising sophomore journalism major and a reporter for the campus TV station, said students tell her they’re afraid to join protests, in part because of LSU’s new anti-DEI rules and the national crackdown on student demonstrations. Those who do attend are often afraid to go on camera with her, she said. 
  LSU Professor Andrew Sluyter (Steven Yoder/ The Hechinger Report
Latin American studies professor Andrew Sluyter said administrators normally listen to the student government — even more than to the faculty government — but now worry about students getting the school into “political hot water.” He had his own run-in with the DEI ban: As part of a February effort to scrub school websites of diversity references, in which the university purged hundreds of webpages referencing DEI-related content, LSU deleted a 2022 press release announcing a prestigious fellowship he’d won that mentioned “higher education’s racial inequities.” 
Students recognize the pressure LSU is under from the federal government, but they want administrators to stand up for them, said graduate student Alicia Cerquone, a student senator. “We want some sort of communication from the university that shows commitment to its community, that they have our backs and they’ll protect students,” she said.

‘Try to stay under the radar’
BERKELEY, Calif. — Since early April, Rayne Xue, a junior at the University of California, Berkeley, has watched with trepidation as the Trump administration has taken one step after another to limit international students’ access to American higher education. 
First came the abrupt cancellation, then reinstatement, of visas for 23 Berkeley students and recent graduates. Then the government cut off Harvard’s ability to enroll international students — a move since blocked by a federal judge — raising fears that something similar could happen at Berkeley. And late last month, as this year’s graduates were celebrating their recent commencements, Secretary of State Marco Rubio paused interviews for all new student visas and announced he would “aggressively revoke” those of Chinese students.
Xue, who is from Beijing and won a student senate seat this past spring on a platform of supporting international students, said the administration’s actions strike at a critical part of campus life at Berkeley.
“College is the opportunity of a lifetime to unlearn prejudices and embrace new perspectives, neither of which is possible without a student body that comes from a wide range of geographic and cultural backgrounds,” she said.
About 16% of UC Berkeley’s more than 45,000 students come from outside the United States to study at the crown jewel of California’s public research university system, where creeks run through campus beneath cooling redwoods and parking spaces are set aside for Nobel laureates. China, India, South Korea and Canada send the biggest numbers. International students pay higher tuition than California residents, boosting the university’s coffers and subsidizing some of their peers. Many of them conduct cutting-edge research in fields like computer science, engineering and chemistry.

Now the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, magnified by the yanking of billions in federal research dollars, has international students worried about their future on campus. Many are changing their behavior to avoid scrutiny: Some canceled travel plans and many said they avoid walking near any campus protests in fear of being photographed.
“It’s difficult for international students to feel secure when they cannot anticipate what the administration might charge against them next — or whether they might be unfairly targeted,” said one global studies major who asked not to be identified for fear of attracting retaliation.
Tomba Morreau, a rising junior from the Netherlands studying sociology, said he stopped posting about politics on social media — just in case.
 That kind of self-censorship troubles Paul Fine, co-chair of the Berkeley Faculty Association, which represents about a fifth of the university’s tenure-track faculty. 
Federal policies are “creating this culture of fear where people start to censor themselves and try to stay under the radar and not show up in their full selves, whether for academic work or activism,” he said.
Related: International students are rethinking coming to the U.S. That’s a problem for colleges
 International students in Fine’s classes told him they wanted to attend a recent protest against federal threats to higher education but were afraid of the consequences, he said. Others told him they were skipping academic conferences outside the United States that they otherwise would have attended.
 “Berkeley really prides ourselves on being an intellectual hub that convenes people from all over the world to work on the most important problems,” Fine said. Now that identity is at risk, he said, especially as actual and threatened cuts to grants make it harder for faculty to hire international graduate students and postdocs. 
Most poignant, he said, was hearing from demoralized Chinese students who left a repressive government to come to the United States only to see attacks on academic freedom replicated here. 
Xue said she hopes the crisis facing universities would draw attention to the challenges international students face, including limited financial aid and the stereotype that all of them are wealthy. With her colleagues in student government, she is lobbying for Berkeley to spend more on the international office, which provides one-on-one advising on visa issues and employment.

For Lily Liu, a Chinese computer scientist, 2025 was shaping up to be a year of milestones. She graduated with a doctorate last month, has a job lined up at a leading artificial intelligence company and is engaged to be married in November.
But the Trump administration’s changing policies toward international scholars have complicated celebrations for Liu, who’s in a federal program that extends her visa for up to a year beyond graduation so she can gain work experience here. She canceled summer travel plans with her family, concerned she might not be let back into the country. And she’s considering moving her wedding to the United States from China, even though many of her relatives wouldn’t be able to attend.
“For international students, every policy affects us a lot,” she said. So Liu is careful. After the publication of her thesis was delayed, she visited Berkeley’s international office to make sure the setback wouldn’t affect her work permit. Her fiancé has a green card, which should theoretically mean his immigration status is more stable. But these days, she said, who knows?

‘In a hundred days everything was destroyed’
SAN ANTONIO — Growing up here, Reina Saldivar had always loved science — all she wanted to watch on TV was “Animal Planet.” Yet until she applied on a whim to a program for aspiring researchers after her first year at the University of Texas at San Antonio, she assumed she would spend her life as a lab technician, running cultures. 
The program, Maximizing Access to Research Careers, or MARC, was started by the National Institutes of Health decades ago at colleges around the country to prepare students, especially those from historically underrepresented backgrounds, for livelihoods in the biomedical sciences. 
Saldivar got in. And through the program, she spent much of her time on campus in a university lab, helping develop a carrier molecule for a new Lyme disease vaccine. Now Saldivar, who graduated this spring, plans to eventually return to academia for a doctorate.  
“What MARC taught me was that my dreams aren’t out of reach,” she said.
Saldivar is among hundreds who’ve participated in the MARC program since its 1980 founding at the University of Texas at San Antonio. She may also be among the last. In April, the university’s MARC program director, Edwin Barea-Rodriguez, opened his email inbox to find a form letter terminating the initiative and advising against recruiting more cohorts. 
The letter cited “changes in NIH/HHS [Health and Human Services] priorities.” In recent months, the Trump administration has canceled at least half a dozen programs meant to train scholars and diversify the sciences as part of an effort to root out what the president labels illegal DEI. 
In a statement to The Hechinger Report, NIH said that it “is committed to restoring the agency to its tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science” and is reviewing grants to make sure the agency is “addressing the United States chronic disease epidemic.”

With MARC ending, Barea-Rodriguez is searching for a way to continue supporting current participants until they graduate next academic year. Without access to federal money, however, the young scientists are anxious about their futures — and that of public health in general. 
“It took years to be where we are now,” said Barea-Rodriguez, who said he was not speaking on behalf of his university, “and in a hundred days everything was destroyed.” 
UTSA’s sprawling campus sits on the northwest edge of San Antonio, far from tourist sites like the Alamo and the River Walk. Forty-four percent of the nearly 31,000 undergraduate students are the first in their families to attend college; more than 61 percent identify as Hispanic or Latino. The university was one of the first nationwide to earn Department of Education recognition as a Hispanic-serving institution, a designation for colleges where at least a quarter of full-time undergraduates are Hispanic.
When Barea-Rodriguez arrived to teach at the school in 1995, many locals considered it a glorified community college, he said. But in the three decades since, the investments NIH made through MARC and other federal programs have helped it become a top-tier research university. That provided students like Saldivar with access to world-class opportunities close to home and fostered talent that propelled the economy in San Antonio and beyond. 
The Trump administration has quickly upended much of that infrastructure, not only by terminating career pipeline programs for scholars, but also by pulling more than $8.2 million in National Science Foundation money from UTSA. 
One of those canceled grants paid for student researchers and the development of new technologies to improve equity in math education and better serve elementary school kids from underrepresented backgrounds in a city that is about 64% Hispanic. Another aimed to provide science, technology, engineering and math programming to bilingual and low-income communities. 
UTSA administrators did not respond to requests for comment about how federal funding freezes and cuts are affecting the university. Nationwide, more than 1,600 NSF grants have been axed since January.

In San Antonio, undergraduates said MARC and other now-dead programs helped prepare them for academic and professional careers that might have otherwise been elusive. Speaking in a lab remodeled and furnished with NIH money, where leftover notes and diagrams on glass erase boards showed the research questions students had been noodling, they described how the programs taught them about drafting an abstract, honing public speaking and writing skills, networking, putting together a résumé and applying for summer research positions, travel scholarships and graduate opportunities. 
“All of the achievements that I’ve collected have pretty much been, like, a direct result of the program,” said Seth Fremin, a senior biochemistry major who transferred to UTSA from community college and has co-authored five articles in major journals, with more in the pipeline. After graduation, he will start a fully funded doctoral program at the University of Pittsburgh to continue his research on better understanding chemical reactions. 
Similarly, Elizabeth Negron, a rising senior, is spending this summer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, researching skin microbiomes to see if certain bacteria predispose some people to cancers. 
“It’s weird when you meet students who didn’t get into these programs,” Negron said, referring to MARC. “They haven’t gone to conferences. They haven’t done research. They haven’t been able to mentor students. … It’s very strange to acknowledge what life would have been without it. I don’t know if I could say I’d be as successful as I am now.” 
With money for MARC erased, Negron said she will probably need a job once she returns to campus in the fall so she can afford day-to-day expenses. Before, research was her job. 
“Without MARC,” she said, “it becomes a question of can I at least cover my tuition and my very basic needs.”

‘We could potentially lose a generation of scientists’
CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — When Peter Goldsmith received notice in late January that his Soybean Innovation Lab at the University of Illinois would soon lose all of its funding, he had no idea it was coming. Suddenly Goldsmith, the lab’s director, had to tell his 30 employees they would soon be out of a job and tell research partners across Africa that operations would come to a halt. The lab didn’t even have money to water its soybean fields in Africa. 
One employee, Julia Paniago, was in Malawi when she got the news. “We came back the next day,” she said of her team, “and it was a lot of uncertainty. And a lot of people cried.”
The University of Illinois’ Soybean Innovation Lab (SIL) was part of a network of 17 labs at universities across the country, all working on research related to food production and reducing global hunger, and all funded through the U.S. Agency for International Development — until the Trump administration shut down USAID.
Soybeans — which provide both oil and high-protein food — aren’t yet commonly grown in Malawi. SIL researchers have been working toward two related goals: helping local farmers increase soybean production and ameliorate malnutrition and generating enough interest in the crop there that a new export market will open for American farmers.
The lab’s researchers work in soybean breeding, economics and mechanical research as well as education. They hope to show that soybean production in Africa is worth further investment so that eventually the private sector will come in after them.
“The people who work at SIL, they like being right at the frontier of change,” Goldsmith said. “It’s high-risk work — that’s what the universities do, that’s what scientific research is about.”

UI, the state’s flagship with a sprawling campus spread between the cities of Urbana and Champaign, is noted for its research work, especially agricultural research.
Labs and researchers across the university lost funding in cuts made by the Trump administration; more than $25 million from agencies including NIH, NSF and the National Endowment for the Humanities was cut, Melissa Edwards, associate vice chancellor for research and innovation, said, a total of 59 grants amounting to 3.6% of their overall federal grant portfolio.
Annette Donnelly, who just received her doctorate in education, is among those affected. Her research focuses on educating malnourished children in Africa and developing courses to help Africans learn how to process soybeans into oil.

In April, SIL was handed a lifeline — an anonymous $1 million gift that will keep the lab running through April 2026. The donation wasn’t enough for Goldsmith to rehire all of his employees; SIL’s annual operating budget before the USAID cuts was $3.3 million (and would have kept things running through 2027). But, he said, the money will allow SIL to continue its research in the Lower Shire Valley in Malawi, a project he hopes will attract future donors to fund the lab’s work. 
The April donation saved Donnelly’s job, but her priorities shifted.  “We’re doing research,” she said, “but we’re also doing a lot of proposal writing. It has taken on a much greater priority.” 
Donnelly hopes to attract more funding so she can resume research she had started in western Kenya, demonstrating that introducing soy into children’s diets increased their protein intake by up to 65%, she said.
The impact that funding cuts will have on researchers at the soybean lab pales in comparison to the impact on their partners in Africa, Donnelly emphasized. There, she said, the cuts mean processors will likely slow production, limiting their ability to deliver soy products. “The consequences there are much bigger,” she said.
The Soybean Innovation Lab was funded through the Feed the Future initiative, a program to help partner countries develop better agricultural practices that began under the Obama administration in 2010. All 17 Feed the Future innovation labs funded through USAID lost funding, except for the one at Kansas State University, which studies heat-tolerant wheat.
The soybean lab’s office is housed on a quiet edge of the Illinois campus in a building once occupied by the university’s veterinary medicine program. Across the street, rows of greenhouses are home to the Crop Science Department’s experiments.
There, Brian Diers is breeding soybean varieties that resist soybean rust, a disease that’s been an obstacle to ramping up soybean production across sub-Saharan Africa. A professor emeritus who is retired, Diers works part-time at SIL to assist with soybean breeding. The April donation wasn’t enough to cover his work. Now he volunteers his time.
“ If we can help African agriculture take off and become more productive, that’s eventually going to help their economies and then provide more opportunities for American farmers to export to Africa,” he said.
Goldsmith drew an analogy between his lab’s work and the state of American agriculture in the 1930s. As the Dust Bowl swept through the Great Plains, Monsanto or another company could have stepped in to help combat it, but didn’t. Public land-grant universities did. 
“That’s where the innovation comes from, from the public land grants in the U.S.,” Goldsmith said. “And now the public land grants still work in U.S. agriculture but also in the developing world.” 
Commercial soybean producers hesitate to dip their toes into unproven markets, he said, so it’s SIL’s job to demonstrate that a viable market exists. “That was our secret sauce, in that lots of commercial players liked the products, the technologies we had, and wanted to move into the soybean space, but it wasn’t a profitable market,” Goldsmith said of the African soybean market.
Diers said federal funding cuts imperil not just the development of commerce and global food production but the next generation of scientists as well. 
“We could potentially lose a generation of scientists who won’t go into science because there’s no funding right now,” he said.

Kennedy Jr. painted a bleak picture of people with autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, that was especially hurtful to some.","Editor’s note: We now offer an audio version of our Sunday features. To access, click on the player above.
Emma McKeever and her mom, Pamela, often do artistic projects together. 
Emma likes to make digital drawings inspired by her favorite songs, and Pamela helps her turn those illustrations into notecards. Sometimes they make floral arrangements that incorporate vegetables: Emma might put carrots in a vase alongside flowers or sculpt a cabbage into a vessel for irises and tulips.
But in May, when mother and daughter decided to turn their sights on another creative project — writing poetry — they weren’t inspired by nature or music. Rather, they were looking for an outlet for their frustration after a press conference by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about people with autism — people like Emma.
At that press conference, Kennedy discussed a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that found the rates of autism are rising, and he announced a significant new investment in research to find the cause of autism. But his remarks were peppered with assertions that experts say are untrue or misleading. He claimed that new research efforts would discover an environmental cause of autism in just a few months, even as scientists say that research overwhelmingly points to autism as primarily genetic.
Kennedy also painted a bleak picture of people with autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, that was especially hurtful to Emma.
“These are kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job, they’ll never play baseball, they’ll never write a poem, they’ll never go out on a date,” Kennedy said. “Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”
At the press conference, Kennedy seemed to be speaking about people with ASD who face the most significant challenges, along a broad spectrum. But he didn’t specify that in his remarks, and seemed to paint all people with ASD with a broad brush.
Emma wrote her poem as a kind of rebuke. In it, she wonders about the inner thoughts of the HHS Secretary:
Did RFK Jr ever think?
Did he really think that I, an autistic person, couldn’t write a poem? 
Did he ever stop to listen to himself, to the nonsense he was speaking?
That the false words, the wretched lies he spouts, are something to believe?
Are his words out of greed and selfishness or to better lives?
Did he really believe that it was okay to strip funding from families in need of financial support? Did he ever think that accessing databases violates our privacy about protected health information? 
Did RFK ever think we would just roll over and accept this treatment?! 
His thought that autism is a curse that destroys families IS the tragedy. 
It did not destroy my family, it made my family stronger, more real! 
I have a great mind, maybe sharper than his. 
So, did RFK Jr ever think?  
This is hardly the first time that Kennedy has cast autism as a national scourge with a culprit hiding in plain sight. In 2005, he penned an article then published in Rolling Stone and Salon, titled “Deadly Immunity,” which pointed to research arguing that a preservative in vaccines called thimerosal causes autism. 
In the years since, Kennedy has focused on the specter of climbing autism rates to drum up skepticism about vaccines writ large, even as scientists concluded that there is no link between autism and vaccines. Families impacted by autism who have followed this debate have found themselves riding an emotional rollercoaster: some felt hopeful when a study suggested a causal link between vaccines and autism and then lost trust in scientific research when they learned that the data in that oft-cited study was falsified. Despite overwhelming agreement in the scientific community that there is no link between autism and vaccines, Kennedy has remained a vaccine skeptic.

But Kennedy is no longer voicing his skepticism of mainstream science from the sidelines. As the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, he is now the most powerful figure in public health in the United States. In that role, his view on autism is already starting to have a tangible impact. 
Since Kennedy’s tenure began, the Trump administration has ended vital services for autism and made federal cuts to research funding related to autism. Kennedy also announced the creation of a database or registry, where information about people with autism would be collected to facilitate the search for causation. Parents of children with ASD, and adults with ASD are especially anxious about the registry, saying it would violate their privacy. They say his rhetoric is creating stigma around a community that has worked hard to find acceptance. 
Some parents of people with ASD who require significant caretaking say they’re hopeful that a new burst of energy from the federal government could bring promising advancements. But scientists and health care professionals are concerned that the investments Kennedy has in mind are wrongheaded, and that the loss of valuable programs and rising stigma could have a damaging impact with long-ranging consequences. 
If you’ve met one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism
Emma, who is 28, was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder when she was in seventh grade. Before that, her mom Pamela had gotten Emma help with hearing deficits and speech issues, obstacles with readily apparent remedies. When Emma was finally diagnosed with autism, Pamela was initially devastated; she knew it was a lifelong condition.

“But in the long run, I can’t imagine it any other way — she’s such a gift,” Pamela said. 
That’s part of why Kennedy’s speech stung: he was presenting autism as a scourge. And for Pamela, that couldn’t be further from the truth. 
“I think it’s so important to understand that in Emma’s world, her family, the people around her, we feel so lucky to have her in our lives,” Pamela said.
“I think that autistic people are just people,” Emma said. “I think they shouldn’t be treated like abominations.”
That’s not to say that the journey has been easy for the McKeevers. Emma has some symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and some facial and vocal tics, which she says can make certain situations “a bit awkward.” Pamela is most concerned about Emma’s awareness of what’s going on around her and how that impedes her ability to connect with others. 
“I think that that would be the No. 1 thing I would say that I’m worried about sometimes, is that she’s not in the moment.” 
But to say that Emma is representative of the ASD community is to misunderstand the nature of the spectrum. 
There’s a popular quote from Dr. Stephen Shore, a professor who studies autism: “If you’ve met one person with autism, you’ve met one person with autism.” It means the spectrum is wide, and the condition is highly individual. That’s partly because, unlike a condition with a clear genetic marker like Down Syndrome or trisomy 18, ASD encompasses a wide range of conditions that share some characteristics. 
“This category that we call autism is a category based on clinician description of behavior, not on biology,” said Dr. James McPartland, who directs both the Yale Developmental Disabilities Clinic and the Yale Center for Brain and Mind Health. Diagnosticians have historically determined whether a person has autism not by looking at results they can see through a microscope or on a scan, but by observing and testing their behavior — including communication style and sensory sensitivities, he said. 
McPartland is one of many scientists in the U.S. and around the world working to develop brain imaging techniques that might be able to more accurately differentiate between different types of autism in ways that could be useful for recommending therapies or even predicting a person’s long-term likelihood of accomplishing different milestones, like living independently.

For Beth Katten, whose son Gary recently turned 30, Kennedy’s speech didn’t offend. Gary has what Katten terms “profound autism,” or the end of the spectrum at which people require the most assistance with tasks. (ASD is also clinically classified by levels, ranging from Level 1, which requires the least support, to Level 3, which requires the most support.) Gary doesn’t have much social speech, so Katten said she can’t have a meaningful conversation with him. 
Gary can’t cook by himself or be left alone, and that meant Katten had to leave the workforce when he was young. Now, Gary has a caretaker for part of the day, but the question of what will happen when Katten and her husband are gone haunts her. 
Katten has done a lot of research over the years into the causes of autism, and when she heard Kennedy’s speech she was dismissive of some of his ideas, but she also welcomed the renewed burst of attention to the issue from such a high ranking government official. 
She also was hopeful about Kennedy’s effort to look for a cause for people with profound autism — something Kennedy announced would happen by the fall, an extraordinary timeline. “People in the profound community were saying, ‘He’s shedding light on it, and you know what, he’s talking about my kid. He’s not talking about the ones on ‘Love on the Spectrum,’” the popular Netflix reality series. “I can’t even watch that show because it’s too much the other way.” 
Helen Taylor, whose son Chase has ASD, was deeply concerned about Kennedy’s remarks, in part because she thought what she heard revealed a person ignorant of the community’s wants and needs. As the founder of a Waterbury-based nonprofit called The Social Chase, which helps young people on the spectrum find social opportunities, Taylor has a lot of experience with the breadth of the spectrum.  
“To make it seem like, ‘How horrible it is to have a child you were given’ — it was egregious,” she said. “Some parents who have an adult child, who are still diapering their child and have to wash them up, do they want a cure? Yes, they do. Some have a child who is high functioning, and do they want a cure for that child? No.”

For some families, getting to acceptance has been a hard won battle. Anita Cella had her son Nick in 2001 and she noticed that he was completing his milestones later than his older siblings. “​​I kind of had to figure it out on my own, because pediatricians didn’t give a screening or anything,” she said.
Nick started with interventions from a speech therapist before seeing a neurologist who told Cella he likely had autism. At first, Cella was angry, and the doctor told her she should seek a second opinion. 
“I followed up with another neurologist who, in no short order, told me Nick probably should, because of all his disabilities, be in an institution,” Cella recalled. “I mean, it was really a horrible time.” Finally, Cella found a developmental pediatrician who was more optimistic. “She’s like, ‘He’s in there. We’ll find him.’”

Today, Nick is an accomplished musician and performer. He earned his high school diploma and he’s planning to move to Florida to live with his brother and work at the gym that his brother owns. 
Nick taught himself to play the piano by ear, and he shares videos of himself playing on TikTok. His account, @nickcellamusic, is called Autistic Piano Prodigy. For Nick, the line of Kennedy’s press conference that stuck out in his mind was the assertion that autism destroys families. 
“In my opinion, that’s really false, because people who have autism, it’s not about what you have, it’s who you are on the inside, no matter what anyone says,” he said. “Like anyone who has any kind of ability, if you have Down syndrome or whatever they have, they have gifts for what they can achieve in life.”

‘Why track autistic people?’  
Taylor’s concerns about Kennedy’s rhetoric center on his announcement on May 7, a few weeks after his speech, that he would create a “real world platform” that would use insurance claims, medical records from Medicare and Medicaid and even smart watches to search for root causes of autism. 
“I don’t understand. Why track autistic people? What is the point?” Taylor said. “What are they going to do with the data? Now are we gonna have a cancer registry, an Alzheimer’s registry, a Black registry? Are you gonna have a reporter registry? That’s probably next, right? Usually when they have registries, I haven’t seen them do anything positive with it.”
Emma and her mom Pamela are also worried about the database.
“To pull out this particular group of people and really threaten that there is going to be this national database feels like such a violation of their privacy. It’s so disrespectful. There are times I think back and worry, and I wish we didn’t have this diagnosis attached to her. It’s really been stressing me out, just the thought of this database,” Pamela said. 
Kennedy says the database will help researchers quickly determine an environmental cause for autism. But according to McPartland, there is already a large database that provides researchers with information about people with ASD. That information is anonymized, and participants have to give permission for their data to be included at all. Kennedy’s announcement raises questions about how a new database would work and whether people would be able to opt out. 
Currently, it’s against the law to share medical data without a patient’s consent.
“These are things that are laws, and so the presumption is that the same laws would govern everything,” McPartland said. 
Dr. Marianne Barton, who directs the Psychological Services Clinic at the University of Connecticut, focuses primarily on identifying children with autism as early as possible in childhood. 
“What matters is people are more tuned in to this earlier. That means that children can get identified and get evaluated earlier and get intervention services earlier,” Barton said. 
In her research, Barton has followed people with ASD over a decade or two who received interventions early on. 
“We have a number of children that we identified years ago who no longer meet criteria for the diagnosis because they got intensive early intervention, and now they are functioning indistinguishable from other developing teenagers,” Barton said. 
Kennedy has insisted, including in his April speech, that there are many more incidences of autism, especially profound autism, and criticized the public and the media for attributing the rise in autism numbers to improvements in diagnosis. 
“We need to move away from … this ideology, that the autism prevalence increases, the relentless increases, are simply artifacts of better diagnoses, better recognition, or changing diagnostic criteria,” Kennedy said.
Barton, who has focused much of her work at UConn on diagnosis, said the rise in autism cases can be attributed to three components. The first is the change in how the American Psychiatric Association defines autism, particularly in 2013 when their manual did away with subcategories like Asperger’s syndrome and a group of pervasive developmental disorders and instead categorized all of these as “autism,” raising the overall number substantially. 
“It’s not the case that the majority of individuals with autism are nonfunctional, can’t support themselves, can’t hold jobs. In fact, the majority of individuals with autism, and these numbers are increasing, are very high-functioning, and that’s because of the changes in the diagnostic system,” Barton said. 
The autism community has gone to great efforts to decrease stigma to make autism a more visible and accepted kind of diagnosis, and that is, undoubtedly, contributing to the rise as well.Marianne Barton, of the Psychological Services Clinic at Uconn
Increased diagnosis has also played an important role in the rising numbers, which Barton says is a good thing. 
“Fifty percent of pediatricians are now screening for autism in toddlers, which means that we can find kids earlier and get them effective intervention. It means we are finding many, many more kids because we’re systematically looking for them,” Barton said. 
Finally, increased numbers can be attributed to improved awareness, she said. 
“The autism community has gone to great efforts to decrease stigma to make autism a more visible and accepted kind of diagnosis, and that is, undoubtedly, contributing to the rise as well.”
The elephant in the room 
Experts are worried about the potential resurgence of stigma, but Walter Glomb, the executive director of the Connecticut State Council on Developmental Disabilities, said there’s a less visible piece of the Trump administration’s actions that is likely more consequential: cuts to already anemic services for people with ASD.   
“The elephant in the room is the shortage of services and support for people with autism generally, which existed before,” Glomb said. That includes a yearslong wait list for autism services for adults in Connecticut. “My concern is: what’s the material impact of not just this rhetoric, but of the actual budget and program decisions that they’re going to make to get people services? Because we’re already behind the curve.” 
The Trump administration eliminated the Administration for Community Living in March, one of many programs cut by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which had served the elderly and disabled.
But the impact on other resources, from block grants to employment programs for people with disabilities, is still unclear, Glomb said. 
“We’re still waiting for the dust to settle, right? What they’re going to do to Medicaid and the community services types of programs, we don’t know yet,” Glomb said. 
Initial budget requests from President Donald Trump to Congress released last week show that some programs that benefit people with autism may be retained, which had Glomb feeling slightly more optimistic. But he said he was still uncertain how that budget would reconcile with the budget set by Congress.
Even before the budget becomes clear, Glomb said, there’s evidence that Kennedy’s rhetoric and moves by Congress are causing tremendous anxiety. After Kennedy’s speech, Glomb received phone calls from people in the autism community, and he recalled one from the mother of a man in his 20s who had read about Kennedy’s speech. 
“He got very upset — and some individuals on the spectrum, when they get very upset, there’s physical acting out. It’s a bad thing. When he saw the registry, he immediately assumed they were going to be tracking him. That this wasn’t about compiling data, it’s about going after those people. ‘Let’s keep an eye on people with autism.’” 
Like Glomb, Barton is concerned that there may be many more Trump administration cuts that impact people with autism. They range from the possibility that hundreds of millions of dollars from the Department of Education — much of it for special education — will be cut, to already announced cuts to grants for neurodivergent students who process information differently, which had been funded by the National Science Foundation, to cuts to autism research that had been funded by the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health. 
Scores of vaccine-related research projects were also terminated, according to data collected by Grant Watch, as has work that would have studied how early intervention can best be used to benefit young children with ASD. 
“This doesn’t even consider cuts to Medicaid, which will greatly reduce access to services,” Barton said. If that happens, she expects longer wait times for evaluations and higher costs that will disproportionately impact minority and under-resourced communities the most. “It’s not good.”
Dr. Lauren Herlihy, director of autism psychology at the Hospital for Special Care in New Britain, said that she is seeing a renewed skepticism in vaccines among patients, and is deeply concerned about the implications of fewer children getting vaccinated.
Recently, we have seen families saying, ‘I don’t want you to release this to the school. I don’t want to be on some registry of people with autism.Dr. Marianne Barton, director of Psychological Services Clinic at Uconn
“It’s kind of come back in vogue to be concerned about vaccines and autism, and as someone who diagnoses autism in young children, but in folks of all ages, there are very unfortunate situations where a child has not had any of their childhood vaccinations and they can’t get access to school programs through the public school system,” Herlihy said. In Connecticut, vaccinations are mandatory for public school attendance. 
Herlihy has seen patients who were not vaccinated and “then, they are diagnosed with autism anyway, because vaccines do not cause autism,” she said. “That to me is a major public health concern, and it puts a child at risk for some very significant medical complications related to preventable childhood illness. No patient that I’ve ever had has died from having autism, but children have died from preventable disease before vaccination.”
As to Kennedy’s claim that the database will enable researchers to pinpoint an environmental cause of autism within months, Barton said plenty of research has already been done. While many biological markers have been identified and some studies show toxins can increase the likelihood of autism in isolated circumstances, “we’re not going to find a smoking gun that is going to explain the incidence of autism. And it’s certainly not going to be vaccines.”
Barton spends a lot of time talking to parents and even adults as they embark on an autism diagnosis, which can be difficult news to hear, like it was for Pamela McKeever. But over decades of scientific and therapeutic progress and efforts to reduce stigma, the diagnosis is now greeted with relief by many families. 
Suddenly, a parent struggling to find a way to help a child through a behavioral issue, a sleep disorder or a learning challenge might have a new paradigm that allows them to access tools and therapies that can actually help. “They understand why things have been so difficult,” Barton said. 
But in the past few months, something has changed again. 
“Recently, we have seen families saying, ‘I don’t want you to release this to the school. I don’t want to be on some registry of people with autism,’” she said.
Parents who don’t want the diagnosis to be public have asked Barton’s clinic to write a report that explains what the child needs and recommendations for treatment without discussing a diagnosis of autism. 
“They are much more concerned about sharing this information,” Barton said. “That’s a direct effect of the current administration.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AUTISM-IMPACT-0520-SR-14-1024x728.jpg,,,2025-06-15 06:00:18.298691

But even with electric rates dropping this summer, it’s important to remember that when the mercury climbs, energy usage typically does too—and that’s what can cause your bill to spike.
Think of it this way: if you buy more groceries, you’d expect to pay more at checkout. If you drive your car more often than usual, you’d expect to pay more in gasoline. The more you use, the more you pay, and your energy bill is no different, as most of it is based on usage. In Connecticut, the average residential customer uses about 35% more electricity to keep cool during the summer months. Last year, due to a record-breaking summer with multiple heat waves, that increase was even greater, and customers certainly saw the change reflected in their energy bills.
While the significant increase to the Public Benefits portion of the bill in July 2024 was one of the factors that led to higher bills last summer, usage was the number-one reason for the dramatic surge customers saw. If a homeowner used the exact same amount of energy from June to July last year (approximately 700 kWh on average), their Eversource electric bill would have increased by about $8. Even though Public Benefits increased, and Standard Service (the supply rate Eversource purchased from power generators for customers) decreased substantially at the same time, many of us saw an increase far larger than $8 on our summer bills—because of higher usage.
But those are last year’s numbers. What can you expect this year? There are two rate decreases happening. The first started May 1 with the Public Benefits portion of the bill going down. An average Eversource residential customer saw their total bill decrease by approximately $13.50. Energy supply is also going down starting July 1 by about $10 for an average residential customer’s bill, but even with those two decreases, you shouldn’t be surprised to see your bill go up this summer because of increased energy usage.
How much energy you use, and therefore how much your total bill will be, depends on several factors, and weather is a big one. If blistering hot days dominate the summer months, your usage will naturally increase. Even if you keep your thermostat set at the same temperature, on a 95-degree day your system works much harder to keep your home or business cool compared to a 75-degree day, which means your usage has increased.
This may leave you wondering: is there anything I can do to help keep costs down this summer? The answer is yes. Customers can take advantage of energy efficiency measures and programs because it all adds up and makes a difference for your bottom line. Setting your thermostat one degree higher can mean your air conditioner is using one to three percent less electricity. Turning on your major appliances, like dryers and dishwashers, in the morning or late evening hours means you’re not adding heat to your home during the hottest parts of the day. Switching to LEDs means your lights are running cooler and, as a bonus, last a lot longer than incandescent lights. For the windows that get a lot of sunlight shining in, closing the blinds will also help keep your home cooler. In addition, we offer a variety of energy efficiency programs that can help lower your usage and save money on certain products, as well as financial assistance and payment plans that can help you manage your monthly bills. 
We all want to stay cool during the summer months, but that doesn’t mean you can’t stay on budget too. We hope that by sharing these tips, tools, and information about the many solutions available to our customers, we can help you accomplish both.

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)What’s behind the mask?
If you’ve seen news footage of federal immigration raids — and really, who can avoid it these days? — you may have noted how many of the agents doing the raiding are wearing masks.
More often than not, ICE agents have their faces covered with neck gaiters or balaclavas as if they were on a covert mission in Beirut. They’re outfitted in military kit as well, from tactical vests to sidearms in drop leg holsters, which all looks a bit weird when worn over T-shirts and blue jeans. But I suppose they might be going for a kind of undercover cowboy look.
But the image the masked agents convey, more than any other, is secret police.
It’s a distinctly un-American look, one that is likely to terrify the migrants being sought for deportation and just about everybody else who witnesses an ICE arrest. There might be reasons for agents to don masks when pursuing international criminals in the crime-infested back alleys of some movie Gotham, but we’re talking raids on a meatpacking plant in Omaha, a Home Depot parking lot in California, a Mexican restaurant in Kansas City. It’s part of the recent Trump administration push to deport 3,000 migrants a day.
When I heard of that quota I couldn’t help but connect it to the 3,000 deaths per day from COVID-19 at the height of the pandemic, in December 2020. It might be a coincidence, but the pandemic was the last time masks were such a cultural flash point, with conservatives fighting mask mandates as an assault on personal freedom.
Civilians wear masks as well, from anti-police protestors in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, to the white supremacist Patriot Front, which marched last month at the Liberty Memorial. Some people still wear pandemic-era masks to protect themselves from the flu and other communicable diseases. But ICE agents and law enforcement officers operating on American streets should not.
Like most of us, I had limited experience with masks before 2020.
My strongest memory of wearing a mask was when I was a kid, not yet 10 years old, waiting for Halloween to come so I could wear the scratchy plastic Superman mask with the elastic strap that invariably would snap back and sting my neck. The dime store costume was uncomfortable, just a printed plastic sheet, and that damned mask was sweaty even though it was cold outside. But there was a thrill to being somebody else for a while, to being anonymous and demanding tribute of strangers, of running up and down the streets of Baxter Springs with a paper grocery bag filled with loot.
Masks are, of course, subversive. Children know this, as do grown-up Mardi Gras revelers, bank robbers and other outlaws, Ku Klux Klan members, and the creators of comic books. According to Nobel-winning Bulgarian writer Elias Canetti, in his 1960 book “Crowds and Power,” masks are fixed and the things they represent can never change.
“It is a conclusion,” Canetti wrote. “Once the mask is in position there can be no more beginnings, no groping towards something new. The mask is clear-cut; it expresses something which is quite definite, and neither more nor less than this.” 
Everything behind the mask is mysterious, according to Canetti.
“Above all it separates,” Canetti noted. “Charged with a menace which must not be precisely known — one element of which, indeed, is the fact that it cannot be known — it comes close to the spectator, but, in spite of this proximity, remains clearly separated from him. It threatens him with the secret dammed up behind it. Unlike a face, there are no passing changes in it which can be interpreted, and so he suspects and fears the unknown that it conceals.”
In other words, it intimidates. It’s why ICE and other immigration agents have adopted the mask as an unofficial part of their uniform, not for protection but for the fear it provokes. Others in the public sphere — teachers, election officers, federal judges — haven’t resorted to hiding their faces. That’s because those professions rely on the public trust, and that’s difficult to achieve when you’re covering your face, as if in shame.
For years, there’s been a dangerous blurring of the line between law enforcement and the military. Increasingly our cops look less like they belong in Mayberry and more like they’re ready for a combat zone, with assault rifles, helmets, and mine-resistant armored vehicles. Military gear has been flowing from the federal government to state and local agencies for decades, shaping tactics and influencing culture. Federal law prohibits the military from being deployed on American soil for law enforcement duties, but so many cops resemble soldiers now that it’s difficult to tell one from the other. Immigration agents wearing masks and boiling out of unmarked vehicles just makes the situation worse.

Despite politicians who try to scare us into believing there’s an epidemic of crime in our cities, statistics show violent and property offenses have plunged since the 1990s. Instead of endangering us, most migrants are working in slaughterhouses, bussing tables, and cleaning motel rooms. You know, the kinds of jobs many Americans just don’t want. Mass deportations could trigger serious economic consequences, from higher housing prices to a shrinking economy.
In addition to the economic threat, Trump’s war on migrants also poses dangers to American democracy. The speed and manner of the deportations are limiting migrants’ access to legal representation and due process, something I wrote about a few columns back. This might not seem like a problem if you’re not a migrant at risk of deportation, but the erosion of due process won’t stop with immigration enforcement. Like a cancer, it will spread to other areas of our justice system.
Another danger has emerged with the recent immigration raids and protests in Los Angeles, and the Trump administration calling out nearly five thousand National Guard troops and U.S. Marines in response. Remember the federal law that generally forbids the use of the military in civilian law enforcement roles? It’s called the Posse Comitatus Act. The last time the act was suspended and a state’s National Guard was federalized over the wishes of its governor was in Alabama in 1968, when Lyndon Johnson invoked the Insurrection Act to enforce federal law and protect civil rights marchers. Trump has not cited the Insurrection Act, however, and his deployment of 700 Marines to Los Angeles to quell recent immigration enforcement protests adds to our growing constitutional confusion.
The difference between 1968 and today is that Johnson was acting to ensure the safety of civil rights protestors, which Gov. George Wallace refused to guarantee. Now, Trump has federalized the National Guard over the objections of California and called up the Marines not so much to restore order in Los Angeles — the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, despite some oft-repeated footage of Johnny Cabs on fire — but to add players to his chaotic immigration enforcement theater. It’s about the spectacle of power, the demonstration of force, and pushing the narrative of blue states as sanctuaries of anarchy.
The law-and-order mask of the Trump administration disguises more than just an abuse of power. The face beneath the mask is itself grotesque, the kind of racist visage that looks kindly on white South African “refugees” but which has contempt for the lamp, the door, and the brown-skinned masses yearning to breathe free. It is the face of a felon 34 times over, that of a hypocrite who pleads law and order but pardons Jan. 6 insurrectionists, that of someone who dodged the Vietnam draft on a medical pretext but who lusts for massive military parades on his birthday.
Trump turned 79 Saturday. The military spectacle of tanks and helicopters and thousands of troops — ostensibly to celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday — was estimated to have cost up to $45 million. It was an obscene waste of money, especially at a time when Veterans Administration cuts are forcing “crisis” staffing levels.
We always knew what was behind Trump’s mask. But just enough of us suspended our distrust to put him back in office. Trump is the Exxon Valdez of politics, the Typhoid Mary of bad ideas, the patron saint of the grift.

The masked federal agents enforcing Trump’s immigration agenda are a symptom not just of Trump’s political pathology, but of ours. I’m not talking about any bogus buzz phrase like “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — the only one truly deranged here is Trump himself — but of our collective political inability to recognize objective reality. It is so much easier to cast Trump as the agent of our misfortune than to address the conditions that allowed for his rise. Citizens United, for example, gave the wealthy nearly unlimited political influence and the Tea Party movement planted the seeds of today’s psycho populism. We tell pollsters the economy is the top issue but elect candidates who make our lives, fiscal and otherwise, worse.
“The oppressed,” wrote Paulo Freire, the Brazilian educator and philosopher, “having internalized the image of the oppressor and adopted his guidelines, are fearful of freedom. Freedom would require them to eject this image and replace it with autonomy and responsibility.”
Masks are fine for Halloween and Mardi Gras, but they are a poor substitute for self knowledge. I no longer want to be Superman, or any of the pop figures I’ve worshipped in the years since that sweaty and greedy Halloween, but I long now to be myself.
I long for America to be itself.
We must remove our own masks and contemplate the living, hopeful, and changeable human faces beneath. We share the same basic needs — economic security, access to affordable health care, a sense of belonging, meaningful endeavor — and yet we have a remarkable capacity for uniquely expressing those desires. I sometimes fall into the trap of thinking nothing we can do individually will make a difference, yet I forget that collectively we are America, that for good or ill the choices are ours. We can give up. Or we can work together for a better tomorrow.
But first, we must all drop the masks.

Here’s my list of overnight travel options, from worst to first:


DRIVING ALL NIGHT: In my carefree youth I once drove all night from Chicago to New York City.  Tired and wired (on a lot of coffee) I encountered no traffic and made really good time, but arrived exhausted.  Not a good option… and probably not safe.
SLEEPING IN THE AIRPORT: This one doesn’t really count, as you’re not really traveling.  And those not-so-comfy chairs at the gate don’t really allow much sleep.
The good news is that many airports (ATL, DFW, JFK) now offer Minute Suites with daybeds and showers. You can book them for an hour ($48) or for an eight-hour overnight ($175).
SLEEPING ON THE PLANE: It’s not by chance that overnight flights are called “red eyes.”  Sure, flying overnight is fast, but if you’re sitting in coach on a crowded plane, good luck with any shut-eye.  This is why I hate flying to Europe.  You arrive jet lagged, in a different time zone and anxious to just sleep, not go sight-seeing.
Now, if you’re in business class, rest is possible… at a price.  And if money is no object, there are ultra-luxe accommodations like on Air France’s La Premiere, a private suite ten-feet square with three-star gourmet meals curated by Michelin-starred chefs, served on porcelain with Christofle cutlery… and a full bed.  Roundtrip fare JFK-Paris, about $20,000.
TAKING THE BUS: “Riding the dog” (Greyhound) is not my idea of fun anytime, but there are some private companies re-thinking bus travel with much comfier accommodations. In Texas, Vonlane offers “luxury motor coaches” with business class seating.  Similar service between New York City and Washington, D.C. is offered by private carriers, but not on the overnights.
TRAVEL BY SHIP:  Alas, not many options here aside from cruising or crossing the Atlantic.  But in the old days, there were steamboats plying the waters between Hartford and New York City.  As I wrote a few months back, the 14-18 hour journey had both “deck class” and cabin class accommodations.
TRAVEL BY TRAIN: Not surprising that this is my favorite option.  But as with flying, if you’re stuck in coach class your slumber may be less than optional.  Amtrak offers bedrooms… from Roomettes to Bedroom Suites… but they’re always booked weeks in advance and are far too expensive.

There are several start-ups looking to offer much nicer (and affordable) sleeping cars, like Dreamstar which hopes to launch next year between San Francisco and Los Angeles.  And Lunatrain, running New York City to Atlanta and Chicago.
We’ll have to see if either company is successful in its launch, modeled after the highly popular NightJet train service you’ll find throughout Europe. Even in Japan, the country that launched true high-speed rail 50 years ago, there are sleeper trains offering everything from cabins to tatami mats.
So, as you plan your summer travels, check out these options.  You’ll save on hotel rooms and maybe have an adventure!",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/driving-overnight.jpg,,,2025-06-15 04:56:49.021281

In Anchorage, a crowd lined L Street holding handmade signs, waving flags and cheering, as cars honked in support. 
Stephanie Schulling held a protest sign reading, “no sign is big enough for all the reasons I’m here.” She said as a social worker, she feels an ethical responsibility to show up and protest “the issues with people being disappeared, the issues with DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency), the issues with the possibility of Medicaid, Social Security, you know, all those sorts of safety nets going away. It’s unthinkable.”

Signs and speeches from community advocates condemned the Trump administration as overreaching its power and authority, and called for protecting democracy and equal rights, including for immigrant and transgender communities. The crowd then marched along L Street to the Delaney Park Strip for an afternoon Juneteenth celebration. 
“People are really, really scared, and I think their fear has turned into action,” said Erin Jackson-Hill, an organizer and executive director of Stand Up Alaska, a nonprofit social justice organization. 
“In Alaska especially, we really hold on to our freedoms and our independence, and we’re not gonna bow down to a king,” she said. “And so the ‘No Kings’ march is a way to stand up and say, ‘We don’t have kings in this country, we don’t want a king!’ The country got founded because we didn’t want a king. And we certainly don’t want Donald Trump to be the king.” 
More than 2,000 No Kings protest events were planned on Saturday nationwide. Social media posts show No Kings rallies in at least 24 Alaska communities from Ketchikan to Seldovia to Bethel and a single protester in the village of Emmonak on the Yukon River holding a sign reading “No Kings, only salmon.”
Several protest participants spoke with the Alaska Beacon after events wrapped up on Saturday afternoon, and expressed appreciation for Alaskans showing up to demonstrate and denounce Trump.

In Nome, several dozen people demonstrated under the iconic Burled Arch and finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog race. “We have no place for a monarchy or any king-type of government and you know, people wanted to make their voices heard,” said Hannah Anderson, a participant and 50-year resident of Nome. She said it was especially great to see that sentiment echoed on social media posts from across rural Alaska. 
“Because living off the road system in Alaska, it’s kind of easy to feel forgotten or feel kind of alone out here,” she said. “And by seeing other people expressing their view and opinion is important, and pretty nice.”
In Homer, a large crowd rallied downtown, in one of the biggest protests seen by Ron Keffer, a retired educator and participant. “There was a really big turnout today,” he said, estimating the crowd at well above 1,000.
“I’m not afraid at this moment,” he added. “I think this is a moment when this country has had to examine itself, and it’s found some rotten spots in the apple, some really rotten spots. We have some very unlovely tendencies amongst some parts of our country, more than we realize: the racism, the misogyny, … the antagonism toward immigrants, which is our lifeblood. So it’s a big reckoning. And it’s going to make us better. It won’t feel good for a while. It’s kind of like surgery, it doesn’t feel good for a while, but the outcome is going to be good in the long run.”
In Palmer, where a few hundred people rallied, safety for demonstrators was the top priority, said Dave Musgrave, an organizer with the activist group Mat-Su United for Progress. He said the group came prepared after there were threats on social media of armed counterprotesters. 
“We had 30 peacekeepers who had de-escalation training. We were walking the sidewalks making sure everybody knew what their de-escalation techniques were,” he said. “And guess what? The counterprotesters really didn’t show up in force, in spite of what they put all over social media. So we stood strong and resolute, but we were all very peaceful.”
He said there were about eight counterprotesters there that organizers spoke with amicably, and there was no disruption. “We had beyond just our grannies and grandpas,” he added. “We had some great-grannies and great-grandpas too. But we also had a lot of young people show up, and it was great to see them out there too, fighting for their community and fighting against authoritarianism.”
Well above 1,000 people rallied under rare sunny skies in Juneau, according to organizers there, with a small group of counterprotesters nearby.
Organizers say protests are ongoing, with some groups holding weekly demonstrations, and say they will continue to make their voices heard protesting the Trump administration.

More than 60 are at the Lincoln County facility pending further proceedings, a statement said.
Three Mexican natives here without proper legal status signed paperwork to voluntarily return to their home country.
Three workers from Guatemala were transferred to Alexandria, Louisiana, in preparation for their removal from the country. Among them, one has a final order of removal that had been issued in 2019, one has been removed from the country on four previous occasions and another has three DUIs and one illegal reentry conviction, according to an ICE statement.
Mark Zito, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Kansas City, a jurisdiction that covers Omaha, again pushed back on what he called a false narrative — that “these are just hardworking immigrants looking for the American dream.” 
Zito called that “ludicrous.”
“These crimes have lasting effects,” he said, saying the “real victims” may be left to deal with years of frustration trying to restore their identities.
ICE has said the raid at Glenn Valley Foods was predicated on the suspicion that many workers at the plant used stolen or fraudulent identification to gain employment.
The raid was highly publicized, as federal officials also allowed a national news outlet into the plant to video it. 
The raid set off several anti-ICE and Trump administration protests in Omaha, including one Friday near the NCAA men’s College World Series. Organizers of that march and rally, which drew several hundred people, wanted a national backdrop to let their message be heard.
Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa “No Kings” rallies and others across the country protested what they call authoritarian overreach by the Trump administration.

The Salt Lake City Police Department is investigating a shooting that occurred during a “No Kings” protest Saturday night near 200 S. State Street, and officials are urging people to disperse the demonstration in an orderly fashion.

“We can confirm the shooting resulted in one person being critically injured,” the department posted on X at 8:29 p.m. “The patient has been taken to a hospital with life-threatening injures.” 

A Utah News Dispatch reporter that was on scene saw the crowd scatter, with some shouting that they heard gunshots. A photojournalist also witnessed what appeared to be a victim lying in the street with several people administering aid. Soon after, the victim was seen being loaded into an ambulance.
The police department also said officers had a “person of interest in custody.” 
They urged people to leave the demonstration “safely and orderly.”

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Across Maine and coast-to-coast, people took to the streets on Saturday for a day of action condemning the actions of President Donald Trump, who spent the day celebrating his 79th birthday with a multi-million dollar military parade in Washington, D.C..
More than three dozen “No Kings” events were organized across the state, in small towns and big cities, where thousands turned out to march. 
Starting the day in York, U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree handed out red roses to marchers. 
“People are angry, they want to know what to do, want to do something, they want to fight back,” she said. 
Eighty-eight year old Roberta Herschberg, who said she spent every summer of her life in York, joked about her age, saying, “Personally I’ve been fighting kings since 1775.”
Lyman resident Craig Carscallen was among the crowd lining Main Street in Kennebunk. He said he hopes the widespread protests “influences our elected officials, if they want to get reelected”. 
An estimated 3,000 people rallied outside the State House in Augusta, according to the Press Herald, and in Portland, another 3,000 rallied in Monument Square and Lincoln Park.
Protesters rallied at more than 1,500 sites across the country as of mid-afternoon, according to No Kings national organizers. Many focused on the Trump administration’s aggressive expansion of immigration raids and enforcement, including the deployment of troops to Los Angeles in defiance of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom. 
The day of action was colored by the killing of a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband, who were assassinated in their home in an “act of political violence,” according to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

Trump is seeking to militarize the approach of the more than half a million sworn police officers charged with protecting and serving communities across the country.  
The post Making war in US communities: Trump executive order on policing threatens to set public safety back decades   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","PRESIDENT TRUMP’S reckless order to deploy National Guard and Marine forces to Los Angeles, where protests recently broke out over ICE arrests of immigrants, has rightly drawn indignation as well as legal challenge. His unilateral decision to send military personnel into a US city, bypassing the role of the state’s governor in authorizing use of the National Guard, is the latest sign of the creeping authoritarianism taking hold in Trump’s second term.  
But another Trump initiative ostensibly concerned with public safety is ultimately even more troubling than his effort to have military personnel — trained for warfare — deployed to handle domestic law enforcement. Trump is also seeking to militarize the approach of the more than half a million sworn police officers charged with protecting and serving communities across the country every day.  
Amid the nonstop flurry of executive orders Trump has issued since returning to the White House is one related to policing that has received scant attention. It should set off alarms among everyone, starting with dedicated police officers themselves, who is committed to public safety and best practices in law enforcement.  
In the 879-word executive order, issued in late April, Trump practically previewed his recent deployment of military personnel to Los Angeles. The order, titled “Strengthening and Unleashing America’s Law Enforcement to Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens,” is rooted in Project 2025, the omnibus plan of the radical right, published by The Heritage Foundation and aimed at remaking American government and society. 
The executive order calls for a militarized police service in the US, one that essentially operates under martial law. In the order, Trump says the attorney general and secretary of defense, working in consultation with the secretary of homeland security and other agencies, “shall increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement.” It calls on the attorney general and defense secretary to “determine how military and national security assets, training, non-lethal capabilities, and personnel can most effectively be utilized to prevent crime.”  
It further calls on the attorney general to “take all appropriate action to create a mechanism to provide legal resources and indemnification to law enforcement officers who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law. This mechanism shall include the use of private-sector pro bono assistance for such law enforcement officers.” (So, we now know one of the “causes” the Trump administration intends to assign to the high-priced law firms they pressured into offering free legal services.) 
Perhaps most troubling is the order’s effort to undo the crucial role the federal government has played in monitoring troubled local police departments. It orders the attorney general to review, within 60 days, all ongoing consent decrees, a key instrument used by the Department of Justice to remedy systemic civil rights violations in individual police departments, and to “modify, rescind, or move to conclude such measures that unduly impede the performance of law enforcement functions.”  
Far from fulfilling his vow to make a positive difference for public safety, Trump’s order would wipe out four decades of crime-reduction strategies and improvements in the overall quality of policing in US communities. During that time, we have seen dramatic reductions in violent crime across the country. The president bases his actions on the falsehood he continually repeats that crime is escalating in America’s neighborhoods. He portrays US cities, especially those in blue states, as post-apocalyptic, violent fantasy lands. (Historically, violent crime has been highest in the very red South.) 
Many people in public life, including police themselves, have used martial terms as either metaphors or descriptors, however inapt, in discussing policing. For decades we have claimed to be waging a “war on crime,” while simultaneously carrying out a “war on drugs.” Yet, as the late policing scholar George Kelling told me, “so-called ‘crime-fighting’ failed completely to reduce crime, the outcome it promised.” Indeed, crime and martial rhetoric rose in tandem with one another from the 1950s into the late 1990s.  
But the Trump strategy aims to take all the war talk into a new realm, seeking to transform American police departments into something that more closely resembles armed forces units patrolling our neighborhoods.  
The tone and language of the order are angry and threatening. “Unleashing” suggests officers snarling and growling at suspects, necks strained against the leash of what it says are “‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ initiatives that restrict law enforcement activity or endanger citizens.” In the order, the president calls on officers to police more “aggressively,” “tenaciously,” and “firmly,” the clear message being that they should be unchecked by laws and left-wingers. Departments are to be provided war-making equipment and supported in their military approach by undefined “surge resources.”  
The order’s talk of “indemnification” for police threatens local and state elected officials for what the president sees as unfair treatment of police personnel accused of violating laws and procedures. In his telling, officers under investigation for any sort of alleged misconduct or wrongdoing are ipso facto the victims, “wrongly accused and abused by State or local officials.” 
One can readily insert the terms “Massachusetts” and “Boston” into the executive order where he directs the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute state and local officials who, in the view of Trump’s Justice Department, are interfering in some way with law enforcement.  
The order to rescind federal consent decrees overseeing police departments is a grave disservice to, and indeed a threat to the safety of, the hundreds of thousands of good cops who show up each day and night trying to do the right thing. The progress we have made, in Massachusetts and across the country, in operating departments that are responsive to and respectful of the communities they serve is rooted in a commitment to community-police collaboration. Pitting police and communities against one another makes everyone less safe. 
The subject and language of presidential pronouncements are always highly consequential. When it comes to the subject of policing, we have firsthand experience of that in Boston.  
When President Clinton visited Boston in 1997 to highlight the city’s efforts – based on strong police-community collaboration — to reduce youth firearm violence, he said he wanted to “give every community the tools that you have used to make your city safe again so that we can do it everywhere in America.”  
That presidential attention spurred a change in public safety practice across the country, as formerly siloed operations evolved into today’s collaborations among police, clergy, probation officers, and many others. Under the current president’s executive order, these advances will be trampled underfoot by reducing the comprehensive approach to public safety to a single tactic: aggressive enforcement by police, shoulder to shoulder with armed forces units. 
Trump’s words appear designed to remake our understanding of what actually works to reduce and prevent crime and harm in our communities. Decades of experience and research have demonstrated the value of collaborative prevention strategies involving police and many additional stakeholders. Collaboration confers legitimacy, making police more effective, especially in communities with historically poor relationships with law enforcement.  
This call for aggression may have its most immediate, dangerous impacts in the president’s bellicose approach to arresting and detaining undocumented immigrants, as in Los Angeles. ICE activity recently put Worcester police in the middle of a difficult situation, when rough tactics used by ICE agents in an action last month sparked a community backlash. The police had to arrest local citizens in order to protect ICE personnel from the community. More recently, Milford residents protested the arrest of high school student Marcelo Gomes da Silva on his way to volleyball practice. We can expect to see more community reactions of this kind as ICE continues its campaign.   
The great irony of Trump’s muscular call for militarized law and order is that he has long denigrated the very ideas about law and justice that helped to drive the American Revolution and the framing of much of the Massachusetts and US constitutions. He disparages the independent judiciary, attacks the sanctity of trial by a jury of one’s peers, and dismisses the presumption of innocence.  
The police service his order envisions could well be clad in redcoats, rounding up anyone who has displeased the king. As the Boston of the Adamses, Hancock, and Crispus Attucks sorely vexed George III, the Boston of Wu vexes the White House in our time.  
Trump has made an art form of pandering with his words to police officers’ genuine concerns about their safety, but then contradicting himself in deed. His pardon of people who attacked and led to the deaths of US Capitol Police officers on January 6, 2021, is only the most obvious example. More recently, he praises police in speeches for their great work, but sends in the armed forces to make up for their make-believe shortcomings in managing crime and disorder.  
The danger of all this is in the power of the bully pulpit. Falsehoods repeated often enough have a way of becoming not only perceived as facts, but the underpinning for reckless public policy. 
Jim Jordan is the retired director of strategic planning at the Boston Police Department. He has taught police strategy at Northeastern University, the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and in training settings around the country.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Thousands of Kansans rallied Saturday at the Statehouse in Topeka as part of a nationwide backlash to President Donald Trump, hoisting signs, joining in pro-democracy chants and speaking out against immigration raids.
Organizers for the “No Kings” rally repeatedly urged the crowd to remain peaceful as demonstrators filled the south lawn of the Statehouse grounds. A lively contingent on the edge of the rally shouted insults at a small pro-Trump gathering across the street, but the event was otherwise peaceful.
The rally featured speeches from advocates and candidates for office, including Kansas Sen. Cindy Holscher, an Overland Park Democrat who announced she is running for governor, and Christy Davis, a former federal rural development official who revealed she is exploring a run for U.S. Senate.
The crowd sang the national anthem and recited the Pledge of Allegiance, ending with an emphatic “for all.”
And the crowd cheered when Melissa Stiehler and Davis Hammet, prominent advocates for voting and LGBTQ+ rights, made a surprise brief appearance in formal wedding attire before leaving to get married elsewhere in town.

The Topeka rally was among protests all over the country to oppose the president’s plan for a military display in Washington, D.C., on his own birthday, as well as mass immigration arrests. Organizers said more than 5,000 people joined in the Topeka rally. Other rallies were held elsewhere in Kansas.
Mary Smith, of Geary County, held a sign that read: “Elect a rapist expect to be f***ed” and “Donny the quicker f***er upper.”
Smith said she had never protested anything before Trump’s second term in office but that she was concerned about “all the atrocities that Trump is trying to do to us.” She said she was especially concerned about the deportation tactics being used against immigrants.
“It’s getting a little ridiculous,” Smith said. “He’s only four and a half months into his presidency, and I’m afraid it’s gonna get worse from here.”

Lee Boyd, of Lawrence, said she rushed back from an unrelated event in Kalamazoo, Michigan, so she could get to the Topeka rally in time.
She grabbed a seat in the flower garden on the south lawn, holding a small sign that read, “Tax the rich.”
“I feel pretty strongly about this dictatorship that we’re under, and I also am quite concerned about the defunding of National Public Radio and PBS,” Boyd said.
Describing himself as an old hippie, Alan Schmidt, of Hoyt, sported a tie-dyed shirt and carried an upside down American flag.
“Our nation is in distress, and I want to be part of the voice that says this is not OK,” Schmidt said.
Schmidt was one of several people to display an upside-down flag, which caught the attention of the handful of men carrying pro-Trump signs across the street on the south edge of the rally. The men refused to provide their full names.

“I’ve never seen so many ignorant people in my life,” said a man who would only identify himself as Jeff. “Every one of those signs, there’s no facts at all on them. None. Period.”
Another man said: “If you’re just fake news, admit it and move on.”
At one point, a woman carrying two Mexican flags and one reading “F*** Trump” positioned herself directly in front of the men to block their view of the rally.
Meanwhile, a woman carrying a “Viva Trump” sign waded into the rally crowd, where several people physically shoved her and demanded she leave.
Some of the “No Kings” rally-goers taunted the pro-Trump demonstrators with shouts across the street:
“Why are there only five of you?”
“F*** you fascists.”
“Your flag was made in China.”
“Migrants make America great.”

Back toward the Statehouse steps, Mac Farish, who was visiting from Portland, Oregon, held a large sign that read “we the people outnumber your cabinet 16,513,850 to 1” on one side and showed a picture of a cat toying with a king’s crown on the other side.
The number references the ratio of U.S. residents to the president’s advisers.
“There is so much wrong with what is happening,” she said, “and if I’m completely frank, I went to school to study public policy and political science, and I feel like my degree has completely been wasted because they washed away what I studied for four years.”
She said she spent more than $100,000 on her degree at the University of Alabama, “and all of a sudden the constitution doesn’t matter, nothing matters anymore.”
Farish said she felt joy to see so many people attend a “No Kings” rally in a red state.
“A lot of people here might be lifelong Republicans, but we’re standing here together because there is a line where tyranny shows up,” Farish said.
“It’s really not hard to love other people,” she added. “It’s really not hard to care.”

The protests took place on the same day as a military parade held in Washington D.C. on President Donald Trump’s birthday and the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army and in the wake of the Trump administration’s escalated response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions in Los Angeles. 
‘We will fight joyfully’: Thousands march through downtown Madison to protest Trump 
Thousands of people crowded into downtown Madison Saturday afternoon joining the nationwide “No Kings” protests against the administration of President Donald Trump. 
Protesters waved American flags right side up and upside down (a traditional signal of distress), as well as LGBTQ pride flags, Mexican flags and Ukrainian flags. Signs called for equality, criticized Immigration and Customs Enforcement and  compared Trump to dictators of the past. The crowd included trapeze artists, people in drag, Madison protest regulars the “Raging Grannies,” a 15-foot Statue of Liberty puppet and U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia).

The protest started on UW-Madison’s east Campus Mall, where the Women’s March hosted a “kick out the clowns” event. There, Madison resident Amanda G., who declined to give her last name, did hand stands on the grass next to a sign stating “hand stand against facism.” 
“When people engage in a struggle against facism, you need calm, focus and concentration,” she said, adding that those same qualities  are required for holding a hand stand as long as she could. 
A nearby group of protesters performed a  skit featuring giant paper mache heads of Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin debating how to start a dictatorship before they were surrounded by about 15 dancers dressed like the Statue of Liberty. 
When  the protesters began marching from the campus toward the Capitol,  hundreds of people were still flowing in the opposite direction  down State Street.  The combined crowd came together and headed  up the street towards the Capitol as onlookers cheered from the sidewalks. 
Madison police observed the marchers as they gathered at the Capitol from a rooftop across the street.
Cindy Reilly, a Sun Prairie resident who had joined the crowd on the mall, watched and chanted from the patio of a State Street bar. Reilly said the budget bill currently being moved through Congress by Republicans was her biggest reason for protesting on Saturday, saying Republicans are defunding programs that help people who are struggling while funding rich people.

“It’s important for people to tell Trump and Republicans we don’t like what they’re doing,” she said.

When the crowd reached the Capitol square, Nick Ramos, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, emceed a series of performances and speeches.
“We will fight joyfully, we will fight peacefully, in these streets for our democracy” Ramos said.
Georgia Sen. Rafael Warnock, who was in Wisconsin to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s annual convention in the Wisconsin Dells this weekend, spoke from the protest stage and  highlighted the assassination of a Minnesota Democratic lawmaker Saturday morning, the deployment of U.S. troops against protesters in Los Angeles and the detainment of U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-California) at a Department of Homeland Security press conference this week. 
Warnock said that he often talks about the value of nonviolent protests, but it’s not protesters who are being violent. 
“I have said that to the activists,” Warnock said. “But somebody needs to say that to the Trump administration.”

Throughout the first six months of the Trump administration, people have regularly called for more forceful opposition from elected Democrats. Warnock acknowledged those calls, while saying it will take work from people inside and outside the halls of power to fight Trump’s unpopular policies. 
“People like you are asking people in positions like mine to speak up,” Warnock said. “I’m going to do that, but we must work on the outside and the inside.” 
Protests wrap around multiple city blocks in Milwaukee 
More than  12,000 people  marched in the No Kings Day protest in Milwaukee, packing  Cathedral Square Saturday afternoon. Elderly people and military veterans, parents with young children and Milwaukee residents of all ages  turned out to denounce what some event speakers described as a fascist and authoritarian Trump administration. 
Most of the crowd gathered on  the grass at the center of the square in front of  a large stage while  others stood off to the side in the  shade. Law enforcement kept a low key profile during the protest, helping direct traffic and watching from rooftops. Several drones flew over the crowd throughout the protest, including some which legal observers believed were operated by law enforcement due to their size, complexity and because they seemed to land on the rooftops occupied by police.

For nearly an hour, the crowd listened to a procession of speakers including  local activists, community organizers and a retired U.S. attorney. Speakers expressed the grievances of the chanting, cheering crowd about the military parade being held in Washington, D.C.,  the deployment of active duty U.S.troops on American soil, immigration raids  and attacks on the judicial system including the arrest of Milwaukee Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, as well as threatened cuts to reproductive and gender affirming health care, attacks on workers rights, and the ongoing mass slaughter of civilians in Gaza. The crowd observed a moment of silence for Minnesota Democratic legislative leader Melissa Hortman who was the victim of a targeted assassination Saturday in what appeared to be a politically motivated attack.  
The protest march proceeded  east towards Lake Michigan and  past Museum Center Park, winding back into the downtown area to pass the federal courthouse, and restaurant-lined streets before returning to Cathedral Square. 
The march stretched for several city blocksThere was no evidence of property destruction or clashes with police , and counter protesters were nowhere in sight.

The suspect, now identified as Vance Boelter, was still at large as droves arrived at the march’s staging area at St. Paul College. People were sharing updates and making safety plans with each other. Most decided to stay even as the Minnesota State Patrol posted on X that “No Kings” signs were found in the suspect’s car and that the public should not attend the protest.
Amelia Nelson, 22, came to protest with her mother and her grandmother, Joan Nelson, 82. “We’re in such dire times, it feels like the end times for me honestly. But it was important for me to come out, I wanted to experience the community.”
Joan Nelson said today’s movement was only the second protest she’s attended in her life. She said she came away with “hope, some hope. There were a lot of people, a lot of good messages. Fight on, don’t give up. There will be times when there are people we may lose, but still we fight on.”

The rally was suffused with tension. Some people scrutinized law enforcement and discussed among themselves whether their badges and patches were legitimate. Demonstrators alerted press and each other to any vehicles or people they thought might be suspicious. Phones were open to news updates.

The day of protest purposely coincides with a military parade in D.C. Saturday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.
Some scheduled speakers, including Gov. Tim Walz and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, did not appear in the wake of the Hortman and Hoffman shootings, but community leaders, musicians, and poets still gave speeches and led the crowd in chants. Several said blessings for the memory of Hortman.

Vermonters turned out in force around the state Saturday as part of the nationwide “No Kings Day” protests, championing myriad causes but generally united behind opposing President Donald Trump.
As Washington, D.C., geared up for a military parade to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Army and celebrate President Trump’s 79th birthday, 1,800 events unfolded across the country to protest the Trump administration as part of the “No Kings Day” of national mobilization.
Burlington saw one of its biggest protests in recent years. Geri Peterson, lead organizer with the activist network 50501, said 8,000 people signed up to participate in the rally on the Burlington waterfront. But as everyone gathered in front of the stage set up for the event, she said the crowd grew to over 16,000 people based on the group’s drone footage.

People showed up for different reasons: protecting democracy, standing up for immigrants, protesting the Trump administration’s budget and program cuts, showing solidarity with Palestine, upholding LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights and more.
“I’m scared that we’re going to lose democracy and we’re going to be under an authoritarian regime, and I don’t get scared easily,” said Brant Dinkin from Williston.
“I have a pent-up sadness about what’s going on in the country and taking action is the antidote to sadness, so I get up, I stand up and I show up and that’s what we’re all doing here today,” said Dinkin.
Jennifer Overton from West Berlin said she is worried about potential cuts to Medicaid, a government program providing health insurance for people with limited resources, as both her personal health and work as a therapist depend on it. 
“I’m on Medicaid and I will most certainly lose it, and that could be a death sentence for me,” Overton said, explaining that she’s diabetic and most of her clients are on Medicaid, so she would lose a big part of her income if the program was cut.
“I fear for my country. I deeply fear. I fear for her,” said Lorraine Zaloom, a resident of Essex, pointing to her niece. “She’s adopted. She’s done everything right. She has to carry her documents around.”
The protest in Burlington unfolded peacefully Saturday. Around noon, more people marched to the waterfront holding Palestinian flags and chanting “from Palestine to Mexico, those border walls have got to go.” As the lawn filled with people, speakers began taking the stage.
Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University student previously arrested by ICE during an interview to obtain U.S. citizenship, shared his experience growing up in a refugee camp under the Israeli government and witnessing the killing of his best friend. He said the solidarity and love of Vermonters helped him heal from the trauma he experienced.
“We see the fires in California and the violence, and it’s like a spark, and if we don’t put it down, any spark of violence here, the fire will spread,” said Mahdawi. “We have to put it down with love and care. We have to keep guarding our communities.”
Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., Vermont’s lone member in the U.S. House of Representatives, also spoke to the crowd: “Today is an urgent call for every American, no matter who you voted for, no matter if you voted at all,” she said.

Balint referenced how Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., was recently taken to the ground and zip-tied by Homeland Security agents after interrupting a press conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
“He was doing his work — his responsibility to do oversight over Homeland Security,” Balint said. “If they will do that to a man with that much power, what are they doing to the least among us?”
Balint denounced the threats and harassment faced by students, residents and migrant workers and encouraged people to continue organizing and resisting. 
“We, today, are creating community by doing this important work together” she said, “and we will use it to push back against policies that don’t serve us, against politicians who divide us, against people who want to keep us down. That’s why we are out here today.”
Meanwhile, in Montpelier, the Statehouse lawn was teeming with over a thousand people attending the capital city’s “No Kings” protest.Organizers from Montpelier Strong Indivisible and Calais Indivisible substituted speakers for singers and asked the crowd to sing along to protest songs and religious hymns performed by Solidarity Singers, a political music group.The rally remained peaceful throughout as organizers urged the crowd to remain nonviolent and to not engage with any potential hecklers or counter-protesters.
Ron Dufresne, a veteran, said attending the rally was part of his military duty.
“I came to the protest today because we have to reclaim our country. I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution as a U.S. Army officer, and I take that oath very seriously. I see this administration trampling on the Constitution. Our country will only be strong if we, the people, reclaim our devotion to the Constitution and rule of law.”Toward the back of the protest Mackenzie Kovaka had a small easel set up in front of her as she painted a miniature watercolor portrait of the day’s events. 
“I paint a lot. It’s part of being present and here, and it’s the way that I like to experience things… and I’m really concerned about the direction of the country,” Kovaka said.
For Kim Rae, protesting was personal. Her son Ash has used a wheelchair since he was 8 years old. Ash relies on Medicaid dollars to provide a home health aid to help him in his daily life. President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” now making its way through Congress, would cut an estimated $600 billion from Medicaid, according to PBS.“If Medicaid gets cut he won’t be able to survive independently in his own home,” Rae said.
The rally ended with organizers leading a large march toward downtown Montpelier, calling for people to join them later on at the Burlington protest if they could.
More than 40 events were held around the state Saturday, including a border-to-border anti-Trump flag parade that traveled up Route 7 from Massachusetts to Canada. Vermonters honked and waved along the route as the parade passed by. At least 15 communities outside of the parade route held their own anti-Trump protests.

MONTPELIER — A Republican Flag Day gathering in front of the Vermont Statehouse ended in a frosting fiasco Saturday after a cake was destroyed and a man was shoved.The intention of the gathering was to celebrate “Flag Day, the 250th Anniversary of the U.S. Army, (and) President Donald Trump’s 79th Birthday!” according to the Vermont Republican Party’s online calendar. The celebration was scheduled to start just an hour after the anti-Trump “No Kings” protest hosted in the same location. 
The event was hosted by Gregory Thayer, a notable Republican voice in Vermont politics who ran against Lt. Gov. John Rodgers in last year’s Republican primary.

The violence began when Matthew Baker came up to the table as Thayer was speaking and smushed his water bottle into the cake that read “Happy Birthday U.S Flag, U.S. Army + President Trump.” Thayer then turned and shoved the man, as other pro-Trump attendees rushed to Thayer’s aid. Thayer then threw the water bottle, which struck Baker’s chest.
“He smashed the cake with a water bottle. I grabbed him to push him away, and then I walked away ’cause other people converged on him. Then, the water bottle was sitting in the middle of the cake and I gave him back his water bottle. That’s pretty much it,” Thayer said.“I just dipped this in their cake, and then they grabbed the bottom and threw it at me, in the chest,” Baker said. “I wanted to see how they would react, and I got what I expected, violence. I got this bottle thrown at me.”

Security officers separated the men, and police officers showed up promptly after the initial cake-clash.Despite the bottle, the cake was still served, though the event ended about 10 minutes early.The event started peacefully enough, with Thayer and around 30 pro-Trump supporters in attendance gathered around a table with a microphone and the cake.

The peace was short-lived, however, as minutes into the event the first arguments started. A young woman in a pink shirt and a man in a fireman’s jacket holding a Trump 2024 flag began to argue about immigration.Then, a woman holding a “Chinga La Migra” poster who was a stayover from the prior “No Kings” rally ran around to distract pro-Trump speakers, who returned with chants like “Becca Balint get in line, learn to wipe your own behind!”Arguments between event attendees and anti-Trump protesters punctuated the entirety of the event.As tensions escalated between the pro and anti-Trump groups, Thayer made a move toward civility by calling up an older, liberal woman to the microphone.

The woman asked attendees to find someone with whom they disagreed but could have a reasonable conversation with. It appeared neither crowd was listening, though, as both sides shouted over the woman — at one point while she was speaking, someone let off an airhorn — when she asked attendees to put their hands on their head if they thought her proposition was a good idea. Only she and Thayer did so. Tonya Cicio attended the event to celebrate President Trump’s birthday and the 250th anniversary of the U.S. army, as her son is in the Navy. 
“We’ve been supporting Trump since before the election … There’ll never be another president like him again — never,” Cicio said.

The protest and march drew over 1,000 attendees, according to event organizers (Michael Baniewicz/Missourian).Thousands turned out in Columbia, Jefferson City and dozens of towns across Missouri on Saturday to join a nationwide mobilization against the expansion of executive power by the president.
The “No Kings” demonstrations took place in all 50 states, with at least 30 rallies in Missouri, from Columbia to St. Louis, Kansas City to Cape Girardeau, Springfield to St. Joseph, and around the steps of the Missouri Capitol in Jefferson City.
The widespread national movement came after more than a week of demonstrations against federal immigration raids, largely in Los Angeles where President Donald Trump activated the National Guard and U.S. Marines over the authority of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Saturday’s protests were timed to match a military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army and coinciding with Trump’s 79th birthday.
In St. Louis, news outlets reported that thousands participated in at least a dozen rallies in the city and the county, while thousands more marched in Kansas City, 2,000 lined the streets in Springfield and several hundred turned out in Joplin.
In addition to the rallies in U.S. cities, including in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Houston and Los Angeles, there were gatherings in Europe, Africa, Asia and South America.
Gov. Mike Kehoe announced Thursday that he was activating the Missouri National Guard ahead of the planned rallies but indicated they would be mobilized only if “assistance is needed to support local law enforcement.”
But organizers nationwide vowed to keep the protests peaceful, and very little disturbance or police presence was observed in Columbia and central Missouri.
 Around the Courthouse Plaza in Columbia

 Hundreds of people gather for the “No Kings” protest Saturday at Boone County Courthouse in Columbia. The crowd sat in the warm sun as they listened to multiple speeches and chanted slogans (Kate Cassady/Missourian).
The atmosphere at the Boone County Courthouse in Columbia was upbeat Saturday as at least 1,000 people gathered to express their frustrations with the Trump administration.
Friends and neighbors mingled while speeches and live music filled the courthouse amphitheater, making the protest feel more like a block party than a demonstration.
Cars passing on Walnut Street answered protesters’ signs with honks of support. In the shade of the plaza parking garage, a hot dog stand sold food and drinks, while more protesters watched and waved American flags from the top floor of the garage.
Flags, signs and apparel at the protest were representative of the diverse range of people who showed up and the variety of grievances they have with Trump.
Chants in support of women and transgender rights were popular, and a number of signs focused on accusations of sexual misconduct against the president. Many brought American flags, some displayed upside down in an act traditionally used to signal distress.
During the rally, Ken Pearson said he was offended by Trump using his wealth and status to avoid military service.
“But beyond that, I think he’s a real threat to our democratic institutions,” said Pearson, who is a U.S. Army veteran.
Amy Lovelady came with her daughter to the protest to set an example.
“At this moment in our history if we’re silent, then we’re complacent,” Lovelady said.
Her daughter, Laila, added: “I just want everyone to be equal, and I want to have equality for everyone. It’s liberty and justice for all.”
Many people also expressed concerns about the Trump administration’s fiscal policies. Protesters called for the protection of funding for health care, schools, universities, conservation work and the U.S. Postal Service.
Demonstrators began gathering at the courthouse plaza around 11 a.m. for two hours of speeches and music.
For many who were closer to the road than the amphitheater, it was hard to hear, so instead, they chanted and socialized. Law enforcement presence at the event was light. Some officers helped keep people out of the street while others were seen near an ambulance on Ninth Street.
 On the steps of the Missouri Capitol

 Victoria Harris, left, and Kurt Dulle wait for the “No Kings” protest to begin Saturday at the Missouri Capitol in Jefferson City. “I’m seeing the (Trump) administration is very easily, arguably, corrupted and doing things that are blatantly illegal,” Dulle said. ‘“I hope to see people say, ‘Enough is enough'” (Michael Baniewicz/Missourian).
The steps of the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City were packed with more than 1,000 protesters of all ages opposing deportation, restrictions to reproductive rights and federal funding cuts and layoffs.
The protest was organized by We Stand United Missouri, an organization that promotes political activism at the local level.
Speakers included Suzanne Luther, state House District 60 candidate; David Knipp, union and labor advocate; and Jordan Herrera, congressional candidate for Missouri’s 5th District.
Knipp, who goes by “Proud Union Guy,” said he was concerned about right-to-work laws and maintaining prevailing wage regulations.
“We’re the backbone of America,” Knipp told the crowd. “We don’t just build America — we are America.”
After hearing from speakers, protesters marched around the block, passing the Missouri Governor’s Mansion before returning to the Capitol building.
Their reasons for coming included a love of country, a desire to uphold checks and balances, and ensuring funds for state and federal programs.
Arianna Hensley-Parker, a 27-year-old mother who came with her kids, 6 and 3, said she was advocating for their futures, including continued access to health care.
She said her 3-year-old son received medical care and therapy from a program run by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for infants and toddlers with disabilities or developmental delays.
Hensley-Parker said the state-run program “was a huge reason why he can talk today.”
A couple from Lynn, Rob Overly and Kate Wilson-Overly, came to protest funding cuts to Medicaid and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Rob Overly’s mother was on Medicaid, he said, which helped pay for her colon cancer surgery. The procedure wouldn’t have elongated her life, but it did help her in her final days, he said.
“If it was not for Medicaid, that would not have happened,” said Overly, a member of the Osage County Democrats and a retired architect, “so I know how valuable that is.”
Everyone dies, Overly said, “but the question is how.”
Another couple traveled 2½ hours from Unionville to attend the rally. Steve, 64, and Jeanna Grimes, 63, said they were worried about funding cuts to Veterans Affairs programs, Social Security and international aid.
“We have 22 grandkids and three great-grandkids,” Steve Grimes said. “What is the country going to be like for them?”
His wife added that she thinks not just beyond her generation, but beyond U.S. borders, too.
“We really want good for the world. Why would they cut all the aid to other countries?” she said. “That’s soft power. That’s a beautiful thing.”
 On the square in Boonville

 Protesters march down Main Street holding signs and American flags during the “No Kings” protest Saturday in Boonville. The demonstration was part of a national day of action against authoritarianism and political repression (Xiaoman An/Missourian).
At least 100 protestors stood their ground outside the Cooper County Courthouse in Boonville, receiving honks and praise, as well as a few hostile signals from cars passing by on Main Street.
Boonville’s “No Kings” protest attracted people from the nearby communities of Moberly, Blackwater and Glasgow, but most were residents of the town.
Some said they had participated in historic movements before, including Mary Norbury, who held up a sign that read, “Jesus believed in DEI.”
“I think democratic ideals are just being shattered daily,” she said. “I believe in Christian principles, and that’s why I’m here.”
Norbury said she had joined a protest as a student at Duke University on behalf of Black workers who weren’t receiving compensation equal to their white counterparts.
After participating in a number of acts of civil disobedience, she said she believes everyone of any age should be able to voice an opinion, no matter how controversial.
“If they don’t, they have no right to complain about anything that happens,” she said. “You just have to be involved.”
Gaye Perera, former federal employee, helped organize Good Trouble Mid MO, an ad hoc committee in Boonville with more than 100 members. The organization’s mission is to “provide a voice for those concerned about the current direction of the country and how it impacts our community.”
“I do know that some members of our community, our Black neighbors and our LGBTQ neighbors, are more reluctant to come out, understandably, so it’s important that we represent them too,” Perera said.
Tamara and Lynn Lynch, a married couple from Boonville, said they were protesting to “make an impact.” Tamara Lynch is a former special education teacher, and Lynn Lynch is a special education compliance consultant at the University of Missouri.
“We believe the administration right now is continuing to break laws that are constitutional,” Lynn Lynch said. “There’s no reason to make cuts on the backs of people who are seniors, who are disabled, and our children, to give tax breaks to the wealthiest of this country.”
Tamara Lynch said her and her wife felt safe and protected, but she expressed concerns about the future of other protected rights under the Constitution.
“I’m worried that women’s right to vote could be compromised,” she said.
“We already lost the right to make decisions about our own body,” Lynn Lynch added.
 On a corner in Fayette

Between the Howard County Courthouse and the First Baptist Church on Saturday morning in Fayette, protesters stood in clusters, held “No Kings” banners and talked about their perception of a broken democracy.
There were no chants. There were no speeches. The crowd of about 40 aired their frustrations and grappled with the last six months of chaotic change in America’s political system.
The conversations addressed what the protesters saw as threats to the Constitution, cruelty toward others who may not have strong voices and a general “decay of democracy.”
“The way he’s treating our immigrants and being so cruel, it’s just not right,” said Peggy Robb, 71, who had turned out for her first protest.
“I’m a God-fearing woman, and I just can’t believe you could treat other human beings in that way,” she said.
She also spoke as a retired teacher, and said she opposes the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education.
Another protester, Beth Gold, said that in a small town, there is social pressure to respond to your neighbor in a friendly way. So, she said she was trying to spread her message through kindness while waving and smiling at cars passing by.
“I know everybody doesn’t agree with us, but if they can see us as people and not the enemy, that’s good,” Gold said. “We’ve made progress.”
Among a crowd that skewed older, John Tinker and his sister, Hope, were continuing a mission to promote change through protest that began nearly 60 years ago.
In 1968, John was a lead plaintiff in the landmark First Amendment Supreme Court case, Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, which established free speech as a protected right in America’s public schools.
He and another sister, Mary Beth, along with several others, wore black armbands to their public school to protest American involvement in the Vietnam War. After he was suspended, the Tinkers sued, and their case ended up before the Supreme Court.
The majority of Justices determined that students and teachers do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”
On Saturday, John and Hope Tinker held onto the promise that protest can make meaningful change when principles are involved.
“The main thing I think that needs to happen is for society to affirm to itself that it wants to be a democratic society,” he said. “That it wants to be represented in government. That it doesn’t want a government that goes off on its own and does stuff. It wants to be what the American promise was.”
“No kings!” his sister added, as the protesters began to head home in late morning.

The demonstrations were part of “No Kings” protests across the nation on Flag Day and before a military parade in Washington, D.C. over which Trump will preside on his 79th birthday.
In Louisville, crowds hoisting homemade signs gathered in front of city hall and marched through downtown as police blocked traffic. Andrew Schmidt, 46, who identified himself as an Army veteran and retired police officer from Vine Grove, wore his field uniform and carried a U.S. flag. He said he loves the flag and was holding it upside down to express his conviction that the country is in distress.
“It is your duty to honor your oath, and I feel like I’m doing that now as a retired officer and as a veteran,” Schmidt told the Lantern. “That oath is to the Constitution first and foremost, and it is also to defend the American public against enemies, foreign and domestic. Well, I feel we’re at the ‘domestic’ part right now.”

In Lexington, protesters spilled out of the Robert F. Stephens Courthouse Plaza onto sidewalks along Main and adjoining streets, chanting,“No kings. No crowns. We, the people, won’t back down.” Passing motorists joined in with a cacophony of car horns.
Dr. Craig Blair,  a Lexington veterinarian and leader of Peaceful Bluegrass Resistance, estimated the crowd in Lexington at 5,000.
Blair said his group has held 86 small roadside protests since February “to keep the news of the day in front of people” and participated in several larger protests. He said Saturday’s gathering was the largest and most diverse yet. “That’s been the big difference today because we’ve not had immigrant or minority participation in our previous rallies.”
Kim Edwards, a founder of the Lexington group Gathering for Democracy, agreed Saturday’s protest was the most diverse crowd yet, including more young people. Her group handed out information about actions to take as an “antidote to despair” and displayed a copy of the Declaration of Independence.
“It’s really exciting to see so many people who are interested in democracy and who are standing up and fighting for democracy,” Edwards said.

The national “No Kings” organizers, led by the 50501 Movement, say people across the country gathered at more than 1,500 demonstrations Saturday. In Kentucky, protests were planned in multiple towns, including Bowling Green, Owensboro, Frankfort, Hazard, Morehead, Richmond, Madisonville, Shelbyville, Paducah, and Ashland, according to the organizers’ national “No Kings” website.
 ‘A sense of community’
The protests coincided with a military parade in Washington D.C. taking place on the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary and Trump’s 79th birthday. The military parade, featuring thousands of soldiers and dozens of tanks and planes, is expected to cost the Army $25 million to $45 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Sophie Graf, a 50501 Movement organizer, said organizing groups estimated the turnout in Louisville at more than 5,000 people. Louisville police put the crowd at about 4,000.

Among them was Isabella Herrera, 25, who moved to Louisville from south Texas. She said she has friends at home who are afraid to go out during the day for fear of being targeted by immigration enforcement simply for appearing Hispanic. She said it was encouraging to see the large gathering opposing the Trump administration.
“It’s not only me that feels this way, it’s a shared feeling,” Herrera said. “It gives a sense of community.”
Denouncing the recent crackdown by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and advocating for law-abiding undocumented immigrants were common threads.
As a steady but brief rain fell, one of the first Lexington speakers, the Rev. Brian Chenowith, minister of the Unitarian Universalist Church, said “this is a time for truth, for denouncing authoritarianism.” Chenowith decried as “evil”  the Trump crackdown that he said is separating families and deporting without due process immigrants who have worked for decades in service and other jobs.
Chenowith ended his speech by pulling out a Mexican flag, saying, “I defy you, Donald Trump.” Chenowith explained Trump had labeled protesters displaying Mexico’s flag in Los Angeles as insurrectionists.
Afterwards, he told the Lantern “the president and his people were the ones who actually had an insurrection, brought swastikas and Confederate flags into our nation’s Capitol. It’s not an act of insurrection to be proud of your heritage, to be proud of your neighbors’ heritage from Mexico, Canada, the Caribbean or beyond. In Kentucky, we should celebrate Latino and Hispanic folks because a significant part of the industries that make Kentucky what it is rely on immigrants.”
JP Lyninger, a Louisville Metro Council member and Democratic Socialist, told the Louisville crowd that “facism is here and that we have to fight back.”
“We’ve got a political movement in control of the White House that goes after immigrants. We’ve got a political movement in the administration that’s going after union leaders, a political movement that’s against women’s rights and queer rights, a movement that wants to stop us from engaging in civil democracy and expressing our opinion,” Lyninger said.
 Teen’s detention sparks ‘outrage’ in Bowling Green
In Bowling Green, Tom Morris, an organizer with SOKY Indivisible, estimated at least 1,000 people, maybe as many as 2,000, turned out. The detention of a Kentucky teenager, Ernesto Manuel-Andres, by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had sparked community protests in the Warren County seat earlier in the week. 
“There’s a lot of outrage,” Morris said. “From what everyone understands, he was legally here and they had no right to take him. People feel like they were just trying to reach a quota. A lot of people know him; he had just graduated from high school. Adults say he’s a good kid. It really brought it home. It’s dawning on some people, hey, this isn’t far away, this isn’t LA, this is here.”

Louisville resident Kristen Lisanby, 34, told the Lantern the “No Kings” event in Louisville was her first protest. She said friends in Louisville have told her about people who have been “deported” from their workplaces. “We just want to make sure that we’re here, heard here hopefully,” Lisanby said.
Graf, a 50501 organizer, said the plan by the group is to keep demonstrating to show unity in opposition against actions by the Trump administration but to also pressure local officials to stand against “what the federal government is imposing on cities across the U.S.”
Elected officials at the Louisville protest included Democratic state senators David Yates and Karen Berg, both of Louisville, and U.S. Rep. Morgan McGravey of Louisville.
In Lexington, writer Silas House, a former state poet laureate, addressed the crowd.
Blair, one of the Lexington protest organizers, said, “the right tries to paint us as un-American. We wouldn’t be out here if we weren’t patriots. We’re fighting because we love the country.”
Blair said the founding fathers enacted the U.S. Constitution to prevent the rise of autocratic rule in the U.S. “It’s worked for 250 years. I’m not going to let Trump tell me he’s got a better idea.”

In Star Valley, two residents took an uncomfortable stand in their hometown. In Casper and Jackson, hundreds attended larger rallies.
The post ‘No Kings’ rallies come to rural, conservative Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","ALPINE—If history has taught anything, it’s that revolutionary thought often begins at the local watering hole. Paul Revere and the Sons of Liberty organized at Boston’s Green Dragon Tavern. The Founding Fathers frequented Philadelphia’s City Tavern. And on April 5, 2025, Sid Woods and Wayne Noffsinger hatched a plan at Jackson’s Snake River Brewpub.
The two old friends, both Star Valley residents for the better part of three or four decades, hadn’t seen much of each other in a long time. Both are self-proclaimed members of Lincoln County’s batch of “other” — queer folks living in a sparsely populated valley steeped in conservative politics and deep religious tradition. Those who don’t fit the mold tend to find one another.
Co-organizer Sid Woods demonstrates during a “No Kings” protest Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Alpine. “I certainly hold no gripes against people who aren’t coming, especially if their skin color’s a little darker. No gripes at all,” she said. “We have your back. We’re here.”
It seemed serendipitous then, that Noffsinger and Woods would again find one another this spring. He, a 57-year-old artist and medical assistant, had just attended his first protest on Jackson’s Town Square — one of more than 1,000 “Hands Off!” rallies taking issue with President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s cuts to federal programs and jobs. Woods, 62, a writer recently retired following a career with the U.S. Forest Service, has spent her entire life organizing and showing up — calling out everything from controversial nuclear energy projects in New England to the “usual indignities” affecting women and queer people across Wyoming in the wake of the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student, in Laramie.
The two have different recollections of whose idea it really was to organize their own “No Kings” Nationwide Day of Defiance rally in Alpine rather than make another trip up to Jackson. “I think we had been imbibed with beer,” Noffsinger ventured. 
Regardless, their work put the town of Alpine on the map as the smallest of 13 participating Wyoming towns and cities. Nationally, organizers said some 2,000 events drew millions of people to protest against the Trump administration.

Most demonstrations unfolded peacefully. But they occurred hours after another unsettling example of political violence: The shootings of two Democratic state lawmakers and their spouses in Minnesota, leaving two dead and two injured. Police there found “No Kings” flyers in the suspect’s car. Wyoming legislative leaders issued a statement Saturday afternoon calling for civility and mutual understanding as authorities continued to hunt for the suspected gunman. 
“May we come together in this moment of sorrow to reflect on the values that unite us and to work toward a future where such acts of political violence have no place in America,” the Wyoming lawmakers wrote.
Vying for survival
Wyoming was never on Noffsinger’s radar. Originally from Las Vegas, he moved to Los Angeles, where he attended community college and came out for the first time.
“I lived in Los Angeles and I lived in the ‘gay ghetto,’” he said. “I never felt the need to go beat my drum. I’m like, ‘Eh, I’m gay. Big fucking deal.’” 
Jen Slovak and Rob Dyke demonstrate during a “No Kings” protest Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Alpine, Wyoming. We RSVP’d to the Jackson one but then saw Alpine was having one, which is great,” Slovak said. “We wanted to stay local and support our community here. We’re so proud of our community.”
But after returning to Las Vegas and meeting someone, the 22-year-old packed his bags and followed his new Star Valley born-and-raised partner back home in 1990. The two lived and worked together in their home art gallery in Etna — the same place Noffsinger met Woods and her partner for the first time. 
“Back then, in my recollection, it was mostly queer communities that were being targeted,” Woods said. “After Matthew Shepard’s death, Wyoming felt particularly under the gun, kind of like with the wolf incident last year. When people feel particularly under the gun, they just sort of batten down the hatches and get worse.”
One night while at the gallery, the window of Woods’ truck was shot out.
“There was a long period where it was drive-by epithets. Our house was broken into, we had paintballs shot at the house,” Noffsinger said. “The day that they buried Matthew Shepard, they smashed our mailbox with a sledgehammer.”
His new home wasn’t Las Vegas, and he learned quickly that as a gay man in rural Wyoming, he certainly couldn’t maintain anonymity — or even expect apathy from neighbors the way he could in a place like Los Angeles.
He and his partner wrote a letter appealing to the community via the valley’s newspaper, the Star Valley Independent, and later went on the record with the Casper Star-Tribune, which published a front-page story about their experience being targeted as a gay couple in a socially conservative and deeply religious area.
“After you do that, it changes to where you become the activist in your own life, vying for your own survival,” Noffsinger said. “Especially in a very rural place like this where people don’t know you, so they make up stories about you. That’s one of the impetuses for me to be involved in this. They’re making up stories about immigrants that aren’t true.”

That’s what drove Karellina Kiljander, 22, to show up to a “No Kings” rally in one of Wyoming’s biggest cities, Casper. On Saturday morning, she held up a Mexican flag and wore a Mexico shirt to make a point as she and people she knows have been increasingly harassed as anti-immigration sentiment increases.
“It’s affecting my life. I have people in my life who are from the Hispanic community, and it’s bullshit,” she said. “They’re just here trying to live their lives, working hard and supporting their families. People just hate them, but they work so hard.” 
Others who feel the same were too scared to come out, she said.
“Just because of our skin color it doesn’t make us any different,” she said. “We work just as hard as anybody else.” 
Some 600 people showed up at Healing Park for the demonstration in Casper, according to Allyse Taylor, who organizes with the Casper Unity and Solidarity Project. The group has held numerous “Kick out the Clowns” protests in the park and were organizing another one before the “No Kings” wave took off. Other than a handful of critical comments from passing vehicles, and one person who briefly stopped his truck to angrily engage with some of the protesters, the event was otherwise uneventful and cheerful. Many of the protestors were planning to attend a PRIDE celebration at David Street Station later that day in downtown Casper. 
The Casper Unity and Solidarity Project, or CUSP, organized Casper’s rally to voice opposition to the Trump administration as part of the nationwide “No Kings” protests. CUSP’s Allyse Taylor has helped organize past protests in the city’s Healing Park. The June 14, 2025 showing was the largest, with an estimated 660 people participating, she said.

The Casper Pride event was lively and well attended. The Alpine protest, meanwhile, was an opportunity to offer up some visibility in a place where, according to Woods and Noffsinger, being the “other” is often punished. 
They wanted to make sure that people who are part of marginalized communities in Alpine and further up the valley — namely queer people, people of color and immigrants — could see that they didn’t necessarily need to drive an hour north and join the hundreds of people protesting Saturday in Jackson to feel safe and accepted in Wyoming.
“For me, it was what was being said about people that I knew. I have trans friends. I’m watching their rights being eroded,” Noffsinger said. “Nobody wants to be born to be the target of derision for the rest of their fucking life. Nobody chooses that.”
“I come from an ecological background where, hello, ecological diversity is understood as a positive. Why can’t social diversity be understood as a positive?” Woods said. “It’s not about the administration or the issues so much as the idea that, to me, we are a more diverse state than the false image of what this state is.”
A small-town rally
By 10 a.m. Saturday, more than 60 people joined Woods and Noffsinger along the bridge over the Snake River in Alpine. It’s a high-traffic choke point for commuters and tourists heading to Jackson, for locals towing boats out to the Palisades Reservoir — basically anyone moving in or out of the northern valley had to pass through Alpine’s “No Kings” gauntlet.
Demonstrators wave flags at approaching traffic during a “No Kings” protest Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Alpine. The rally drew more than 60 demonstrators in the small western Wyoming town 36 miles south of Jackson.
Pamela Thompson, of Alpine, was nervous to be there and had planned to drive to Jackson or some other nearby rally instead.
“The division and aggressiveness is frightening,” she said. “I feel like as long as I assimilate, everything’s going to be OK. But honestly I don’t even care anymore if I put myself out there because this is bonkers. We have to do something. 
“It just feels good to be with people who recognize this is wrong because you question your sanity sometimes. Does anyone pay attention, does anyone care?”
But supportive honks seemed to vastly outnumber vocal opposition throughout the morning. Plenty of middle fingers were thrown, chants of “Trump! Trump! Trump!” occasionally oscillated by at 35 miles per hour. One motorist yelled “All illegals must go!” as he passed. A couple times, a pickup would slow to a stop while rallygoers seemed to brace for potential trouble.
It’s not uncommon for residents of smaller towns to head to more populous places for political demonstrations. People from Pinedale and Driggs, Idaho, joined hundreds of demonstrators under the antler arches on Jackson’s Town Square.

Rebecca Bercher lives in Shell, population of less than 100. She attended the rally in Sheridan, a nearly two-hour drive northeast, to express her disagreement with how the Trump administration is handling the military. She served eight years in the Army, her husband retired after 23. They have two sons, who both are active duty military. 
“I’m upset about the communistic parade that’s going on that looks like something out of the Soviet Union today,” she said of Saturday’s massive military parade celebrating the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary, an expensive display intended to honor America’s military might. 
“And I do not like federalizing the National Guard above the wishes of a governor of a state,” Bercher added, referring to the federal deployment of National Guard troops to L.A. protests, despite opposition from state and local leaders there.

Bercher and her husband also depend on the Department of Veterans Affairs for their health care, she said, “I hate that they’re cutting it as well.”
Back in Alpine, as the clock hit noon and people began to filter out, Noffsinger and Woods walked along the highway making sure the area was cleaned up. Noffsinger’s nerves from earlier in the morning seemed to have faded after seeing dozens of his friends and neighbors who chose to stay and plant a flag in their own valley rather than drive to another larger city.

Woods was told by some they were disappointed in the turnout, as if they expected better of their hometown.
“We need to really reach out to one another right now, especially in our community so people don’t feel like they’re alone,” Noffsinger said. “That was what hit me up in Jackson, was that idea that there are people like us. It’s like you’re coming out again.”

Mike Cernovich, another right-wing influencer who has 1.4 million followers on X, took Rugg’s post and amped it up, but in the “just asking questions” style of many conspiracy theories:
“Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”
They were deeply ignorant about the MinnesotaCare issue.
Walz and Hortman — who was instrumental in passing legislation allowing undocumented people to sign up for MinnesotaCare as speaker of the House in 2023 — negotiated a compromise with Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature to end eligibility for adults, but keep it for children. They did so to win necessary Republican support in the 67-67 House to pass a state budget. Without it, state government would have shut down on July 1.
Both Hortman and Walz signed the compromise agreement in mid-May. This week, Hortman spoke tearfully about how difficult the vote was for her, but she was bound to vote yes on the issue because of the prior agreement.
Rugg and Cernovich’s posts were shared widely and just the start of the disinformation.
Once law enforcement sources began revealing a suspect, right-wing influencers ran with an insignificant detail: That Vance Luther Boelter was a “Walz appointee.”
Like many states, but even more so here, Minnesota is home to hundreds of nonpartisan and bipartisan boards and commissions, which are composed of thousands of people who typically win the appointment by simply volunteering. There are currently 342 open positions on Minnesota boards and commissions. Boelter was appointed to the Workforce Development Council by Walz’s predecessor Gov. Mark Dayton and reappointed by Walz.
It was the equivalent of calling a Sunday school volunteer an “appointee of the bishop.”
No matter, the Murdoch media machine, specifically the New York Post, had their headline: “Former appointee of Tim Walz sought….”
Cernovich had his greasy foil hot dog wrapper and began constructing a hat:
“The Vice President candidate for the Democrat party is directly connected to a domestic terrorist, that is confirmed, the only question is whether Tim Walz himself ordered the political hit against a rival who voted against Walz’s plan to give free healthcare to illegals.”
Walz had no such plan. He had signed an agreement to end eligibility for undocumented adults.
Joey Mannarino, who has more than 600,000 followers on X, was more crass:
“Rumor has it she was preparing to switch parties. The Democrats are VIOLENT SCUM.”
It was a ridiculous “rumor.” One of the last photos of Hortman alive was an image of her at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor’s big annual fundraising event, the Humphrey-Mondale dinner, which took place just hours before her assassination.
No matter, Cernovich wanted his new friends in federal law enforcement to act:
“The FBI must take Tim Walz into custody immediately.”
Finally, fresh off his humiliating defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump, world’s richest man Elon Musk quote-tweeted someone again falsely alleging Hortman was killed by “the left”  and added:
“The far left is murderously violent.” 
The suspect’s “hit list,” according to an official who has seen the list, comprised Minnesotans who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. CNN reported that it also included several abortion clinics, which doesn’t sound like the work of “the left.”
Right-wing influencers marred Hortman’s death and smeared Walz on a pile of lies.
In a different, saner world, they would be humiliated and slink away. But the smart money is that during the next moment of national crisis and mourning, they will again lie for profit.

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)Demonstrators joined a large “No Kings” protest against Trump administration policies in Grand Junction on Saturday as part of a nationwide movement of demonstrations.
Local organizers estimate that up to 3,000 people attended the protest in Grand Junction — a significant turnout for this predominantly Republican city that voted for President Donald Trump in 2024.
The crowd size peaked at around 10 a.m., when a rally began and before temperatures spiked, said Claire Ninde, of Indivisible Grand Junction, the group that organized the protest. Temperatures in the city were projected to reach triple digits on Saturday.

While 600 people registered for the event, the number of people who come to Indivisible events is typically four times the number who register, said organizer Mallory Martin.
The “No Kings” protest took place at Canyon View Park – in coordination with approximately 2,000 other protests across the county, on the same day as a Trump-planned military parade in Washington, D.C., to mark the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary. It also happens to be Trump’s 79th birthday.
Many Trump opponents claim the parade is about celebrating himself, and refer to it as his “birthday parade.” According to PBS, the parade will cost taxpayers between $25 million and $45 million.
Handful of counterprotesters
Grand Junction resident Caitlin Lyman said she came to the Grand Junction protest because she’s fed up with the Trump administration, and a little scared. She also wanted to be around like-minded people, she added. 
An Indivisible news release called the “No Kings” protest “a mass, nationwide protest rejecting authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.”
In Grand Junction, along the park’s west side, protesters lined up along 24 Road, stretching south to D Road, and north to the Interstate 70 overpass — where some people hung signs facing the eastbound interstate traffic. A handful of counter-protesters drove trucks back and forth. Some were flying Trump, Confederate, Israeli, and American flags.

Organizers encouraged people to watch webinars with instructions on how to deescalate tensions if they arise. A safety team urged protesters to not engage with counterprotesters. Volunteers also worked to keep people safe near traffic, as they left the park and began walking on the sidewalk along 24 Road. 
The local protest remained peaceful, although one counterprotester driving a white truck revved up his engine and veered slightly toward a group standing on the sidewalk. Others made obscene gestures and yelled at the protesters as they drove by. A truck driver emitted exhaust toward protesters. However, the vast majority of motorists signaled they supported the protest.
Lamar R. Edwards and Kevin Arensman, both of Grand Junction, chose to remain inside the park where they found a place in the shade to set up their chairs. Edwards said he was there to protest fascism. 
“I was just telling Kevin the young people don’t realize what fascism is like and what it’s done. In 1958 and 1959 I went to France and the destruction of that country was still there. The effort (the Nazis) went to destroy Europe is incomprehensible,” Edwards said.
Arensman wore a red T-shirt with the words “Jesus era un immigrante” (Jesus was an immigrant). As a white man in America, Arensman said it is his duty to protest Trump’s policies.

“Too many people are afraid to speak up with what’s going on in this country. Since I am able to speak up without fear, I will,” Arensman said. “My immigrant friends are in danger. One friend is supposed to go to his green card appointment in July but he doesn’t know if he’ll come home from that meeting.”
People are disappearing from those kinds of appointments, he added. 
Grand Junction resident Sabrina Roberts carried a sign that said “Honor the Flag.” She said she attended the rally because “I don’t like (the Trump administration) trying to suppress our First Amendment right. We need to be able to peaceably protest and not live in fear.”
Trump told reporters earlier in the week that “those people who want to protest” at the military parade are “going to be met with very big force.”
Standing near Roberts was Jennie Areson, whose sign said “Resist Fascism.” 
“I am totally anti-Trump,” she said. “I want democracy back, and to eliminate fascism. All my friends are here. We’re delighted to see this many people.”
Another protester, Renee Reynolds said “It’s so important to show up to defend democracy. You got to show up.”
Two young women, Jessiqa Montelbano and Lexi Shmalz, together held a sign that read “No! Kings! No! Dictator.”
“I wanted to show my support after hearing about it on TikTok and Instagram,” Montelbano said.

A trio of teenagers carried simple cardboard signs with messages that were important to them. 
“For me, I just couldn’t stand by and not join in,” said Karstyn Dayley, 19. “I feel strongly about Trump. He doesn’t put people’s needs in mind, except for the one percent. Every person counts.”
Her friend Kaysen Rodriquez, 17, said he came to protest Trump’s executive order aimed at ending citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens or legal residents.
As the protest wound down, Ninde praised her peacekeeping team for helping to keep everyone safe. She thanked law enforcement, too, for their presence.

Phil Murphy denounced political violence after a gunman shot two Minnesota state legislators (and their spouses) Saturday, killing one. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin ordered heightened security for public officials and increased patrols statewide Saturday after a gunman shot two state lawmakers and their spouses in Minnesota earlier in the day.
Gov. Phil Murphy said the bolstered security came “out of an abundance of caution,” and that there is no current, credible threat in New Jersey.
“The assassination of former Minnesota State House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark and the attempted assassination of State Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette have sent shockwaves throughout our nation,” Murphy said in a statement. “This terrible act against two dedicated public officials is an attack on our democracy. There is no place for political violence in the United States, and we must all work together to ensure our political differences are settled through debate, not bloodshed.”
Murphy recalled the 2020 attack at U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas’ home in New Jersey, when a gunman targeting the jurist murdered her 20-year-old son Daniel Anderyl and seriously wounded her husband Mark Anderyl. The incident prompted state legislators to pass a law, known as Daniel’s Law, that prohibits the public disclosure of the home addresses of judges, prosecutors, law enforcement officers, and other public officials.
“New Jersey is sadly all too familiar with targeted political violence against public officials and their families,” Murphy said. “We hope the perpetrator is quickly apprehended by law enforcement and swiftly brought to justice.”
The Minnesota shootings came during a day of political division nationally, with President Donald Trump’s supporters flocking to Washington, D.C., for a massive military parade to mark the Army’s anniversary and Trump’s birthday while thousands of demonstrators denounced Trump at “No Kings” protests around the country.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-14 22:53:48+00:00,Mississippi Today,Stay of death row inmate’s June execution to wait on judge’s response,Leonardo Bevilacqua and Lili Euzet,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/14/stay-of-death-row-inmates-june-execution-to-wait-on-judges-response/,Death row inmate Richard Jordan should find out Monday if a federal judge will halt his scheduled execution.,"U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate said he will decide Monday whether to delay Richard Jordan’s execution. The 79- year-old death row inmate’s defense argues that the set method of execution might constitute “cruel and unusual punishment.”
Jordan is scheduled to be executed on June 25 by injection of a sedative followed by two lethal drugs.
The sedative administered doesn’t prevent the inmate from feeling pain, Jordan’s defense argues. Prisoners can feel suffocation and cardiac arrest.
“Mr. Jordan and all the other people on death row were sentenced to death to have their lives extinguished,” said Jim Craig, Jordan’s attorney at a hearing Saturday  for a preliminary injunction to halt the execution. “They were not sentenced to be tortured before they die.”
Jordan and fellow death row inmate Ricky Chase are lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the drugs used for lethal injection. 
Jordan, at 79 the state’s oldest and longest serving death row inmate, was first convicted in 1976 for kidnapping and killing Edwina Marter in Harrison County. He had four trials until a death sentence stuck in 1998. 
Mississippi Department of Corrections protocol requires execution staff to ensure that inmates are completely unconscious before proceeding with the lethal drugs. The “proposed consciousness check” is a mandated wait time of three minutes between administering the sedative and the lethal drugs.
But the latest two executions in Mississippi – David Neal Cox on Nov. 17, 2021, and Thomas Loden Jr.  on Dec. 14, 2022 – did not follow this protocol: execution staff only waited one to two minutes before injecting the other drugs. Citing a deposition from Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain, the Attorney General’s Office ensured Judge Wingate that protocol would be followed with Jordan.
Execution staff would also rub Jordan’s sternum and monitor his reaction to pressure applied. Wingate asked the Attorney General’s Office how many seconds the test would last, but they could not provide a set answer.
If the sedative fails, no protocol is in place. At that point, the decision to proceed with the execution lies in Cain’s hands.
Wingate floated an idea that Cain would no longer make this call if the sedative fails. In 2022, a state law gave the commissioner sole discretion to decide the method of execution of incarcerated people.
He set a deadline of Monday noon for an answer from Cain.
The U.S. Supreme Court distributed Jordan’s petition for a writ of certiorari at a May 29 conference and is expected to discuss it again at a June 18 conference – a week before the execution.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07041116/judge-Henry-Wingate-e1514409305395.jpg,,,2025-06-14 19:01:34.912065

Melissa Hartman talks to colleagues during a special legislative session Monday, June 9, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Hortman’s husband was also shot and killed, the governor said.
Walz, appearing emotional at a press conference in the north metro, said they were killed in an apparent “politically motivated assassination.”
“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
On Saturday afternoon, authorities asked for the public’s assistance in locating Vance Luther Boelter, the suspect connected with the shootings. They said he was last seen Saturday morning in Minneapolis wearing a dark long-sleeved shirt and a cowboy hat.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list. According to an official who has seen the list, the targets included prominent pro-choice individuals in Minnesota, including many Democratic lawmakers who have been outspoken about their policy positions.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
According to a source close to Walz, the governor spoke to Vice President J.D. Vance about the targeted attacks in Minnesota. The governor thanked the vice president for the coordination between federal law enforcement and Minnesota public safety officials.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

Roger Marshall. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Fifth-generation Kansan Christy Davis announced Saturday she is exploring a run against incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, who she said is spending his time flattering the “tyrant in the White House” instead of standing up for Kansans.
Davis, a Democrat, made the announcement to the hundreds of people gathered for the No Kings rally at the state Capitol. She served as White House appointee for U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development during the Biden administration and previously lost in the Democratic primary in 2020 when she ran for the U.S. House in the 1st District against Kali Barnett. Republican Tracey Mann won that seat.
Davis and her family live in Cottonwood Falls.
“Unfortunately, the rights Kansans have fought for are being threatened by a tyrant and a Congress that is scared to hold him to account,” Davis said. “This isn’t the America that is the land of the free and the home of the brave. Nothing about this is our values. We didn’t vote for this. We need to stand together, regardless of political parties, and remember who we are — not just Americans, but we’re Kansans, and we deserve better.”
Davis criticized Marshall for failing to protect Kansas and its economy.
“The administration is clawing back funding for our public schools and dismantling the entire farm economy,” she said. “And what is Senator Marshall doing in response? He doesn’t even live here. Not what the Constitution says he’s supposed to. Instead of representing us and checking the power of the tyrant in the White House, he’s trying to flatter him.”
Davis’ words drew chants of “vote him out” from the crowd, which was gathered to protest the Trump administration.
On Saturday, Newsmax posted an interview with Marshall honoring the 250th birthday of the Army. He also sent birthday wishes to Trump.
“It’s been just the honor of a lifetime to work beside him to make America great again,” Marshall said.
In 2016, Marshall, who is a obstetrician and gynecologist, entered politics with a run against incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Tim Huelskamp, defeating him in the primary and later winning the 1st District seat.  In 2019, he announced he would run for the seat that U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts was vacating. He won the primary and eventually the seat, beating out Democrat Barbara Bollier.
Devon Welcher, of Topeka, also revealed her intent to run for office, telling the crowd she plans to run for governor as an independent candidate.
In an interview, Welcher said she is running because “Kansas is in trouble,” and that voters should know, “I’m the real deal.”

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Thousands of people gathered on the grounds of the Washington state Capitol in Olympia on Saturday for the “No Kings” protest, part of a nationwide day of defiance against President Donald Trump. 
Around the country, similar demonstrations unfolded throughout the day and had been planned in more than 2,000 locations nationwide. The protests coincided with Trump’s birthday and a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C. 
In Olympia, crowds remained peaceful, and the Department of Enterprise Services, which manages the Capitol grounds, said attendance peaked at around 5,000 people.
“When we say no kings, we are rejecting systems that hold power and erase our existence,” said Natalie Coblentz, a speaker at the rally, adding that the gathering was meant to demonstrate protesters’ refusal to be ruled by kings, tyrants, or systemic oppression. 
The protests began at 9:45 a.m. near the Capitol Mall, west of downtown Olympia. There, a crowd of around a couple dozen people began marching toward the Capitol, with people joining along the way. When demonstrators arrived at the Capitol around 11 a.m., the crowd size had grown to around 2,000.
A band played music near the campus’ Tivoli Fountain as people lined Capitol Way, holding up signs as cars honked in support. People also spread out to the steps of the Legislative Building and the Temple of Justice, where the state Supreme Court convenes. 
Attendees could be seen dancing to music, blowing bubbles, and sitting in the sun. Olympia Indivisible, the group organizing the rally, emphasized that participants should remain nonviolent. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson and other elected officials urged people to demonstrate peacefully at a press conference yesterday. 
Those warnings followed Trump’s decision to deploy about 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement that began there late last week.
The band marched to the Capitol steps around noon and speakers took the stage shortly thereafter. They criticized how Trump has handled a range of issues, including immigration, veterans’ affairs and transgender rights. 
“This regime is sowing fear and division to chill our dissent and silence our opposition as they systematically attack the pillars of democracy,” said Lisa Ornstein, Olympia Indivisible co-founder, in a speech. 
Throughout the day, people shouted chants like “no kings, no tyrants” or “land of the free because of the brave.” 
At the top of the steps, a large sign spelling out the word “resist” was held up, each letter was decorated differently with the trans, Ukrainian, and Palestinian flags, among other designs. 
Speeches ended around 2 p.m. and the crowd began to disperse shortly after. Most participants had left the campus by 3 p.m. Counter protesters did not appear to be in attendance.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3557-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-14 19:01:34.912065

Mike Cernovich, another right-wing influencer who has 1.4 million followers on X, took Rugg’s post and amped it up, but in the “just asking questions” style of many conspiracy theories:
“Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”
They were deeply ignorant about the MinnesotaCare issue.
Walz and Hortman — who was instrumental in passing legislation allowing undocumented people to sign up for MinnesotaCare as speaker of the House in 2023 — negotiated a compromise with Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature to end eligibility for adults, but keep it for children. They did so to win necessary Republican support in the 67-67 House to pass a state budget. Without it, state government would have shut down on July 1.
Both Hortman and Walz signed the compromise agreement in mid-May. This week, Hortman spoke tearfully about how difficult the vote was for her, but she was bound to vote yes on the issue because of the prior agreement.
Rugg and Cernovich’s posts were shared widely and just the start of the disinformation.
Once law enforcement sources began revealing a suspect, right-wing influencers ran with an insignificant detail: That Vance Luther Boelter was a “Walz appointee.”
Like many states, but even more so here, Minnesota is home to hundreds of nonpartisan and bipartisan boards and commissions, which are composed of thousands of people who typically win the appointment by simply volunteering. There are currently 342 open positions on Minnesota boards and commissions. Boelter was appointed to the Workforce Development Council by Walz’s predecessor Gov. Mark Dayton and reappointed by Walz.
It was the equivalent of calling a Sunday school volunteer an “appointee of the bishop.”
No matter, the Murdoch media machine, specifically the New York Post, had their headline: “Former appointee of Tim Walz sought….”
Cernovich had his greasy foil hot dog wrapper and began constructing a hat:
“The Vice President candidate for the Democrat party is directly connected to a domestic terrorist, that is confirmed, the only question is whether Tim Walz himself ordered the political hit against a rival who voted against Walz’s plan to give free healthcare to illegals.”
Walz had no such plan. He had signed an agreement to end eligibility for undocumented adults.
Joey Mannarino, who has more than 600,000 followers on X, was more crass:
“Rumor has it she was preparing to switch parties. The Democrats are VIOLENT SCUM.”
It was a ridiculous “rumor.” One of the last photos of Hortman alive was an image of her at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor’s big annual fundraising event, the Humphrey-Mondale dinner, which took place just hours before her assassination.
No matter, Cernovich wanted his new friends in federal law enforcement to act:
“The FBI must take Tim Walz into custody immediately.”
Finally, fresh off his humiliating defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump, world’s richest man Elon Musk quote-tweeted someone again falsely alleging Hortman was killed by “the left”  and added:
“The far left is murderously violent.” 
The suspect’s “hit list,” according to an official who has seen the list, comprised Minnesotans who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. CNN reported that it also included several abortion clinics, which doesn’t sound like the work of “the left.”
Right-wing influencers marred Hortman’s death and smeared Walz on a pile of lies.
In a different, saner world, they would be humiliated and slink away. But the smart money is that during the next moment of national crisis and mourning, they will again lie for profit.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Several thousand people marched across the Broadway Bridge between Little Rock and North Little Rock on Saturday morning in one of 15 protests statewide as part of a national show of dissent against President Donald Trump’s administration.
Many protest signs displayed the name of the event — “No Kings” — while others criticized specific Trump policies and actions since he began his second term in January, including cuts to the federal workforce, health insurance for low-income people and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. American flags were a common theme — on signs, as capes, taped to umbrellas.
“Our democracy is at risk in every form and fashion that I can think of,” said April Hickman, who attended the protest with her daughter, Jayna. “[A journalist] straight up asked Trump, ‘Do you have to follow the Constitution?’ And he said he didn’t know, and that’s in the oath of office.”
Several cars honked at the marchers on the bridge, formally known as the Veterans Memorial Bridge, drawing cheers from the crowd. 
 Organizers led a series of chants, including “Dump Trump” and “This is what democracy looks like.”

Courtney Maxwell, a protest co-organizer and former Democratic candidate for the Faulkner County Quorum Court, said she expected a maximum of 1,000 protesters and was pleasantly surprised to see more. Unofficial estimates of the turnout ranged from 2,000 to 8,000.
The turnout means Arkansans are “ready for change” and “waking up” in the face of injustice, Maxwell said.
Vietnam War veteran Pat Slaughter said he had never attended a protest before Saturday but felt motivated by the “total abomination” of the Trump administration.
“We fought to stop this type of behavior,” Slaughter said. “…I love my country and I want my country to be safe, and it’s not safe with Felon 47 in the White House.”

Others said they have engaged in past protests, such as one Kylie Woodward attended in 2023 against a bill in the state Legislature that would have restricted drag performances similarly to pornography or strip clubs.
Woodward said Saturday’s turnout was impressive, particularly the number of older adults present.
“They’re fighting against what their generation is ultimately putting onto America,” Woodward said.
One family from Camden made the hour-and-a-half trek to Little Rock as first-time protesters, and said it wouldn’t be their last protest because “we’re not going to survive with [Trump],” Mary Frey said.
“A lot of our friends couldn’t even come because they were Black, they were Chinese, Asian.” Frey said. “So we have come for them.”

 ‘Breaking point’

Little Rock and Fayetteville protest organizers told the Advocate that the two cities’ police departments were aware of their plans for nonviolent organizing. The protest in Little Rock stayed peaceful.
The Democratic Party of Arkansas shared via Facebook photos and videos of several other No Kings demonstrations throughout the state, including Texarkana, Jonesboro, West Memphis, Hot Springs and Harrison.
Other protests were planned for Bentonville, Fort Smith, Monticello, Paragould, Benton/Bryant, Russellville, Eureka Springs and Mountain Home. Protesters in Mountain Home said on Facebook that there were about 300 of them compared to a handful of pro-Trump counterprotesters.
Saturday’s nationwide protest effort coincided with recent tensions in Los Angeles over the arrests of immigrants the Trump administration has claimed are in the country illegally. Ensuing protests have seen occasional violence. 
While many of the Little Rock protesters said it wasn’t their first demonstration, others said the gravity of the current times compelled them to show up. One said he hadn’t protested in years due to his responsibilities as a father, but came to today’s protest with his young family in tow because he felt like “democracy is really on the line.”

At least 2,000 people showed up to the Little Rock 'No Kings Day' protest on Saturday, one of at least 1,500 protests taking place across the U.S. in response to Trump administration actions. Hear and see what Advocate reporters witnessed on the ground as protesters crossed Veterans Memorial Bridge.

Nancy Retas of Little Rock was draped in a Mexican flag and holding two American flags while holding a sign that read: “Practice what you preach: Love thy neighbor.” Retas said that “no one is illegal on stolen land,” adding that her mother “has zero felonies, and Trump has 34.”
Retas, a first-time protester, grinned and laughed when asked about the size of the crowd. 
“I was scared that there would be like a hundred people, but I’m so happy that Arkansas is a part of change and hopefully we continue in that.”
One protester’s sign said “Reduce the federal workforce? Fire ICE,” referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Other signs said, “You can’t spell hatred without red hat,” referring to Trump’s supporters, and “regnat populus,” Arkansas’ state motto, which is Latin for “the people rule.”
Another first-time protester, military veteran Mark Magie, said that his prior service compelled him to attend.
“I believe in the Constitution, and I don’t like what’s happening,” he said. “Some church members where I go to church have come to previous ones and talked about it, and you sort of just reach a breaking point, like I’ve got to do something. And if I can add my voice to the people’s voice, then I think that’s important.”
 ‘Commit to making a difference’

Leaders of Arkansas and Pulaski County Democrats handed out voter registration forms to the marchers and encouraged people to register to vote. Arkansas has consistently had lower voter turnout than most other states.
Grant Tennille, chairman of the Democratic Party of Arkansas, was among those trying to get people registered. He said the day was about sending a message that “we don’t have kings in the United States of America.”
“The crowd is encouraging and incredible,” Tennille said. “I truly believe that one of the most important points of protest is that there are people out here in Arkansas who feel like the people in this crowd; who might be too afraid to stand up. And when they see a crowd of people like this, maybe that helps they to say, ‘Okay, if all those people can do it, I can do it too.’”
Marcus Jones, who ran as a Democrat for Republican U.S. Rep. French Hill’s seat in Congress last year, said the “barrage of confusion that’s coming out of  Washington” is “probably the best reason to stay involved” in political activism.
Jones told rallygoers who convened at Margaret Clark Park on the Little Rock riverfront after the march that he hoped they would take their “righteous anger” and “turn it into action.”
“You’ve got to commit to making a difference in your community,” Jones said. “You’ve got to commit to looking out for your neighbor. You’ve got to commit that you will vote, you will run for office, you will stand up and have your voice heard.”
Andrew Cade Eberly, former state House candidate and current vice chair of the Pulaski County Democratic Party, said the protest taught him and other Democrats what motivates community action.
“We’ve realized we don’t need to have meetings where people show up and get talked at,” Eberly said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Here are some photos to give a better idea of crowd size in Little Rock. Protesters stuck to the pedestrian walkway on one side. The group was much longer than the bridge, taking the better part of an hour for full group to walk across. Likely a few thousand people at peak. @arkansasadvocate.com

Trump’s 79th birthday.
Nearly 30 rallies had been officially planned through the “No Kings” organization page in Montana, including in its largest cities as well as other smaller towns, including Hot Springs (population 617) and Eureka (population 1,533). Facebook postings showed nearly 600 people in Livingston, and an estimated 400 in Lewistown.
In Montana’s largest city, Billings, organizers estimated a crowd in excess of 2,000 people, more than had rallied for democracy just months earlier. During the two-hour event, the crowd centered on the Yellowstone County Courthouse lawn, adjacent from the federal courthouse. Crowds holding signs gathered for several downtown blocks as horns blared in solidarity and in protest.
Speakers and singers rallied the crowd, as signs, flags and even pets wearing outfits created a colorful protest on issues ranging from immigration to taxes to groceries. One sign read: “You wanted cheap eggs, you got measles.”
“We are the richest country on earth at the richest point in the nation’s history,” said Bob Struckman of the AFL-CIO. “Then why are we so broke? It’s not the trans community. It’s not the immigrants. It’s the billionaires. But we know that working people are the ones that solve the problems. We build roads, we teach kids. That’s called diversity, brothers and sisters, and when we get together at the ballot boxes, that’s called democracy.”
Struckman said he was rallying for good jobs, rebuilding the middle class, and staying unified.
Many around the state flocked to the rally, including over 3,000 people in Bozeman, and even close to 200 in Havre.

The scene was in Helena was upbeat, as more than 2,000 attendees spread out over the lawn of the state’s capitol. A Ska band performed before and after speeches. Speakers included former Republican Governor Marc Racicot, who has been outspoken about Trump. Racicot was the former head of the Republican National Party.
“It is as predictable as night following day that Donald Trump will ignore and transgress the ethical and legal boundaries of the law and the Constitution at his whim and caprice,” Racicot said to a roaring crowd. “There is virtually no ethical obligation or moral code that guides or confines his actions, his snide accusations, his sociopathic lies or his brutish behavior. Vengeance and extortion are his weapons of choice to enforce his demands and his only boundaries are the limit of what he wants.”
Racicot’s 10-minute speech was blistering and well received by the crowd. He spoke about Trump’s disregard for laws, expressing his utter distaste the president’s attacks on the judicial system, social security nets and how the President’s actions have disrupted the entire world’s economy.
“We the people, quite frankly, have waited too long in the face of overwhelming evidence to draw and act upon numerous inescapable conclusions, to stand up, stand up and speak out,” Racicot said.
Attacks on the education system, as well as Trump’s stated goal of dismantling the federal Department of Education were mentioned throughout the day. Charlie Snellman, a recent graduate of Capital High School, spoke about his frustration with what his education could end up looking like.
He also spoke about attacks on the arts, including Trump taking over as chairman of the Kennedy Center.
“His goal is to install a golden age for American arts that doesn’t sound golden, it sounds controlled, it sounds stifled, but it sounds like a warning,” Snellman said to the crowd. “This is our call to action, because let’s not forget, after becoming German chancellor in 1933, Hitler and his Ministry of Education sought to control education and the arts in every possible way, Nazi ideology was infused into every aspect of social and private life in Germany. So I ask you, what’s different about our president?”

































































































































































































































Luke Ashmore, who was recently elected as a trustee of the Billings Public Schools, said he wasn’t there representing a political campaign.
“I came for the most important job I have, as a neighbor,” Ashmore said. “Day-to-day action starts right now, building on micro-actions. Make sure you’re talking to your neighbors, and you’re having face-to-face conversations.”
Jennifer Lynn, a native of Wibaux who teaches history and politics at Montana State University-Billings, is an expert on 20th Century Germany.
“There are dangerous and real parallels between now and 20th Century Germany,” she said, including dehumanizing immigrants, women and targeting the LGBTQ+ community. “The lessons that I try to teach all of my students is: Beware of the beginnings. Donald Trump has told us who he is and what he wants. This is not inevitable — we can fight, resist and defend our Constitution.”
Pastor Lisa Harmon, who has been a leader in Billings for decades, and works at the First Congregational church in the heart of the downtown, across from the courthouse, said that for her, the moment felt like the biblical story of the Pentecost.
“When people from different backgrounds and different languages felt a wind sweeping over them and a message in their own native language, in that moment, it didn’t flatten their identity, it lifted them up; it lifted each voice. It was about a king, it was promoting peace and justice and today, it feels like that kind of day,” she said. “There is power in and among the people. People are diverse in story and body.
“A complex and complicated people were building something more beautiful and more free. It reminds us that no law and no border can undo our belonging to each other. Liberty is your birthright, and we have something more powerful than a throne — we have each other.”
 



  Protesting the protestors 

Though most of the protestors and rally-goers at the “No Kings” events were there to oppose the military parade in Washington, D.C., and object to President Donald J. Trump, intermingled in the sea of signs were a few people holding “Make America Great Again” signs, and other placards expressing support for the policies of the Republicans.
Pat Curry stood across the street from most of the protesters, wearing his Trump t-shirt, and buttons, including one Trump that had a shock of beige-orange hair.

He admitted he was outnumbered, just like the last time, but showed up, he said, to rally for common-sense and to support the president.
Curry said he’s been pleased with how the second Trump presidency has handled issues, including stopping transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports, as well as keeping bathrooms separate.
“I’m 6-foot, six and 250 pounds. Can you imagine me playing sports with women?” he asked.
He said that he’s also proud that Trump is standing up for freedom, including not being required to get a vaccine.
“The government shouldn’t tell me that I have to get a shot in order to keep a job that I have had for 20 years,” Curry said.
He also said that he’s happy to see the Trump administration return to common sense when it comes to sex.
“People don’t know if they’re a man or a woman, and they’re all focused on sex,” he said. “But then when they do have sex, they want to kill at the babies.”
Nearby, Lucinda Splitstone stood holding a sign supporting Immigration and Customs and “backing the blue.”
“If we don’t speak up for our rights, who will?” she said. “And no one is standing up for them.”
In one minor incident in Helena, a Trump supporter sounded a large horn in a parking lot reserved for legislators during the event. He eventually left after speaking with law enforcement, though the horn could be heard several times down the street.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1327-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-14 19:01:34.912065

Mike Cernovich, another right-wing influencer who has 1.4 million followers on X, took Rugg’s post and amped it up, but in the “just asking questions” style of many conspiracy theories: 
“Did Tim Walz have her executed to send a message?”
They were deeply ignorant about the MinnesotaCare issue. 
Walz and Hortman — who was instrumental in passing legislation allowing undocumented people to sign up for MinnesotaCare as speaker of the House in 2023 — negotiated a compromise with Republicans in the Minnesota Legislature to end eligibility for adults, but keep it for children. They did so to win necessary Republican support in the 67-67 House to pass a state budget. Without it, state government would have shut down on July 1. 
Both Hortman and Walz signed the compromise agreement in mid-May. This week, Hortman spoke tearfully about how difficult the vote was for her, but she was bound to vote yes on the issue because of the prior agreement. 
Rugg and Cernovich’s posts were shared widely and just the start of the disinformation.
Once law enforcement sources began revealing a suspect, right-wing influencers ran with an insignificant detail: That Vance Luther Boelter was a “Walz appointee.” 
Like many states, but even more so here, Minnesota is home to hundreds of nonpartisan and bipartisan boards and commissions, which are composed of thousands of people who typically win the appointment by simply volunteering. There are currently 342 open positions on Minnesota boards and commissions. Boelter was appointed to the Workforce Development Council by Walz’s predecessor Gov. Mark Dayton and reappointed by Walz. 
It was the equivalent of calling a Sunday school volunteer an “appointee of the bishop.” 
No matter, the Murdoch media machine, specifically the New York Post, had their headline: “Former appointee of Tim Walz sought….” 
Cernovich had his greasy foil hot dog wrapper and began constructing a hat: 
“The Vice President candidate for the Democrat party is directly connected to a domestic terrorist, that is confirmed, the only question is whether Tim Walz himself ordered the political hit against a rival who voted against Walz’s plan to give free healthcare to illegals.”
Walz had no such plan. He had signed an agreement to end eligibility for undocumented adults. 
Joey Mannarino, who has more than 600,000 followers on X, was more crass: 
“Rumor has it she was preparing to switch parties. The Democrats are VIOLENT SCUM.”
It was a ridiculous “rumor.” One of the last photos of Hortman alive was an image of her at the Democratic-Farmer-Labor’s big annual fundraising event, the Humphrey-Mondale dinner, which took place just hours before her assassination. 
No matter, Cernovich wanted his new friends in federal law enforcement to act:  
“The FBI must take Tim Walz into custody immediately.”
Finally, fresh off his humiliating defeat at the hands of President Donald Trump, world’s richest man Elon Musk quote-tweeted someone again falsely alleging Hortman was killed by “the left”  and added: 
“The far left is murderously violent.” 
The suspect’s “hit list,” according to an official who has seen the list, comprised Minnesotans who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. CNN reported that it also included several abortion clinics, which doesn’t sound like the work of “the left.” 
Right-wing influencers marred Hortman’s death and smeared Walz on a pile of lies.

The coast-to-coast “No Kings” protests on Saturday, held on a day celebrating the official adoption of the American flag by the Second Continental Congress, coincided with President Donald Trump’s birthday and a major military parade on the streets of Washington, D.C., to honor the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.

In addition to the rally in South Carolina’s Capital City, thousands attended similar events across the Palmetto State, including Greenville in the Upstate, Charleston and Summerville in the Lowcountry and the Charlotte suburb of Rock Hill, area media outlets reported.
The protests went on with no reports of violence or acts of destruction despite earlier concerns and a warning issued ahead of the events by S.C. Attorney General Alan Wilson.

Protesters in Columbia filled the lawn and lined the street from corner to corner in front of the Statehouse as afternoon temperatures climbed to nearly 90 degrees. They waived American flags and hoisted signs with slogans on a host of issues, including deportation of immigrants, cuts to Medicaid, threats to civil liberties and democracy and attacks on the LGBTQ+ community.
For Tessa Gonzalez, her 8-year-old daughter, Ana Sofia, and concerns over potential cuts to Medicaid were her motivation for attending the demonstration.
The young girl has a rare genetic mutation, known as CASK, and requires a specialized wheelchair and nutritional formula.
“My daughter, 100% depends on Medicaid to provide the medicine, equipment, everything that she needs to lead a happy, healthy life,” said Gonzalez, a pediatrician from Elgin. “So it’s essential.”
With her wheelchair and other equipment, Ana Sofia is able to go to school and attend events in the community. She particularly enjoys swimming and splashing in the water, Gonzalez said. And she loves music. Her favorite song is “APT” by Bruno Mars.
The Gonzalez family carries private insurance to help cover Ana Sofia’s cost of care. But Medicaid covers things private insurance does not, like the $20,000 wheelchair she needs and which has to be upgraded every few years.

Brown said his deepest concerns are transgender rights and immigration. “I think it’s important for us to have a loud voice and be visible because there are so many who can’t speak for themselves,” he said. (Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)
“She would just have to be in the house and never out, never doing anything,” Gonzalez said. “She has a sister and a family who absolutely loves her. I don’t know what we’d do without her.”
Events like the protest on Saturday lets the family know they’re not alone in their concerns, Gonzalez said.
“There are so many of us who are feeling similarly,” she said. “But we have to make our voices heard, whether that’s calling our representatives, coming out to rallies. We can’t just sit by and let all of this happen. We have to take action.”
Kevin Brown, of Columbia, attended the protest Saturday in support of the transgender community.
The 41-year-old business owner said he has friends who are transgender.
“These are people I know and I’m scared for them,” he said. “I think it’s important for us to have a loud voice and be visible because there are so many who can’t speak for themselves.”
A trio of friends from Lexington, Jake Yanity, Sean McCall and Sebastian Albert, said they were angered by the estimated $25 million to $45 million military place taking place at the same time in Washington, D.C. They felt the money would be better spent on improving K-12 education or funding national park operations.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Thousands of North Dakotans in 10 cities joined the national No Kings protest movement Saturday, with organizers saying they saw new faces joining the effort to oppose Donald Trump’s policies.
Kathy Bullinger of Bismarck showed up at the state Capitol grounds with her two sons, including one who has disabilities. She said she worries her son’s care could be affected if proposed Medicaid cuts are implemented. 
Bullinger, a longtime teacher, also is concerned about the elimination of the Department of Education. An organizer estimated the Bismarck crowd to be about 1,700.
“People are nervous and they’re tired,” she said. “They are here today because of that and I’m one of them.”

Organizers estimated about 3,000 gathered at City Hall in Fargo, while smaller protests were held in Grand Forks, Jamestown, Bottineau, Devils Lake, Dickinson, Williston and Minot. A No Kings group also walked in the Valley City Community Days parade on Saturday. 
The movement served as counter-programming to Trump’s military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, which commemorated the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army and also fell on Trump’s 79th birthday. 
In Devils Lake, organizer Julie Schuler said about 80 people joined the protest, double the turnout of two recent local rallies.
“What was so exciting was that there were so many new faces,” said Schuler, who is involved with a recently formed local group known as Voters for Democracy.
Participants gathered outside the Lake Region Heritage Museum and took turns with a microphone sharing stories about why they joined the rally.
“I was so impressed with the stories that were shared, whether it was from a farming situation or whether it was just from pure fear out of what’s going on with our administration,” Schuler said.
In Jamestown, about 180 people met at the top of Mill Hill where they had a moment of prayer before marching with signs and singing “America the Beautiful” and other songs, said organizer Lily Cizadlo.
“I’ve watched the numbers grow in every turnout, so that’s been very exciting,” Cizadlo said.

At the Bismarck event, Cheryll Rush, 79, of Hazen said she was embarrassed to reveal her age because she is the same age that Trump turned on Saturday. Rush said she protested in the 1960s and 1970s and she believes the country is moving backward.
“We’ve become a police state with his ICE,” Rush said. “It’s un-American.”
Rush said Hazen and Bismarck are Republican-leaning towns, but she was reinvigorated by the large crowd of demonstrators pushing back. 
Dyllon Faul of Bismarck attended Bismarck’s Capitol Pride festival Saturday and also stood with the protesters along the roadway.
“With how our commander-in-chief is behaving, we need somebody that is in political office that is going to represent the people in an ethical, moral way, and I don’t see that happening,” Faul said.

At Fargo’s event, which also drew participants from neighboring Minnesota, Jacob Pruneda of Fargo was wrapped in a Mexican flag. 
“We didn’t vote for this,” he said. “The Constitution protects rights for all.”
Lyn Dockter-Pinnick, an organizer for Indivisible Fargo-Moorhead, said the increase in activism recently is noticeable.
“There’s just so many issues and the more people become aware of the fact that this is going to impact me, the more people want to get involved,” she said. “Action is truly the antidote for despair.”
No major incidents were immediately reported at the North Dakota rallies. 
In Bismarck, a handful of counter-protesters assembled on the opposite side of the street as the No Kings demonstrators.

Charles Tuttle, a conservative who was attending the North Dakota Republican Party reorganization meeting across the street from the protest, waved a large American flag with Trump’s face screen printed over the stars and stripes.
“We should always stand up for what we believe in,” Tuttle said. “We should all be able to be out here without being antagonistic to each other.”
A vehicle with Pennsylvania plates sped at least four times past the Bismarck event with a passenger making obscene gestures and screaming a racial slur at the crowd. In Fargo, a truck blared its horn for part of the event in an attempt to drown out the speaker. In Devils Lake, a motorcyclist yelled at the protest group, but participants responded by chanting “USA.”
Elijah Robinson, a Chicagoan spending his summer in North Dakota for an internship, also joined the Fargo rally. He said as Black person, there is a tradition of standing up for one’s rights, though he said it was his first protest. 
“I’m glad they had it. I’m glad it remained peaceful,” Robinson said.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)NEW ORLEANS – Costumes, brass bands and even makeshift floats followed a twisting parade route Saturday in one of hundreds of “No Kings” protests across the country, meant to coincide and counter events in Washington, D.C., for President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday and the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.
Thousands assembled in sweltering heat at a vacant lot in the historic Marigny neighborhood, adjacent to the French Quarter. The city block-sized property slowly emptied as organizers led the crowd down residential streets, with police blocking traffic at intersections along the way to a culminating rally in Washington Square Park. Tourists and locals along Frenchmen Street, including passengers on a mule-drawn carriage, unknowingly became part of the procession.
“No kings! No Trump!” a man shouted from his balcony, drawing cheers from the crowd below.  
More than 30 minutes after speeches began at the rally, elements of the parade were still arriving to the park. Pro LGBTQ+ marchers and their signs were prominent among the anti-Trump displays, with the annual Nola Pride Fest also bringing them to the city for the weekend.   
At the rally, Margaret Woodward, with the group Citizens for the Constitution, held a small copy of the nation’s founding document as she addressed the growing crowd. 
“The president is holding his big ugly display tonight because he is afraid of this, afraid of the constraints that it puts on his power,” Woodward said, gesturing toward her U.S. Constitution booklet. “And he wants to make a military show that frightens you into forgetting about his limitations.”
“Are you gonna forget?” she asked the crowd, prompting a resounding “no” in response.

New Orleans flavor permeated its No Kings event, with Scott and Janet Howard among the many participants who donned costumes for the occasion. Both are well known in New Orleans business and civic circles; he’s a retired bank executive, and she’s the former leader of a local good-government watchdog group. 
The Howards wore cardboard tanks, reminiscent of those set to roll through the nation’s capital later in the day.
“We’re actually able to produce tanks for the government at $68 a piece,” Janet Howard said, crediting her husband’s costume craftsmanship.
Two men in the parade had crafted a small, U-shaped countertop, which they called the Tiny D Diner, towed by a bicycle they took turns riding. They invited paraders to “Smash ICE,” pulling out cubes for them to hammer on the counter’s surface.    
Like most parades in the city – and with no small amount of irony – No Kings had a queen: songwriter-musician Dusky Waters (the stage name for Jenn Jeffers), who told the rally crowd about how her grandmother and aunt desegregated all-white schools in Arkansas. She sang “We Shall Overcome” as the tail end of the parade was just arriving at the square.
Other No Kings gatherings in Louisiana took place in Alexandria, Baton Rouge, Covington, Lafayette, Lake Charles, Leesville, Monroe, Ruston and Shreveport.
Friday night, before the No Kings events and the D.C. celebration took place, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a pro-Trump Republican, posted on social media that she would take a hard line against any protests she determined to cross the line. She referenced ongoing demonstrations in Los Angeles, where the president has wrested control of the California National Guard to quell opposition to federal immigration enforcement.     
“The First Amendment guarantees the right to peacefully assemble and petition the government – it does NOT protect anarchy, vandalism, or rioting,” Murrill wrote. “This isn’t California. I’ll defend constitutionally-protected activity, but I’ll prosecute criminal actions.”
Casting a pall over the No Kings protests and pro-Trump ceremonies were the early morning shooting deaths of a leading Democratic state lawmaker and her husband in Minnesota. State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed at their home, and Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, who live minutes away, were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening, the Minnesota Reformer reports. 
Gov. Tim Walz has called Hortman’s murder a “politically motivated assassination. Authorities have said a 57-year-old man impersonating a police officer is suspected in both shootings.
Murrill and Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry have condemned the killings on social media.

Trump vowed on social media it would occur “rain or shine,” given weather forecasts calling for showers.According to the Army, 6,700 soldiers were expected to march. Crowds could also expect to see 150 tactical vehicles and weapons systems. Together the parade and festival cost between $25 million and $45 million, according to the Army.But tragedy and deep conflict marked the hours and days leading to the event. Early Saturday, a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband were assassinated in their home in an “act of political violence,” said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, while another legislator and his wife were shot and gravely wounded.Late Friday, dozens of veterans breached barricades around the U.S. Capitol in protest of the Army parade. On Thursday, a Democratic U.S. senator from California was handcuffed and forcibly removed from a press conference with the head of Homeland Security.Last weekend, multi-day protests erupted in Los Angeles after immigration raids swept across several Home Depots, typically where undocumented day laborers search for work, as Trump’s mass deportations continue to be carried out.And the president is in a legal standoff with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, after Trump ordered more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to be sent to LA without Newsom’s consent and Newsom sued. A federal appeals court froze a lower court’s order directing Trump to return command of the Guard troops to Newsom.‘Yeah, I wanna be there’In Washington, spectators from across the country began lining barriers along the Army parade route hours before the event's start.Scott Aiken, 59, of Athens, Georgia, drove 10 hours for the parade. Aiken, who told States Newsroom he voted for Trump in the last three presidential elections, said he wanted to support the anniversary of the Army.

“My father was in the Army, and my wife's father was in the Army, and we're a supportive military family. And when I heard the parade was going to happen, I thought, ‘Yeah, I wanna be there.’ So we drove up from Athens on Thursday, and did the Capitol tour yesterday, and here we are.”When asked about the timing of Trump's birthday, Aiken said “whether it's on his birthday or not, I don't care. That's not the purpose of this.”Members of Trump’s Cabinet and other allies on social media posted well wishes and greetings. “Wishing a very happy birthday to our incredible President Donald J. Trump!” Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem posted on X. Trump said on his social media site, Truth Social, “President Putin called this morning to very nicely wish me a Happy Birthday, but to more importantly, talk about Iran,” referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and a recent attack by Israel on Iran’s military leaders.Not everyone at the parade was wishing Trump well. Angelica Zetino, 24, and Shoshauna Brooks, 27, from Rockville and Gaithersburg, Maryland, stood out among the crowd as they carried signs protesting Trump's administration, particularly recent immigration raids.The pair began their morning at a “No Kings” protest in Rockville before heading to D.C.“They (the administration) just want to put on a show, which is OK, but we're here to support the people that can't have a voice for themselves,” Brooks said.Rallies opposing TrumpThroughout Saturday, protests unfolded across the U.S. bearing the theme “No Kings” to decry Trump’s military display on his own birthday and the mass immigration arrests.The “No Kings” national organizers said in a press release that as of 2 p.m. Eastern, protesters had rallied at more than 1,500 sites across the country, with 600 more events scheduled through the rest of the day. “No Kings” was organized by liberal groups and labor unions including Indivisible, the American Federation of Teachers, American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen, MoveOn, 50501, Interfaith Alliance, Stand Up America, Common Defense, Human Rights Campaign and League of Conservation Voters.Approximately 60 protesters were arrested outside the U.S. Capitol Friday evening, according to the U.S. Capitol Police. Veterans for Peace, a group that organized the demonstration, posted photos of the arrests and of several demonstrators wearing “Veterans Against Fascists” t-shirts.Police said 75 people peacefully demonstrated outside of the U.S. Supreme Court.“A short time later, approximately 60 people from the group left the Supreme Court so as a precaution, our officers began establishing a perimeter,” a police spokesperson told States Newsroom in an email. “A few people pushed the bike rack down and illegally crossed the police line while running towards the Rotunda Steps. Our officers immediately blocked the group and began making arrests.”Among those arrested was an elderly Vietnam veteran using a walker, Capitol Police confirmed.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on June 10 that any protests at the military parade “will be met with very heavy force.”Two mules and a dogA trickle of red “Make America Great Again” hats and apparel displaying support for the Army intermingled as supporters shuffled into the parade grounds Saturday afternoon.The parade featured soldiers from every division, 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, 34 horses, two mules and one dog, at a price tag in the tens of millions of dollars, according to the Army.Among the vehicles and equipment that are expected to roll down Constitution Avenue between 15th and 23rd streets NW were Abrams tanks, first used in 1991 for Operation Desert Storm; High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, used to launch multiple rockets at precise aim from far distances; and 9,500-pound titanium M777 lightweight Howitzers that fire 105-pound shells up to 24 miles and are currently in use on Ukraine’s battlefields.

Military aircraft that are expected to be seen above Washington in ceremonial flyovers, from AH-64 Apaches, UH-60 Blackhawks and CH-47 Chinooks. Army Golden Knights were set to parachute down to the White House South Lawn to present Trump with a folded flag.D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed concern in the weeks leading up to the parade about the heavy tactical vehicles causing damage to the city’s streets. The Army Corps of Engineers had installed large steel plates ahead of the event to reinforce the roads.The parade coincided with the Army’s 250th birthday celebration festival, which has been in the works for a year.The parade appears to have been a late addition to the festivities. According to documentation obtained by local D.C. news outlet WTOP, America250 applied on March 31 for a permit for the parade. A May 21 press release about the parade from America250, which describes itself as a “nonprofit supporting organization to the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission,” celebrated Trump’s role in the event.Trump wanted a military parade during his first term, but the idea was dismissed because of cost, NBC reported at the time.The last time the U.S. staged a celebratory military parade was in 1991 under former President George H.W. Bush to recognize the victory in the first Gulf War.Immigration enforcement and military The big Army celebration early in Trump’s second term came as the president has intertwined the U.S. military with his immigration policy, as shown in LA and elsewhere.In his first days in office, Trump signed five executive orders that laid out the use of military forces within the U.S. borders and extended other executive powers to speed up the president’s immigration crackdown.He’s directed the Department of Defense to use a naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to detain migrants. Military planes have been used in deportations – rather than standard commercial airplanes.In April, he signed a proclamation creating a military buffer zone that stretches across Arizona, California and New Mexico just north of the U.S.-Mexico border. It means any migrant crossing into the United States would be trespassing on a military base, therefore allowing active-duty troops to hold them until U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive.National and military experts have raised concerns that giving control over the Roosevelt Reservation to the military could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that generally prohibits the military from being used in domestic law enforcement. A statutory exception in the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, is the Insurrection Act of 1807.Trump has considered invoking the Insurrection Act, but has stopped short. The Insurrection Act is an existing presidential authority that would grant the president access to use all federal military forces, more than 1 million members.The Insurrection Act has only been invoked 30 times, and is typically focused on an area of great civil unrest that has overwhelmed law enforcement.The last time a president used it was 1992, during the Los Angeles riots, after four white police officers were acquitted in the brutal beating of Black motorist Rodney King.In calling in the National Guard in LA last week, Trump cited a rarely used statute known as the protective power –  10 U.S.C. 12406 – to use National Guard troops to protect federal personnel and property, but not for broad law enforcement functions.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-06-14 18:01:27.590312

Among the speakers at the rally was Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), who expressed her support for the Detroit community in resisting the current federal administration.
“When I look at all of you, you don’t have to have a ZIP code in Detroit to understand that fascism hurts all of us. Many of you have your stance in why you’re here,” Tlaib told the crowd “Maybe immigrant rights. Maybe Free Free Palestine. Maybe LGBTQ. Maybe it’s fighting to make sure workers are protected. Maybe saying you will not dismantle education in our country. Whatever issue, the more we are connected, the more dangerous we become to this administration.”

Tlaib emphasized support for immigrant families affected by federal border agents, not only in Michigan but also across the country. She also commented on how tax dollars are contributing to the war in Gaza.
“That’s why you all are doing what you’re doing and resisting. In the streets and demanding that our families stick together, demanding that our rights be protected, demanding that our country come back for the people, by the people. It’s when you all resist.” Tlaib said.
As speakers addressed the attendees, some counter protesters approached, sparking minor clashes involving shoving and insults, which volunteer protesters helped disperse. Detroit Police arrived minutes later, but no arrests were reported. However, individual pro-Trump counter protesters kept walking through the crowd.

The Detroit gathering was one of dozens held across Michigan and more than 1,500 nationally. Other Michigan cities hosting protests included Flint, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Ferndale, and even as far away as Ironwood in the western Upper Peninsula.
In Lansing, several thousand people turned out for a protest in front of the Michigan State Capitol, as protestors held anti-Trump signs and waved American flags. The crowd later marched down Michigan Avenue to Cedar Street and then turned around and returned to the Capitol, where a No Kings carnival was being held.
Small Michigan communities also saw well attended protests, including in Republican-heavy Livingston County.
Approximately 300 protestors gathered in front of Howell City Hall where they were mostly cheered on by passing motorists. One of the protestors, Roni Evans of Howell, told the Michigan Advance she felt compelled to be there.

“It makes me sad. I protested a lot when I was younger and did rallies and campaigns, but I’m feeling so frustrated with what’s going on in this country that I had to come out,” Evans said.
At one point, a large pickup truck stopped on Grand River in front of the protest where the driver began revving its engine. However, a Howell Police officer quickly told him to move on.

The protestors later marched through downtown Howell and were cheered on as they passed by the Historic Courthouse, where a Pride rally was being held by the Pride Alliance of Livingston.
Meanwhile, just down I-96 in Brighton, several thousand demonstrators packed into the city’s Mill Pond area to hear from several speakers, including Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel.

“At the end of the day, there is right and wrong. There is moral and immorality. At the end of all of our lives, the one question we’ll be asked is ‘What did we do in this moment?’ These rallies are important, but they have to lead to action,” Hertel told the crowd to loud cheers.

Melissa Hortman talks to colleagues during a special legislative session Monday, June 9, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Hortman’s husband was also shot and killed, the governor said.
Walz, appearing emotional at a press conference in the north metro, said they were killed in an apparent “politically motivated assassination.”
“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
On Saturday afternoon, authorities asked for the public’s assistance in locating Vance Luther Boelter, the suspect connected with the shootings. They said he was last seen Saturday morning in Minneapolis wearing a dark long-sleeved shirt and a cowboy hat.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list. According to an official who has seen the list, the targets included prominent pro-choice individuals in Minnesota, including many Democratic lawmakers who have been outspoken about their policy positions.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
According to a source close to Walz, the governor spoke to Vice President J.D. Vance about the targeted attacks in Minnesota. The governor thanked the vice president for the coordination between federal law enforcement and Minnesota public safety officials.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

The crowd covered the Capitol steps, filled the section of Jefferson Street in front of the building and stretched deep and wide throughout nearby Cecil D. Andrus Park as people chanted “No more kings” and “Love, not hate, makes Idaho great.”
Tammie Baker was one of thousands who attended the protest. She carried a homemade sign that read “I prefer my ICE crushed” and said her concern over the Trump administration’s policies motivated her to attend her first political protest since the 1970s.
“There is only one reason,” Baker said. “ Enough is enough of everything. This is out of control.”
“There is not much one person can do, but you have to start somewhere,” Baker added.
The “No Kings Day” protest in Boise was one of hundreds of similar protests that took place across the country Saturday. 
Separate “No Kings Day” rallies were planned for Saturday in other Idaho communities as well, including Nampa, Pocatello, Moscow, McCall, Driggs, Coeur d’Alene, Twin Falls and Idaho Falls. 
The “No Kings Day” protests coincided with President Donald Trump’s birthday and a military parade celebrating the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday held in Washington, D.C.
Additionally, a patriotic demonstration voicing support for Trump was also planned for the Idaho Falls area on Saturday, East Idaho News reported.

 Idaho 50501 group helped organize Saturday’s anti-Trump protest

The activist group Idaho 50501 organized Saturday’s “No Kings Day” rally in Boise, saying it sought to peacefully demonstrate against the glorification of individual power over collective liberty. The event included live music and several speeches from local organizers.
“This is about more than one man. It’s about standing against the idea that power belongs to the few,” local organizer Chris Ross said in a written statement before the protest. “We are gathering to defend democracy, dignity and the right to dissent. Remember: when you think for yourself, you are dangerous to tyrants.”

The group is part of the wider 50501 movement, which got its name for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement.
Gretchen Bingea of Garden City attended Saturday’s “No King Day” protest in Boise because she was concerned about ICE raids, the federal budget reconciliation bill, a rise in authoritarianism and the policies enacted by Trump.
Bingea, who said she has been to several similar rallies and protests, carried a sign that read “If there’s money for a parade then there’s money for Medicaid!”
When a reporter with the Idaho Capital Sun asked Bingea if she had a message for any policymakers listening, she said, “Do your job, they are not standing up to Trump.”
Although she is frustrated with Trump and many other elected officials, Bingea said she was heartened by the size of the crowd that filled the grounds surrounding the Idaho State Capitol on Saturday.
“It’s encouraging that people are paying attention; people know how serious this is,” Bingea said. “Power belongs to the people.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Thousands of people flocked to Nashville’s Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park for a “No Kings” protest Saturday despite gloomy skies, clutching signs decrying Donald Trump and his administration, denouncing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and advocating for due process.
The crowd quickly exceeded the capacity of the park’s amphitheater in view of the Tennessee State Capitol and spilled out over much of the park’s grass field. Ultimately, swaths of protesters young and old lined the sidewalks of Rosa L. Parks Boulevard and Jefferson Street near the park, chanting to drivers honking their horns as they drove by.
Chants of “This is what democracy looks like” and “USA, no Trump, no KKK, no racists” filled the park as people carrying signs and American flags made their way toward the streets.
The protest was organized by Indivisible Nashville, a group that supports progressive policies and resists what it calls “the Trump agenda” under the umbrella of Indivisible Tennessee. 
The event was one of thousands planned across the country as part of the “No Kings Day of Defiance,” scheduled to roughly coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C. marking the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary. The controversial military parade also falls on Flag Day and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday. In Tennessee, a total of 24 cities planned to participate.
The Nashville demonstration was peaceful, with some attendees playing music and dancing in the park. Volunteers wearing neon vests directed protesters to stay out of the streets and handed out water bottles to combat the humid weather.
A handful of counter-protesters, some wearing holsters, walked among the demonstrators with their own signs. One man yelled, “Donald Trump is y’all’s president too,” as he walked against the flow of the crowd. Another man near him held a sign that read, “Kamala LOST, Trump WON, JESUS is KING.”
Metro Nashville police arrested one masked counter-protester carrying a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag after people reported that he pulled what appeared to be a handgun out of its holster. 
State leaders spoke of love, hope, determination
Tennessee state Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, was among the speakers who kicked off the event. He nodded to the Army’s 250th anniversary and Flag Day.
“Flag Day is not a day for ceremonial gift wrapping for the President’s birthday. It’s not something that you put on a politician’s lapel while they vote to take away healthcare to give billionaires tax cuts … It’s not just about celebrating the flag; it’s about figuring out what it means, what it stands for,” Yarbro said. 
“And this group, we’re here today for the flag that 250 years ago fought against tyranny, took on and took down slavery, for the flag that liberated Europe from Nazis, for the flag that for generations, has been used to demand that we live up to our highest ideals and not our basest, lowest instinct,” he said.
Luis Mata, a former Democratic candidate who unsuccessfully ran for a Tennessee House of Representatives seat representing Smyrna, spoke as part of the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition, recalling his childhood growing up without legal immigration status in Tennessee before he became a U.S. citizen.
  “We’re here today for the flag that 250 years ago fought against tyranny, took on and took down slavery, for the flag that liberated Europe from Nazis,” said Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat.
“This meant living in a different kind of reality, a reality where our entire being was used to fuel an unpopular anti-immigrant agenda trickling from the White House to our state legislature, and right now, immigrants are being used as pawns in a broader attack on our democracy, with those in power putting themselves above the law, erasing due process, disappearing our neighbors, and silencing anybody who dares to speak up,” Mata said.
He told a cheering crowd in the amphitheater that “social movements are born out of pain, but they are sustained through love.”
“Right now it is dark, and right now it is scary, but one thing that they forget is that we are the recipients of generations of organizers who refused to lose hope … who showed us that the strongest movements are fueled by the hopes of everyday working-class people, the courage to resist and the … unwavering commitment to a long-term vision that demands us showing up each and every day, organizing each and every day, election cycle after election cycle, legislative session after legislative session,” Mata said.
Before protesters made their way to the sidewalks lining the streets, a representative from Indivisible Nashville delivered a call to action: “Call your senators and tell them to kill this big bogus bill, and denounce ICE,” a reference to Immigration and Naturalization Enforcement. The budget reconciliation bill was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives but remains under Senate consideration.
On the outskirts of the park an hour later, Cathy Corley and Heather Argo stood together on a grassy hill overlooking the park and the state capitol building. 
Corley, wearing an “I stand with Ukraine” T-shirt and a glittery Uncle Sam-style hat, said seeing what is happening in the country is painful. 
“It is wonderful to be with like-minded people, and see that there is hope,” she said of Saturday’s protest.
Argo came from Franklin to join Corley at Bicentennial Park, though she questions if protests truly lead to change.  While people continue protesting, she said, President Donald Trump “keeps keeping on.”
“What can we honestly do to make a change?” Argo asked. “I don’t think anybody has an answer for that.”
She said people can vote in a year and a half at midterm elections, but noted how much could happen in that timespan. 
“It scares me,” Argo said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The attacks on two prominent Minnesota state lawmakers and their spouses, leaving two wounded and two dead in a “politically motivated assassination,” sent shockwaves across the country, including in Utah.
House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who the Minnesota Reformer called one of the state’s most influential elected officials of the past decade, was shot and killed alongside her husband in their home overnight Saturday by a man impersonating a police officer. 
An emotional Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the deaths a “politically motivated assassination,” mourning Hortman as a “formidable public servant” and a dear friend.
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their home. Walz said that following surgery, there is cautious optimism they will recover.
Minnesota House Democratic leader dead after ‘politically motivated assassination’

In Utah, Democratic legislative leaders said they are “heartbroken and outraged by the targeted political violence” against Hortman, Hoffman and their families.
“As leaders, we had the opportunity to work with Representative Melissa Hortman. Representative Hortman was a strong voice for equity, environmental justice, and the most vulnerable in her state. She was a fierce advocate for reproductive rights and for all Minnesotans. Her loss is immeasurable,” Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla and House Minority Leader Angela Romero, both Salt Lake Democrats, said in a joint statement Saturday.
Escamilla and Romero offered their condolences to the Minnesota lawmakers’ families, loved ones and legislative colleagues, and denounced political violence and hate.
“No one, elected or not, should ever fear for their safety when expressing their beliefs or serving their communities. We urge leaders at every level to recognize the tragedy of this moment and commit to deflating divisive and harmful rhetoric in our communities,” Escamilla and Romero’s statement said.
An additional statement from the Utah Senate Democratic Caucus echoed that message, while honoring the work that Hortman and Hoffman did in office.
“These legislators fiercely advocated for their constituents with a strong and courageous voice for equity, equality and accurate representation,” their statement said.
In a post on X, Utah Republican Gov. Spencer Cox called the shooting “a heartbreaking reminder of what happens when we allow hatred to replace our shared humanity.”
“In a free society, disagreement is inevitable. Violence is not. We must recommit to the virtues that hold us together—and to the conviction that every person, regardless of politics, deserves our respect,” Cox wrote. 
The message from Utah Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, was similar, saying: “This is a profoundly sad day, not just for Minnesota but for our entire nation. This senseless act of violence is unacceptable. We may not always agree, but violence is never the answer. My prayers are with the families, friends and colleagues affected by this horrific event.”

This demonstration is one of about 1,800 worldwide and one of 35 across the state of Iowa. 
The protest was held in response to Trump’s birthday celebration, which is expected to cost around $25 million to $45 million, according to the U.S. Army spokesperson Heather J. Hagan and the administration’s military response protesters in Los Angeles.
“He’s spending all this money on one day and Iowans are literally starving, losing their health care and dying. And it’s ridiculous,” said Sue Dinsdale, executive director of Iowa Citizen Action Network.

She was joined by disability rights activist Julie Russell Stewart, Iowa Federation of Labor President Charlie Wishman, Ivette Muhammad with Creative Visions, Keenan Crow from One Iowa and Rep. Rob Johnson of Des Moines.
“This my friends, this is power,” Wishman said. “Power doesn’t lie in the government, power lies in you.”
The event began with a statement of community guidelines, where organizers expressed an emphasis on peaceful protest and deescalation. The opening statements were followed by a rendition of “America the Beautiful” by two-time Iowa Blues Challenge winner Tina Findley.
“The rule of law is important to me and our president is trying to push that beyond the acceptable limits and we should be protesting,” said Alison Lemke, a retired speech pathologist from Newton.
Lemke and her husband, John Easley, drove into the Capitol to express their support of the protest. Easley said those who gathered could number anywhere between 5,000 and 10,000.
 The couple was at the first No Kings protest, which Easley said hosted around 3,000 protesters, but “was much smaller.” Dinsdale says around 2,000 signed up but “they just keep coming and coming.”
“No matter who you look like or who you love, everyone has a place here today,” Dinsdale said. “It doesn’t have to happen to you for it to matter to you.”

The event coincided with a military parade in Washington, D.C., ostensibly for the Army’s 250th anniversary, but also for President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday, and in the aftermath of a week that featured military deployment by Trump to Los Angeles immigration protests.
In Santa Fe, crowds swelled as the temperatures rose at the state Capitol, where protesters began the day with multiple speakers and performers. State police estimated — when asked by Source NM — approximately 1,200 attendees in the area, but an accurate head count was hard to come by, as crowds also circled the Capitol, with some protesters marching to the Plaza and back.
As of early afternoon, police said no incidents had been reported, other than a few people “collapsing” from the heat. Fire fighters in the area with medical personnel would not confirm to Source that anyone had collapsed, but said a few medical situations — none emergency-level — had occurred.

Hot or not, attendees held signs embracing the “No Kings” theme of the day, while also holding ones protesting attacks on immigrants; the war in Gaza; and assaults on gay and trans lives, among numerous other issues.
New Mexico’s Raging Grannies provided song sheets once again for a reworking of “We Shall Not Be Moved,” which included the lyrics:
“Racist deportations, Nazi policies
hunting down the people, acting lawlessly
We will be free! We say no to tyranny!
We shall not be moved.”
One of the event organizers, Julie Zimber, who said she works with Santa Fe’s Indivisible groups and is “in touch” with the national 50501 organization behind the national protests, said her main “mission is to do outreach to create a progressive umbrella that really pulls in all of our community partners…and that we learn to build a coalition and trust each other and work together. We need to come together under one very large umbrella that’s about fighting fascism and…believing that all people all over the world need to be treated with dignity and respect.”
E.J. Martinez Elementary teacher Jennifer Lopez carried a sign that read, “I’m here for my students who are living in fear.”
“It’s not only about immigration,” she told Source. “It’s also trans students; students who have gay parents. It’s all women. We’ve had families who are worried about bringing their kids to school when this all started. We’ll see what it’s like when the school year starts again. I’ve had kids who have had a lot of anxiety about the rights for trans kids being taken away.”
What does she tell them?
“We just have to have hope and to fight,” she said.
Albuquerque teacher Doug Mattson’s sign, “It’s officially fascism,” which he displayed prominently from the sidewalk on the Paseo de Peralta side of the Roundhouse ,appeared to be pulling the largest number of honks (in an unscientific assessment). He showed up to the event, he said out of the “need to do something. Right now, there’s no check on Trump’s power, so the people need to do something. Congress has been very weak, so we need to be out here.”
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.), who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District, which includes Santa Fe, rallied the crowd with a speech that emphasized the protest theme: No Kings.
“The last time that this country had a king was 250 years ago,” Leger Fernández said. “And what did we do with that King? We got rid of him. And how did we get rid of him? We got rid of him by organizing, by mobilizing, by talking to our neighbors, because we must always talk to our neighbors and explain why…why we must do what we do, because we know that a government of the people, by the people, for the people, is the best way to prosperity for all the people.”
In comments to Source NM following her speech, Leger Fernández acknowledged the prior week had been a “rough” one for Democratic members of Congress, with events including the indictment of U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey after her May confrontation with officials at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center; the forcible removal and handcuffing of California U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla at a news conference for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem; and the U.S. House approval of a bill that would revoke billions in funding for PBS, NPR and foreign aid programs.
“But then, when you come to a realm like this, when you see the number of people showing up, we are re-energized in our commitment to fight for this democracy,” she said. As I said earlier: We are bound to each other. We belong to each other in this common purpose of securing a diplomacy that gives prosperity to all Americans. That’s what we’re all fighting for. The people here… have shown up. They’ve shown up in the snow, they’ve shown up in the sun. They will keep showing up until we kick those…MAGA Republicans out of office, because it’s both the power of the people and the power of the ballot box.”
‘Hands off everything we love’

In Albuquerque, cars slowed to a crawl for miles on Montaño Road as people streamed in and out of Mariposa Basin Park Saturday for its march, some carrying inverted American flags, and many adorned with paper Burger King crowns. Thousands of people fanned out between the trees and spread across the grass, telling Source NM they were there to protest the Trump administration’s deployment of troops to L.A., the military parade, federal cuts and deportations without due process.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, who represents the 1st Congressional District, addressed the crowd:
“Imagine if our elected GOP officials had even an ounce of bravery that any single one of you in this field today have — we would not be on the precipice of losing everything,” she said. “We will fight, we will march and we will save our democracy,” she concluded, to cheers and applause.

The protests happened on Trump’s 79th birthday – the same day a military parade was planned in Washington to mark the Army’s 250th anniversary.
The protest outside the Mississippi Capitol was largely peaceful. Capitol Police officers quickly stopped two small confrontations. Hundreds of demonstrators carried signs with slogans including “Make racism wrong again” and “Felon 47 is not a king despite SCOTUS.”
Counter-protesters at the Capitol carried signs proclaiming they oppose abortion and support Jesus.
As some of the protests were happening in the state, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves posted a happy birthday wish to Trump, adding: “Make America Great Again!”
In Gulfport, Lea Campbell of the Mississippi Rising Coalition said the protests are a way “to say no to fascism in our streets and to demand dignity, safety, liberty and justice for all,” according to The Sun Herald. Campbell said people of color, the LGBTQ community, poor people, unhoused people and workers “are not our enemy.”
“I know that fascism and white nationalism are the enemy of our democracy,” Campbell said.
Protesters gather at the State Capitol in Jackson for the No Kings event June 14, 2025.
The Sun Herald also reported a few Trump supporters stood across the street from the rally. One of them, retired Seabee Robert Charles Hall Sr., held a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag and said he was carrying a pistol. He said he brought the gun in case police needed help and would use it to defend anyone in the crowd if the protest turned violent.
In Oxford, slogans on signs included: “This is the government our founders warned us about,” “Democracy dies when we stay silent” and “Hate never made any nation great.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/14152555/No-Kings-protest-1.jpg,,,2025-06-14 17:00:53.297429

Mike Kehoe announced on May 27 that he will call a special legislative session to consider disaster relief, stadium funding and spending items (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).A $1.5 billion stadium funding plan aimed at convincing the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals to stay in Missouri was signed into law Saturday afternoon by Gov. Mike Kehoe shortly before his trip to France on a trade mission.
Kehoe signed two other bills on Saturday: one providing $125 million in aid for communities hit by severe weather and another spending around $200 million on various construction projects across the state.
The bills were the product of a two week special legislative session called by Kehoe last month designed, primarily, to counter an offer by Kansas to fund up to 70% of the construction costs for new stadiums for the Chiefs and Royals if they moved across the state line. That deal expires at the end of the month.
Missouri’s counter offer would allocate state taxes collected from economic activity at Arrowhead and Kauffman to bond payments for renovations at Arrowhead and a new stadium for the Royals in Jackson or Clay counties.
The cost is estimated at close to $1.5 billion over 30 years.
Both teams have expressed interest in leaving Missouri when the lease on their current stadiums expire in 2030.
“We called legislators back to Jefferson City because the stakes were too high to wait,” Kehoe said in an emailed statement announcing he signed the stadium funding deal.
The disaster relief provisions in the legislation address both the devastation of the May 16 tornado in St. Louis and the damages suffered by other Missourians in storms and flooding earlier in the year. The aid was required due to uncertainty about the federal response to the tornado.
Kehoe asked President Donald Trump for a federal disaster declaration for the tornado on May 25 and for April 29 storms in Scott on May 19. The president didn’t officially declare a disaster, opening the door for federal aid, until June 10.
The governor was expected to quickly sign the bills, which passed earlier this week, because he will be in Paris on Monday for his first international trade mission. During Kehoe’s absence, Lt. Gov. David Wasinger will serve as acting governor.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052725_kehoe3-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-06-14 17:00:53.297429

(Photo by Tony Webster/ Minnesota Reformer)State and federal lawmakers from Rhode Island offered condolences and calls to action in the wake of a pair of shootings that killed one Minnesota state lawmaker Saturday, and injured another. 
Democratic Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed early Saturday in their Brooklyn Park home. Hortman was Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives from 2019 through the end of the 2024 legislative session, leading the push for universal free lunches in the state’s public schools, legalization of recreational cannabis, and expanded gun safety laws.
Minnesota House Democratic leader dead after ‘politically motivated assassination’

A second state lawmaker, Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot multiple times and injured in their Champlin home. The Hoffmans were in a stable condition after being rushed to the hospital, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Saturday’s shootings were part of what appears to be a “politically motivated assassination,” according to news reports.
Gov. Dan McKee expressed sympathy in a social media post Saturday afternoon.
“Our hearts break for Minnesota today,” McKee posted on X. “Political violence is a threat to democracy — it has no place in our country.”
Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in a statement he was “heartbroken” by the death of Hortman, who he knew from attending national conferences. The two had dinner last December, Shekarchi said.
He described Hortman as a warm, kind, and intelligent lawmaker who cared deeply for her state.
“There is no place for senseless violence in our political system,” Shekarchi said.
Senate President Valarie Lawson also posed the tragedy as a call to action. “In the United States, we settle our differences at the ballot box, and we share a common commitment to peace, justice, and the rule of law,” Lawson said in a statement. “No one should have to worry that their willingness to enter public service has made them a target.”
Rhode Island Democratic Party Chairwoman Liz Beretta-Perik singled out President Donald Trump, who she urged to call for a “more civil discourse.”
“There is a sad inevitability about this tragedy in a time marked by elevated rhetoric and vitriol,” Beretta-Perik said in a statement. “Our political culture must change.”
Members of Rhode Island’s Congressional delegation also shared public sympathies on social media.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo posted on X that he was saddened to hear of Hortman’s assassination, along with the attempt on the Hoffmans. He called on all Americans to denounce politically motivated violence, which he said endangers the nation’s democracy and public servants.
U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner said he was monitoring the targeted shootings, which he called “horrific.”
“As Homeland Security Ranking Member for Counterterrorism, I will ask for a full briefing once the facts are known, and urge everyone to remain calm this weekend,” he posted on X.
Authorities suspect 57-year-old Vance Boelter as the shooter, according to news reports. He remained at large as of Saturday afternoon.

In Tallahassee, several groups came together four weeks ago to organize the protest that drew thousands to the Florida Historic Capitol, said Claudia Sperber, one of the co-organizers and the president of the Leon County Chapter of the Democratic Environmental Caucus of Florida. 
Organizers emphasized safety training in their preparations for Saturday, in light of the warnings earlier this week from state and local officials promising to quash violent protests by any means necessary.

“We wanted to be careful, but we refused to be bullied,” Sperber said. “We know it is a classic playbook from a dictator to make people feel afraid, and we refused to be afraid.” 
Approximately 5,000 protested in Tallahassee, according to the organizers. That number is not independently verified.
During a Thursday press conference with Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey warned protesters that disobeying or hurting law enforcement would lead to arrests and death. 
“If you throw a brick, a fire bomb, or point a gun at one of our deputies, we will be notifying your family where to collect your remains at because we will kill you, graveyard dead,” he said. 
The Tallahassee event was unfolding as news flashed about a shooting in Minnesota where a Democratic legislator and her husband were killed, and another legislator and his wife were seriously injured. That prompted authorities in that state to warn people against attending the rallies.
However, the demonstration in the state capital, which started at 10 a.m., remained peaceful. There was a group of four Trump supporters in the crowd. 
Chants, songs, and speeches filled the air for four hours. “Stand up, fight back. Stop the madman now,” a group of women sang. 
Even as the official programming ended, crowds remained in front of the Florida Historic Capitol and lining up along Monroe Street, one of the city’s main roads. Among those who attended the event were Nikki Fried, the chair of the Florida Democratic Party, and Rick Wilson, the famed anti-Trumper and co-founder of the Lincoln Project.
Brizeida Patiño, 19, said she came to the protest to stand up for her parents, who immigrated from Mexico, and the immigrant community in Tallahassee. More than two weeks ago, federal immigration officials and Florida Highway Patrol conducted the largest raid in the state so far to crack down on illegal immigration, targeting a construction site near the Florida State University campus. 
“My parents immigrated from Mexico, trying to seek a better life for me, my siblings, and they’ve done a great job, and they’ve done no harm to this country,” she said. “Matter of fact, they’ve definitely made it better. They’re hard-working people, the same way all these other Hispanic, Latino, people of color.”

St. Petersburg
There were protests all over the state, including one near Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach resort and home of Trump. Meanwhile, in St. Petersburg, more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered on the street corners of three different intersections.
Many of the protesters’ signs in St. Pete expressed anger about the unprecedented number of raids of undocumented immigrants performed by the U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) in recent months. Public protests against one such raid last week in Los Angeles compelled President Trump to call up 2,000 soldiers from California’s Guard against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom, which has few precedents in U.S. history.
“He’s deporting people unlawfully,” said St. Petersburg resident Neil Pajwa. “They’re not getting proper due process. He’s using the military, which has almost never been used before.  I think he’s setting himself up to basically be a dictator.”
Pajwa said he was particularly disturbed by a speech that Trump gave at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, this week where uniformed soldiers cheered the president’s political comments. “I’ve never seen the military vocally supporting such statements,” he said. “That was very scary.”                  
Rhonda Keller said she’s not confident that protests bring about change but said it was important for her to participate in Saturday’s No Kings Event. She noted that in the past 48 hours, Trump has told ICE to pause raids and arrests in the agriculture industry, hotels, and restaurants. For Keller the reversal of policy shows that Trump is a “masterful manipulator.”
“I don’t believe he’s a bright human being, but he is a masterful manipulator and for him to control the narrative and to say, ‘Oh, we need to not hurt our farmworkers this way or our hospitality industry this way.’ Like dude, you were literally the one who is hurting them and now the MAGA people are going to be able to say, ‘See, he doesn’t want to hurt farmworkers,’ even though we are actively hurting them,” Keller said.
Several people in the crowd said to date they have been disappointed with the Democrats, who are in the minority.

Ruth Liss, a senior citizen, walked through the crowd with a sign that read, “Congress: Sale on Balls – you need ‘em!”
“I’m just surprised that he has people who keep kowtowing to him,” she said. “I’m sick and tired of having to hide under the sofa and that’s exactly what Congress is doing. That’s what everybody in a suit seems to be doing,” she said. “I feel that the country is frightened. I think that the country is fed-up, and we don’t know what to do and this is the only way we can start.” 
While most in the St. Petersburg rally expressed optimism about the future, none thought that the political situation in Washington would immediately course correct anytime soon.
“It’s going to get worse before it’s going to get better but it starts here, right?” said Keara Kersey. “It just brings awareness, and we’re getting a lot of support here. Maybe it changes some minds.”
Kearsey said she had been uncertain about attending Saturday’s event because of fears of violence breaking out. She said she was disturbed to hear Gov. Ron DeSantis say this week that drivers who feel threatened by protestors should hit them with their cars.
“It’s our right to free speech to protest,” Kearsey responded. “You don’t see any violence around here.”

Melissa Hartman talks to colleagues during a special legislative session Monday, June 9, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Hortman’s husband was also shot and killed, the governor said.
Walz, appearing emotional at a press conference in the north metro, said they were killed in an apparent “politically motivated assassination.”
“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said. The Associated Press, citing law enforcement sources, reported Saturday that the suspect being sought is 57-year-old Vance Boelter.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Minnesota Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

By early afternoon people lined both sides of the street in front of the State House. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)A crowd that appeared to number in the thousands packed the lawn in front of the State House and lined North Main Street in Concord Saturday, joining a nationwide protest against President Donald Trump.
Concord’s demonstration was one of more than 30 planned throughout the Granite State. On the Seacoast, protesters gathered at Market Square in Portsmouth. Additionally, an anti-ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) protest in Manchester Friday drew hundreds, and protesters returned for another rally in the city on Saturday. No Kings, the national group organizing the event, also advertised protests in Nashua, Enfield, Dover, Littleton, and Milford. Protests took place in all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and Canada, according to No Kings.
Protesters in Concord held signs, participated in chants, and listened to speakers denouncing ICE raids, threats to curtail the rights of trans Americans, and Trump’s efforts to consolidate power, among other actions. A podium was also set up where protest organizers, activists, politicians, candidates, and others spoke.
The event was scheduled to coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C., that Trump organized on both the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army’s founding and his own 79th birthday. Trump said parade protesters would be met with “very heavy force.” Saturday’s demonstrations also come amid tense protests that have been taking place for over a week in Los Angeles against Trump’s deportation raids. Trump has mobilized the National Guard to Los Angeles to respond to the protests, which have at times gotten violent, and to protect immigration officials as they carry out deportations, according to press reports from California.
Earlier Saturday, two Minnesota Democratic state lawmakers and their spouses were shot by someone posing as a police officer. State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, and Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were seriously injured. In the wake of the assassination, New Hampshire House Democratic Leader Alexis Simpson sent an email to her colleagues, which was obtained by the Bulletin, warning them to “consider keeping a lower profile today than we might normally keep,” encouraging them “to not identify ourselves as state reps,” and “pay attention to your surroundings and trust your instincts.”
“This tragedy does not exist in a vacuum,” Simpson wrote. “We are living in a time of rising political violence and it is incumbent upon us to make sure that not only are we calling it out, but that we are protecting ourselves appropriately. It is a good idea to be in touch with your local law enforcement and let them know of the situation especially if you are having a rally in your town or city.”

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Repeated bursts of drenching rain didn’t scare away the thousands of Hoosiers amassing at the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to protest the policies and actions of President Donald Trump, who celebrated his 79th birthday in Washington D.C. today.
Trump’s birthday coincided with the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. Both were honored with a military parade in the nation’s capital as protesters gathered across the country for “No Kings” protests.
“I want to be on the right side of history,” said Fiona Betts, of Marion County.
Upwards of 3,000 Hoosiers attended Saturday’s protest, according to the Indiana State Police, who monitored the event from the perimeter and detained at least one participant after a scuffle with an opposing protester. 
Attendees marched nonstop around the Indiana Statehouse for a few hours, chanting about democracy to a constant stream of car horns down Capitol Avenue.
Organizers repeatedly emphasized a nonviolent approach, distributing whistles to alert security of any counterprotesters “that may try to cause trouble” and advising the crowd not to engage with them.

Mother-daughter duo, Rhonda and Donna Clair, came because “we’re worried about our democracy.”
“Our immigrants are not getting their due process and people are being snatched out of their schools and workplaces. We’re worried that equality is not (getting) attention too,” continued Rhonda Clair. “We just want people to be treated with dignity and respect and we’re not seeing that.”
Rhonda Clair, who decorated crowns for her and her mother, also mentioned international affairs as a concern, specifically whether America was alienating longstanding allies. 
Several signs likened Trump’s actions with those of dictatorship, with one Hoosier comparing raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement with Adolph Hitler’s Gestapo. Other common themes were “FDT,” a curse for the president, No Kings pictograms and tacos. 
Saturday’s event coincided with Indianapolis’ Pride celebration and the Indiana Pacers’ appearance in the 2025 NBA Finals, with all three crowds intermingling in the streets of downtown Indianapolis. 
Many attendees went to both the Pride parade, which started at 10 a.m., and the No Kings protest, including husbands Brad and Doug Cope-Barnes. 
“We have to show up. We need to see that there are other people who care and who think like we do,” said Doug Cope-Barnes. “It’s not all grim and hopeless; we need hope.” 
State Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, also spoke of hope, encouraging the crowd to build a better future and vote against the state’s Republican supermajority in future elections.
“This country was built on the radical idea that power comes from the people. And we the people still hold that power today,” Hamilton said. “… let’s take back our democracy! Let’s get to work!”
A few hundred protesters lingered as the event wound down at 3 p.m. and organizers struck their tents. Many of the remaining attendees held sodden pieces of cardboard with barely legible writing or left their signs to adorn the southern Statehouse lawn. Others vowed to come back, buoyed by the large crowd and optimistic spirit — and hopeful that the weather would be better next time.

Melissa Hartman talks to colleagues during a special legislative session Monday, June 9, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Hortman’s husband was also shot and killed, the governor said.
Walz, appearing emotional at a press conference in the north metro, said they were killed in an apparent “politically motivated assassination.”
“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said. The Associated Press, citing law enforcement sources, reported Saturday that the suspect being sought is 57-year-old Vance Boelter.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)At least 400 people gathered in Montgomery Saturday morning as part of nationwide “No Kings” demonstrations, protesting the actions and policies of President Donald Trump, which protestors called undemocratic. 
The rally Thursday was the first of at least 14 similar protests scheduled around the state and among thousands taking place around the country. The protests also rejected a planned military parade Saturday coinciding with Trump’s birthday and Flag Day. 
Those who gathered at the Alabama Department of Archives and History, across from the Alabama State Capitol, said they were concerned the administration was not following the law, particularly on applying due process to immigrants facing deportation.
Brenda Andrade, a Montgomery resident, said her mother, a naturalized citizen who immigrated to the United States before her birth, is scared by those policies. 
“We don’t think it’s fair that we are being pushed away in such violence when we created and built this country, alongside every other immigrant, every other person,” she said.

The “No Kings” protests across the nation come amid protests in Los Angeles pushing back against immigration raids, where protesters have clashed with ICE and deployed troops. 
The protests in Montgomery were peaceful. A group of about 10 counter-protesters, some covering their faces, tried to interrupt the speakers, but their march lasted less than 15 minutes as their chants were drowned out by “No Kings” protestors.

Standing across the Alabama Capitol, Ryan Burgener held an upside-down American flag signaling distress and said that his main priority was protecting his friends and neighbors who are U.S. permanent residents, as he sees the “pain and anguish” they are feeling. He said he is also concerned about the economy and the potential negative impacts of the proposed reconciliation bill that is currently being considered by the Senate.
“This is going to put us trillions of dollars further into debt, and we can presume it’ll benefit those in the top end of the tax bracket, and that’s really concerning to me,” he said.
Debora Summerlin, an Elmore County resident, said that she came out to protest the “fascism” and “cruelty” of the current administration.
“I hope we ruin his parade. I hope we piss him off, and I hope we show other people in Alabama about how passionate we are about protecting the Constitution,” Summerlin said.
Jessica Campbell, who came out with her husband and two daughters, said that it was important for them to come out “for family” and “anybody who’s different, who doesn’t have a voice. She said if they don’t speak up, things won’t get better, and “everybody needs to see the country say he needs to go.”
Reverend E.K. Daufin, an advisor at the National Organization for Women, Campus Action Network at Alabama State University, encouraged the crowd to speak up and “fight back against the fascist regime” by attending protests, contacting elected officials and voting.
“We are an example of people trying to fix the lies people are telling about those of us whose ideas and principles don’t align with those of this current administration,” she said.
JaTaune Bosby Gilchrist, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, encouraged people to push back against what she called chaos “that is sent to confuse us and to exhaust us.”
“We have to reimagine a space where we can all come together. We can’t be tired. We can’t be weakened. We have the things that we need,” Gilchrist said to the crowd.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PXL_20250614_154310363-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-06-14 16:02:58.972567

Like most protests this week in the heartland, Lincoln’s protest was peaceful","Roughly 2,000 protesters in downtown Lincoln protest the Trump administration on Jun. 14, 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Hundreds of U.S. flags fluttered in the air of Nebraska’s capital city in protest of the Trump administration. 
The protests in Lincoln and at least 11 other Nebraska cities were part of planned national protests against the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts, cuts to federal services and a military parade to celebrate the U.S. Army’s anniversary and Flag Day in Washington, D.C., a date that overlaps with Trump’s 79th birthday.  
A reporter-estimated crowd of roughly 2,000 protesters in Lincoln stretched across O Street, the main road through downtown, chanting “no kings” and “Donald Trump got to go.” Protesters held signs criticizing the Department of Government Efficiency’s cuts, the administration’s immigration approach and stating that the nation has “no kings,” while holding U.S. flags, including some flown upside-down, a step often used as a signal of distress. 
Some also held Mexican flags. Others, a Palestinian flag.

Cars passing by honked in support of the protesters. Trenton Morales, 17, said he came out to protest against the workplace immigration raid in Omaha this week and other similar raids nationally. 
“My grandpa recently got deported,” Morales said. “That’s one reason why I’m out here.” 
Like most protests this week in Nebraska, this one was peaceful, though federal officials announced this week that they had arrested four protesters from the site of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement-led raid site, Glenn Valley Foods, alleging the four had behaved aggressively and damaged federal property. A duty commander with the Lincoln Police Department said officers had made no protest-related arrests.
Organizers of the Omaha-area protest in Council Bluffs estimated the crowd at Tom Hanafan Park at roughly 10,000 people, including overflow that reached the Bob Kerrey Bridge. Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive independent, called in and elicited cheers when he spoke by phone briefly during the event.
In more rural parts of Nebraska, about 150-200 people protested in several cities, Lincoln-area CBS affiliate KOLN/KGIN reported. 
Before the planned protests this weekend, Gov. Jim Pillen activated the Nebraska National Guard for immediate deployment if needed. Pillen and Nebraska joined other states with conservative governors, such as Texas and Missouri, that activated the Guard in advance. 
“Free speech will be respected and protected in Nebraska,” Pillen said. “But the lawlessness, chaos, and rioting seen in other cities in past weeks will not be tolerated here.” 
On Friday, several hundred protesters marched in downtown Omaha during the opening of the College World Series against the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics. Protest organizers also gathered people in Nebraska’s largest metropolitan area on Saturday at Council Bluffs, Iowa. 
Democrats, nonpartisans and some Republicans who oppose Trump have used the protests as a political rallying cry or organizational tool.
The heartland protests come against the backdrop of larger, tenser protests in Los Angeles as a result of ICE raids there over the past week. Los Angeles has sparked similar protests in Democratic-leaning parts of the country and purple and blue pockets of conservative-led states. 
The Trump administration seemed to acknowledge some of the public pushback nationally and perhaps industry-level pushback from farmers, meatpackers and food processors with new guidance this week pausing some immigration raids and arrests in the agriculture and hospitality industries, according to a Friday report in the New York Times. 
In Nebraska, some industry groups have warned of risks of cracking down too hard on certain industries and businesses without addressing the root cause of illegal hiring, lack of workers, and the need for a clearer path to legal immigration. 
Organizers behind the nationwide ‘No King’ protests include Indivisible, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the 50501 Movement. Some branded Saturday as a “day of defiance” against what they call authoritarian overreach by the Trump administration.
Nebraska State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, appeared at the downtown protest, saying he didn’t expect this much turnout.
“It shows just how angry people are … [and] it’s good for people to see that there’s this much opposition to all the bad stuff that’s happening right now,” Dungan said.

No shots were fired.
Kase Cosgrove, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and safety volunteer attending the protest, said he approached the man after other protesters told him the man was armed and spitting and shoving people while walking through the crowd.
Cosgrove said he walked toward the man and saw him tapping on what appeared to be a handgun and pulling it out of its holster to show people he was armed. Cosgrove approached him and attempted to talk to him but three police officers quickly arrived, retrieved the weapon and put the man in handcuffs.

Cosgrove said the protest — part of a nationwide protest against the Trump administration — has been peaceful and fittingly musical, being in Music City.
Thousands of people attended the protest, lining the sidewalks along Jefferson Street and Rosa Parks Blvd. and walking through Bicentennial Park after a brief gathering at the park’s amphitheater. Cheers, musical instruments and car horns echoed up and down the street.
Protesters ranged in age from young adults to the elderly, and many people brought children and dogs.
“Everybody else is being chill,” said Cosgrove. ”  . . . He was trying to cause problems.”
Protesters yelled at the man as police put him into an MNPD golf cart. Cosgrove was among them, shouting, “You got tread on!”
The man, still masked, responded by showing the crowd his middle finger.
As police drove away protesters turned toward the officers and said, “thank you for keeping us safe.”
A spokesperson for Metro Police told the Lookout they did not yet have the man’s name.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman, who was among the most influential Minnesota elected officials of the past decade, died on Saturday morning after a man impersonating a police officer shot her in her Brooklyn Park home, Gov. Tim Walz said.
Hortman’s husband was also shot and killed, the governor said.
Walz, appearing emotional at a press conference in the north metro, said they were killed in an apparent “politically motivated assassination.”
“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

Josh Shapiro called on leaders across the country to speak and act with moral clarity in the wake of the “politically motivated assassination” of a Democratic state lawmaker in Minnesota.
The governor posted a statement on the social platform X, formerly called Twitter, just before noon. It came about 90 minutes after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz held a press conference announcing the death of House Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman. She and her husband were shot and killed Saturday morning in her Brooklyn Park home by a man impersonating a police officer.
“Leaders across our country must speak and act with the moral clarity this moment demands,” Shapiro said. “This is unacceptable — we all have a responsibility to stand up and work to defeat the political violence that is tearing through our country. America is better than this.”

Democratic Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
“We are praying for the family of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, and all of their loved ones who have suffered an immeasurable loss. We’re praying for the full recovery of Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, and for their families, loved ones, and communities at home and in Saint Paul.” Shapiro said. “I communicated with Gov. Walz this morning to offer my prayers and support. To the people of Minnesota: Pennsylvania stands with you.”
The shooter is still at large. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams in Minnesota are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
Law enforcement said when officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer. In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
The governor said he spoke with state Senate President Pro Tem Kim Ward and state House Speaker Joanna McClinton and offered the administration’s support in the aftermath of the Minnesota shootings.
Shapiro said he and his wife, Lori, were pained by the news of yet another act of political violence. In April,  Shapiro and his family were evacuated from the governor’s residence after a firebombing damaged part of the first floor of the building. It happened after Shapiro celebrated the first night of Passover. 
38-year-old Cody Balmer of Harrisburg was charged in connection to what police say was a “targeted attack.” Police said Balmer admitted hatred toward Shapiro and planned to beat him with a hammer if he encountered Shapiro inside the home.
The Minnesota shootings occurred on the same day thousands of non-violent demonstrations are being held across Pennsylvania and the country that were organized by a partnership of labor, Democratic and anti-Trump organizations. An unprecedented military parade is also scheduled for later today in Washington, D.C., to coincide with President Donald Trump’s birthday.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250609_0089-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-14 14:03:10.478691

Another 3,000 people demonstrated outside Liberty Plaza, according to a police estimate. A small number of counter protesters were present, but no incidents or arrests were reported.
The demonstration was one of about two dozen protests against the administration of President Donald Trump in Georgia. Nationally, about 2,000 events were planned Saturday under the banner of “No Kings” day.
“It fills my heart. I’m so glad that people are here,” said Adam Zarett, an IT professional from Atlanta. “I’m glad to see so many people here standing up for our constitutional rights, making our voices heard. Like John Lewis, good trouble.”
Zarett said he wasn’t much for protests until recently.
“I didn’t even care about politics before Trump came into office the first time, and it stung then, and it is so much worse now,” he said. “It has just ignited a fire inside me that says you can’t just sit behind a keyboard and complain on Facebook all day. That just doesn’t do much. Sometimes it feels good, but it doesn’t do much.”
Now, Zarett says he’ll be back.
“I absolutely will. As many protests as there are, as many gatherings as there are, the people need to be heard,” he said.
Converting keyboard warriors to sign-wavers was part of the goal for “No Kings” organizers like Ezra Levin, cofounder of the progressive Indivisible organization.
In a streamed planning session Thursday, Levin said planning for the nationwide series of protests began when Trump announced a military parade in Washington, before protests in Los Angeles and a crackdown from the federal government became a national flashpoint.
The Washington event, which has come under fire for its projected cost of up to $45 million, coincides with the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States Army and Trump’s 79th birthday.
“Trump can have his pathetic little party in D.C. We’re everywhere else,” Levin said. “We are flying American flags everywhere. We’re featuring veterans on stage. We’re showing up with patriotic zeal. Most importantly, we are showing up in force in red, blue and purple communities in defense of our constitutional rights.”
There was plenty of red, white and blue on display in Atlanta – some came dressed in patriotic colors, and others waved mini American flags handed out by volunteers. Some faces in the crowd turned red as well as the triple threat of sun, humidity and tightly packed bodies raised the temperature in the plaza. Volunteers handed out bottles of water and paper fans to help fight off the worst effects of the heat.
  Several protesters and speakers made reference to Martin Luther King Jr., who they characterized as the only good “king” in the United States. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The name of the event is a reference to what opponents say is Trump’s desire to subvert democracy and rule as an autarch, but many signs made reference to a different kind of King – civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., who called Atlanta home. Several protesters held signs saying King is the only king recognized in Atlanta.
Another genre of popular hometown signage paid tribute to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Firings at the public health agency became the local symbol of federal job cuts opponents characterize as harmful and chaotic.
Anna Yousaf, an infectious disease doctor who works with vaccines at the CDC, stood near the front of the crowd with members of Fired But Fighting, a coalition of terminated workers. Yousaf said she came out to oppose Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who she said is undermining public trust in vaccines to deadly effect.
“Disinformation used to be coming from non-governmental sources,” she said. “Now, RFK Jr. is hijacking political organizations like the CDC, like the FDA, and using our name brand, if you will, to spread disinformation. And so people who would ordinarily go to a CDC resource for trusted information, now they’re going to get disinformation from the health secretary of the United States.”
“If he succeeds in his crusade to undermine vaccine confidence and restrict access, we will see thousands of people die, mostly children,” she added.
Yousaf and thousands of others listened and cheered as speakers took the stage to criticize the White House on policies ranging from mass immigration raids to laws targeting transgender Americans to U.S. support for Israel’s actions in Gaza.
Protesters dispersed peacefully around noon, with some lingering to bop along with a small marching band. Organizers encouraged participants to walk to an early Juneteenth celebration a few blocks away.
“Joy is also resistance in times like these,” said organizer Laura Judge. “So we’re encouraging people to move on down to the Juneteenth parade, support Black liberation, the purpose of Juneteenth, to be an ally to other people that are being marginalized.”
Other protests not affiliated with “No Kings” were scheduled for Saturday, including one at a plaza in northeast Atlanta.
“It’s good to get out and show that I don’t stand with the fascist pigs in power,” said Greg Drummond, an archivist from Gwinnett County who attended the “No Kings” protest at Liberty Plaza. “My main issue that I normally come out for is anti-capitalism. Unfortunately, I’m here with a bunch of capitalists, but I’m doing what we have to do here. I think actions later in the day will be more my speed.”
“The leftists and the liberals have to be allies until the revolution’s over, then we can hash out our differences,” he added. “But until then, we all have to stand strong against the fascism. If we let them rip us apart, then we’re all doomed, and we must stand up to it.”
  Organizers said 5,000 people filled Liberty Square, and police estimated about 3,000 more listened from outside the gate. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder

Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)Demonstrators were expected to gather at Lincoln Veterans Memorial Park near the Colorado Capitol on Saturday afternoon during one of over 40 protests planned across the state to coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C., and President Donald Trump’s birthday.
The Colorado demonstrations are part of a “nationwide day of defiance” by the organizers of the movement, dubbed “No Kings.” The national call for mass demonstrations is in response to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts, federal funding cuts, defiance of judges in immigration cases and the planned military parade, which could cost up to $45 million. The administration says the parade is to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the creation of the Continental Army, also known as Flag Day.
There has not been a military parade in the nation’s capital since 1991 to mark the end of the first Gulf War. Trump critics characterize Saturday’s parade as a theatrical display similar to ones hosted by authoritarian leaders abroad.
There were similar protests in Grand Junction, Montrose, Alamosa, Lamar and along the entire Front Range.

The protest comes after multiple demonstrations in Denver against deportation efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including a march to an ICE detention center in Aurora on Monday and a large gathering at the Capitol on Tuesday evening. Law enforcement deployed smoke and pepper balls against a group of protesters that marched near the interchange of Broadway and Interstate 25 on Tuesday and made 18 arrests related to the demonstration.
Early Saturday, two Democratic state lawmakers and their spouses were attacked in targeting shootings, leaving Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband dead, according to Minnesota authorities.
The official website of the “No Kings” protest expresses a “commitment to nonviolent action.”
Tension across the country has escalated since last weekend when ICE agents undertook raids at restaurants and workplaces in Los Angeles and the surrounding area. That prompted protests in the city, where there were some clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. Trump then sent Marines and California National Guard troops, against state and local leaders’ wishes, into L.A.
Groups including Indivisible Denver Action and the Colorado chapter of 50501 organized a fair alongside Saturday’s protest to host a food drive, music, games and showcase the work of various local activist groups.
The “No Kings” demonstration and fair is scheduled until 4 p.m. A separate protest, specifically against ICE, is scheduled for 4 p.m. at the Capitol.

 Minnesota shooter at large, Brooklyn Park under order to shelter in place

Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.

 Hortman’s legacy in Minnesota politics

Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, president and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.

Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/14/no-kings-protest-connecticut/,The 'No Kings' protest drew thousands of people to the state Capitol in Hartford to demonstrate against President Trump's policies.,"Thousands of people braved a light rain and gathered outside the state Capitol in Hartford to protest President Donald Trump’s policies as part of a nationwide “No Kings” rally.
It was one of 33 rallies scheduled across Connecticut on Saturday and thousands across the country.
Protestors of all ages cheered speakers while holding handmade signs: “Americans Against King Trump,” “Stop the Steal of our Democracy,” “Democracy Not Oligarchy.” Protesters also pointed to recent detentions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including recent detention of CT residents in Southington, Meriden and New Haven.
“Connecticut is not exempt, it’s not safe, families are being torn apart in our neighborhoods, and it’s time to say, ‘not on our watch,’” said Tabitha Sookdeo, executive director of CT Students for a Dream. Sookdeo led the crowd in a chant that nearly rose to a scream: “ICE out of Connecticut!”

“We’ve got to keep bobbing and weaving and shaking and baking until justice is achieved by every one of us in this land,” Bishop John Selders told the crowd.
The crowd, estimated by Capitol Police to be in the thousands, was animated. In the midst of the crowd, a small of group of counterprotestors briefly attempted to interrupt the event but were quickly silenced. Shouts of “shame!” could be heard as a trio of men, including one wearing a Make America Great Again hat, ran away from the protest.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal told the fired-up crowd that they needed to keep in one word over the next months: “elections.” “When we fight,” Blumenthal said, “we win.” The crowd responded. Blumenthal thanked Trump for the invitation to his parade, but said, “I’d rather be here.”
Rep. John Larson then addressed the crowd: “No kings is the appropriate theme. Why?” Larson then turned to U.S. history and Thomas Paine’s pamphlet, “Common Sense.” “It’s not going to be the current United States Congress that will change things,” but rather the people, he said. “Rise up America!”
The protests in Hartford and across the country serve as a counter to Trump’s military parade, which is scheduled to begin later today and will commemorate both the president’s 79th birthday and the Army’s 250th year.
The parade faced criticism in recent days, particularly from veteran and military-related organizations frustrated at Trump’s embrace of military imagery and symbols.
“At a time when the world is on edge, with escalating conflict between Israel and Iran and other serious threats abroad, we should be laser-focused on military readiness and defense,” Janessa Goldbeck, a Marine Corps veteran and CEO of the Vet Voice Foundation, a national group encouraging veterans to become civic and policy leaders, said in a statement provided to CT Mirror ahead of the weekend events.
“I served to protect our nation, not to see the military turned into a prop for domestic theater,” she said.

Standing across the street from the Capitol days after leaving the hospital, former Army platoon leader and Vietnam War veteran Richard Foster agreed. 
“If he succeeds in politicizing the military, this country may never get it back,” Foster, who lives in West Hartford, said. “The military is supposed to be nonpolitical, and he’s turning it into a political body loyal to him.”

Protests across the nation
Demonstrators began gathering in cities and towns across the U.S. Saturday to rally against Trump as officials urged calm and mobilized National Guard troops ahead a military parade to mark the Army’s 250th anniversary that coincides with the president’s birthday.
Atlanta’s 5,000-capacity “No Kings” rally quickly reached its limit, while intermittent light rain fell as early marchers carrying signs gathered for the flagship rally in Philadelphia’s Love Park.
A woman there wearing a foam Statue of Liberty crown brought a speaker system and led an anti-Trump sing-along, changing the words “young man” in the song “Y.M.C.A.” to “con man.”
Karen Van Trieste, a 61-year-old nurse who drove up from Maryland, said she grew up in Philadelphia and wanted to be with a large group of people showing her support.
“I just feel like we need to defend our democracy,” she said. She is concerned about the Trump administration’s layoffs of staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fate of immigrant communities and the Trump administration trying to rule by executive order, she said.
Protests in nearly 2,000 locations are scheduled across the country, from city blocks and small towns to courthouse steps and community parks, organizers said, but no events are scheduled in Washington, D.C., where the military parade will take place in the evening.
The 50501 Movement orchestrating the protests says it picked the “No Kings” name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration. The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement.
The demonstrations come on the heels of protests that flared up across the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire.
Calling out the National Guard
Governors and city officials vowed to protect the right to protest and to show no tolerance for violence.
Republican governors in Virginia, Texas, Nebraska and Missouri are mobilizing National Guard troops to help law enforcement manage demonstrations.
There will be “zero tolerance” for violence, destruction or disrupting traffic, and “if you violate the law, you’re going to be arrested,” Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin told reporters Friday.
In Missouri, Gov. Mike Kehoe issued a similar message, vowing to take a proactive approach and not to “wait for chaos to ensue.”
Nebraska’s governor also signed an emergency proclamation Friday to activate his state’s National Guard, a step his office called “a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.”
Organizers say that one march will go to the gates of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis warned demonstrators that the “line is very clear” and not to cross it.
Some law enforcement agencies announced they were ramping up efforts for the weekend. In California, state troopers will be on “tactical alert,” which means all days off are canceled for all officers, while West Virginia’s governor put the state police and National Guard on standby.
Governors urging calm
On social media, Washington state Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, called for peaceful protests over the weekend, to ensure Trump doesn’t send military to the state.
“Donald Trump wants to be able to say that we cannot handle our own public safety in Washington state,” Ferguson said.
In a statement Friday, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, urged protesters “to remain peaceful and calm as they exercise their First Amendment right to make their voices heard.”
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said his administration and state police are working with police in Philadelphia ahead of what organizers estimate could be a crowd approaching 100,000 people.
Philadelphia’s top prosecutor, District Attorney Larry Krasner, warned that anyone coming to Philadelphia to break the law or immigration agents exceeding their authority will face arrest. He invoked civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as a guide for demonstrators.
“If you are doing what Martin Luther King would have done, you’re going to be fine,” Krasner told a news conference.
Philadelphia
Several hundred people gathered in Love Park, with organizers handing out small American flags and many people carrying protest signs saying things like “fight oligarchy” and “deport the mini-Mussolinis” as they waited for the march to start.
Some signs bore immigrant-rights messages, including “The wrong ice is melting” and “Unmask ice.”
A handful of people wore gas masks or balaclavas to cover their faces.
One man in Revolutionary War era garb and a tricorn hat held a sign with a quote often attributed to Thomas Jefferson: “All tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.”
Tallahassee, Florida
About a thousand people gathered on the grounds of Florida’s old Capitol, where protesters chanted, “This is what community looks like,” and carried signs with messages like “one nation under distress” and “dissent is patriotic.”
Organizers of the rally explicitly told the crowd to avoid any conflicts with counterprotesters and to take care not to jaywalk or disrupt traffic.

“Our state lost a great leader, and I lost the dearest of friends,” Walz said. “(Hortman) was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota.”
Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times earlier in the evening in their Champlin home. Walz said they were out of surgery, and that he’s “cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.”
Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said Champlin law enforcement received a call at about 2 a.m. that a person shot Hoffman and his wife.
Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley said his officers assisted with the Champlin shooting; a sergeant suggested checking in on Hortman’s home. They live about five to eight miles away from each other. When Brooklyn Park police officers arrived at Hortman’s home, they encountered a person who was dressed like a police officer who “immediately fired at them,” Evans said. Police exchanged gunfire with the person, but they were able to escape.
The shooter is still at large, and Brooklyn Park is under a shelter-in-place order. Hundreds of police officers and SWAT teams are conducting a manhunt for the person, officials said.
Bruley said that when they arrived at Hortman’s home, they saw a police SUV with its lights on and saw the suspect was impersonating a police officer.
In the SUV, police found a “manifesto,” with a list of lawmakers and other officials on it. Hortman and Hoffman were on the list.
Hortman, who has two adult children, was first elected to the Legislature 2004 and served as House Speaker from 2019-2024. She lost two elections before winning, which she said gave her an understanding of what it takes to win swing seats and hold them.
Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.

The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

“These acts of politically motivated violence are horrific and unacceptable. They are a sobering reminder of the hate, division and extremism that too often recently define our politics and threaten our democracy,” Shad Murib, chair of the Colorado Democratic Party, said in a statement. “We must stand united against it as one country.

Her speakership will be remembered as among the most consequential in recent Minnesota political history. With Walz and Senate GOP Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, she guided the state through the pandemic before helping Democrats achieve a trifecta in the 2022 election.
During the 2023 legislative session, she helped bridge the wide gulf between moderates and progressives in her caucus to achieve a historic legislative agenda. Democrats codified abortion rights in law; invested in education, including universal schools meals, as well as transportation and housing; created paid family leave; legalized cannabis; and passed gun control laws.
The encomiums poured in Saturday. “There is no greater champion for Minnesota’s working people than Melissa Hortman,” said Joel Smith, President and Business Manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, the laborers union.
Hoffman was elected in 2012 and is known for his work on human services.
The Reformer sat down with Hortman at the Capitol on Thursday to discuss the 2025 session, which ended on Monday.
During his remarks Saturday, Walz denounced political violence and said the people involved in the shooting would be caught and held responsible.
“This was an act of targeted political violence. Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,” Walz said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, who worked closely with Hortman in the Legislature to negotiate a state budget this year, said she was horrified by Hortman’s murder.
“I am horrified by the evil attack that took place overnight, and heartbroken beyond words by the loss of Speaker-Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark,” Demuth said in a statement.

Measles outbreaks starting in May have grown to 34 cases in North Dakota, giving the state the highest rate in the country, followed by New Mexico and Texas. (Photo courtesy of Visit Fargo-Moorhead)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”










Now they’ve seen measles in their community so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’


– Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas


In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
Outbreak moves north
In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
Mobile clinics aim to boost rural health care, measles vaccinations amid outbreak

“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”
Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas
According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 13, there are 1,197 confirmed cases affecting 34 states. Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 21 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
‘I question it myself’: South Dakota vaccination rates fall amid mistrust and misinformation

That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Lawmakers in both Kansas and Missouri have pursued legislation to make hundreds of millions of dollars available for sports stadiums. (DutcherAerials via Getty Images)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — In promoting his bill to fund professional sports stadiums, Missouri Republican state Sen. Kurtis Gregory warned about the potential hit to jobs and tax revenues if the state were to lose a team.
But on the floor of the Senate last week, he acknowledged that pride was also a prime motivator in his efforts to make hundreds of millions of dollars available to the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs and MLB’s Kansas City Royals, both of which are being courted to move several miles away into neighboring Kansas.
A former University of Missouri football player, Gregory pointed to the Missouri-Kansas rivalry that dates back to the Civil War and characterized Kansas as “kind of an archrival.”
“We just let the state of Kansas poach, you know, really the pride and joy of the western side of the state, and I would say the entire state of Missouri?” he said in his floor speech. “And then I would also say, what’s next? What’s the next thing the state of Kansas is going to try and take from us?”
Days after the 2025 legislative session ended in May, Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called a special session for lawmakers to consider stadium funding and disaster relief bills. Last week, the state Senate approved Gregory’s stadium incentives bill in the middle of the night by a 19-13 vote. On Wednesday afternoon, the state House approved the measure by a 90-58 vote, sending it to the governor’s desk.
The bill would fund up to 50% of construction or renovation costs and is estimated to cost about $1.5 billion over 30 years, the Missouri Independent reported.
Stateline was unable to reach Gregory for comment.
Economists have panned the ongoing stadium bidding war between Missouri and Kansas — which has offered to pay up to 70% of new stadium costs — as a waste of taxpayer dollars. But Gregory’s comments highlight the emotional undercurrents frequently at play in sports stadium funding debates across the country.
Experts nearly unanimously agree that public subsidies for stadiums are a poor investment, but that hasn’t slowed a wave of local and state spending for billionaire team owners.
Washington, D.C., could spend more than $1 billion to move the Washington Commanders some seven miles from a suburb in Maryland to a new facility planned for the old RFK Stadium site, described by the team’s controlling owner as the “spiritual home” of the NFL franchise.
Geoffrey Propheter, an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who studies stadium deals, said these kinds of arguments ignore the economic reality of stadium subsidies.
“You’re not talking economics. You’re talking pure emotion,” he said.
Despite mounds of evidence showing the public does not fare well on stadium investments, he said lawmakers and mayors still tout the potential for jobs and new tax revenues with stadiums and arenas.
Oftentimes, teams and politicians stir fears about the possibility of losing franchises to another market to increase pressure, he said. But three of the most prominent stadium subsidy deals under consideration now — in Chicago, Kansas City and the district — involve teams looking to move within the same metro area.
“I would appreciate it if lawmakers were that transparent, and they’re like, ‘I don’t care how much this costs, there’s no price that’s too high for us to pay to keep them here,’” Propheter said.
 
‘Generations to get past’
But cities and states have more at stake than raw economics, said Irwin Kishner, a New York attorney who has represented pro teams in multiple stadium deals.
He likened the stadium debate to those surrounding the Olympics: Research has found that host cities generally spend well in excess of the revenue generated by the games. But cities and nations still fiercely compete for the chance to host the high-profile event.
“It elevates the status of venues,” Kishner said. “And I think it’s very much the same thing with stadiums and arenas.”
He said cities also face potential economic consequences of lost jobs and tax revenues if teams leave altogether.
Oakland, California, for example, lost both its pro football and baseball teams to Nevada after local stadium talks fell apart. The NFL’s Raiders now play in Las Vegas and MLB’s A’s are playing temporarily in West Sacramento, California, before moving into their under-construction stadium on the Vegas strip.
“What happened in Oakland is a classic example of what happens when a team doesn’t get their building in the way they want it,” Kishner said.
And those sorts of relocations can leave lasting marks, he said, pointing to the sour feelings that still persist in Brooklyn decades after MLB’s Dodgers left for Los Angeles. Other cities have similarly iconic teams, such as the NFL’s Chicago Bears.
“When push comes to shove, municipalities would be embarrassed to lose a team. I mean, could you imagine the Bears playing in St. Louis as an argument?” Kishner said. “I think Chicago would have something to say about that in a very emotional way. And by the way, these things take generations to get past.”
Currently, Chicago’s stadium discussions are more localized.
After first sharing plans to build a new stadium along Lake Michigan’s shore in Chicago, the Bears are now pursuing a massive football stadium development in suburban Arlington Heights. Despite introducing various tax measures aimed to benefit megaprojects such as stadiums, Illinois lawmakers ended their session on May 31 with no action on the matter.
Democratic state Rep. Kam Buckner, whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side, said lawmakers have little appetite to invest heavily in stadiums.
The MLS’ Chicago Fire just announced plans to privately finance a new $650 million professional soccer stadium in the city’s South Loop — the same area the MLB’s White Sox are also eyeing as they explore a new baseball stadium.
“The days of widespread public money for private stadiums without public benefit — those days are over, and that is not just a sentiment in the state of Illinois. I think this is a sentiment across the country,” Buckner said.
Still, he acknowledged the sway emotions can have in the matter. While the Bears leaving the city limits likely would not affect the region’s economy, he said, it would still prove a blow to morale.
“My brain tells me it’s not that big of a deal,” he said, “but my heart and soul as a Chicagoan doesn’t want them to leave.”
 
Money matters
Missouri’s stadium debate has been simmering for years now: The Royals first announced plans in 2022 to move downtown from their stadium on the outskirts of the city. And the Chiefs — who share the sprawling stadium complex with the Royals — quickly followed with talks of wanting a new or renovated stadium.
After voters in a county election last year soundly rejected extending a stadium sales tax to fund those plans, lawmakers across the border in Kansas passed legislation that would fund up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums. That measure expires at the end of June, pushing Missouri legislators to act.
Neil deMause, a journalist who has written extensively about stadium subsidies, said such deadlines are arbitrary and meant to exact political pressure.
While politicians once had plausible deniability about the pitfalls of stadium subsidies, the research is now overwhelmingly clear and well covered in the media, he said. (It’s been nearly a decade since HBO’s John Oliver dedicated an episode of his satirical news show to the folly of stadium finance.)
But politicians on both sides of the aisle continue to push stadium subsidies — whether they’re touting the potential for wider real estate development or intangibles such as team pride and fears of losing franchises.
“It’s this prescribed dance, where everybody sort of pretends to be doing due diligence, but at the same time, everybody knows it’s going to happen,” deMause said.
He said that appears to be the case in the nation’s capital.
In April, city and team officials for the Washington Commanders announced plans for a 65,000-seat stadium. The proposed deal, which must be approved by the full city council, would cost taxpayers some $1.1 billion over eight years.
But deMause’s analysis of the plan determined the public will be spending well in excess of that figure because of billions in free rent and hundreds of millions in property tax breaks. He estimates taxpayers will pay or forgo at least $7.5 billion on the deal.
“Everybody in and around the D.C. Council seems to be saying, ‘Yeah, it sure is a lot of money, but the mayor really wants it, so it’s going to happen. It’s just a matter of whether or not we can improve it some,’” he said. “It’s a little bit like saying, ‘World War II is going to happen — just try and keep the death toll down.’”
Last week, Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office released a report it commissioned that projected the stadium would create billions in new economic output and local tax revenue in the coming decades — figures that were quickly disputed by skeptical economists and academics.
Still, much of the district’s stadium conversation has centered on intangibles such as hometown pride and nostalgia. Even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell waxed about his childhood memories attending games at the old RFK Stadium at an April event announcing the deal.
Sitting in front of a “WELCOME HOME” banner at that event, the mayor said the RFK site was “where they belong.”
“I want to start by saying welcome home,” she said.

When Joe Lemnah’s savings ran dry, VEDA’s support let BBCo.’s beer flow.

After home-brewing back in 2006, Joe Lemnah moved around the areas where the breweries were hopping, including to Delaware, the home of Dogfish Head. At Dogfish Head, Lemnah converted his love of home-brewing to the art of commercial brewing. 
His goal, though, was always to bring his talent back to Vermont. After completing the 10,000 or so hours it takes to master the skill, that’s exactly what he did by starting Burlington Beer Company in 2014. 

The company has a 22,000-square-foot production facility in Williston and a brew pub-slash-event-space-slash-hip-hangout in Burlington’s South End, which opened in 2021. 
Lemnah said that with his family’s savings tapped to start the brewery, it was a struggle to find a lender willing to take the leap, particularly a decade ago when the brewery market was quickly becoming saturated. 
“I just went all in,” Lemnah laughed. “It was a pretty rough business plan. I was a brewer by trade and have had to become a business person” 
Thankfully, he said, VEDA and its partners at the National Bank of Middlebury believed in what he wanted to do. 
“VEDA taking chances on people that have that passion means a lot, after getting so many ‘nos’ from the bank,” he said. “VEDA is creating business and jobs in Vermont — it’s very noticeable and appreciated, so when we were growing over the years, we went back to VEDA.” 
This has included the brew house, more tanks, a canning line and so on. It makes for great conversation, Lemnah said: sharing the need for new equipment and projecting the revenue that will come in return.

Plus, Burlington Beer Co. gives back to the community in myriad ways, including special brews for important causes, like the Vermont benefit beer, created in response to major flooding in 2023. 
“We were doing a lot of things through the years that I think the more traditional and even some of the up-and-coming breweries that are making some different styles of beer looked down upon like, ‘Oh, what do you put it in your beer? That’s gross. That’s not beer anymore’” he said. “But it’s fun. Beer was meant to be fun.” 
For Lemnah, it’s important for his personality, his artistic spirit to come through in the taste, the look and the feel of the brand. 
“We’re making liquid art, we’re making label art; we’re just trying to have fun at the end of the day,” he said. 
Without the low-interest financing available through VEDA, Lemnah said, his incredibly capital-intensive small business may have never gotten started.

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/06/la-area-medical-clinic-immigration-agents/,Fear of immigration raids is driving Southern California patients to cancel health care.

Fear of immigration raids is driving Southern California patients to cancel health care. A third of medical appointments and half of dental appointments at St. John’s 28 clinics were cancelled this week.



California hospitals and clinics are on high alert as immigration raids continue and their patients — both legal residents and undocumented immigrants — afraid to step out are increasingly canceling medical appointments.One Los Angeles-area clinic system, St. John’s Community Health, told CalMatters about a close encounter with officials who appeared to be immigration agents. Staff said armed officers wearing tactical gear tried to enter a parking lot in Downey, about 10 miles southeast of Los Angeles, where doctors and nurses in a mobile health clinic were seeing patients, many of them walk-ins from the community. 
Alfredo Contreras, the driver of the mobile clinic, said five unmarked SUVs and vans on Wednesday evening pulled up to a gate in the parking lot where they had set up, located at a drug and alcohol recovery center. Contreras and a security guard stood in front of their vehicles, blocking the entrance.  
Contreras said he and the guard “held our ground, we did not move” and the officers didn’t get out of their vehicles.
“I told (the security guard) ‘Don’t worry, they can’t come in without a warrant,’ so I’m sure they (agents) could hear us because their windows were down,” Contreras said. 
Both of them started walking back as the center’s gate slowly closed in front of them. The agents eventually left after a few minutes, Contreras said.

Peggy Hernandez, the mobile clinic coordinator who also was at the scene, said while Contreras and the security guard dealt with the agents, her staff calmly alerted patients who were waiting in line. None identified themselves as being at risk because of their legal status, but still, she said both patients and staff were shaken up.
“That’s the first time they (immigration officials) have ever come that close to the clinic or to us providing health care services,” said Jim Mangia, CEO of St. John’s Community Health. Staff at the clinics, he said, have been training for this type of situation. 
Growing fear and cancelled health appointments
One of President Donald Trump’s first orders upon taking office in January was to rescind a Biden-era rule that protected “sensitive locations” — places of worship, hospitals, clinics and schools — from immigration operations. 
In an email response to CalMatters, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, did not address whether U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents visited any LA-area medical clinics this week.
But asked why ICE would target such locations, McLaughlin said the administration is protecting “Americans who attend” these sensitive locations “by preventing criminal aliens and gang members from exploiting these locations and taking safe haven there because these criminals knew law enforcement couldn’t go inside under the previous administration.”
“ICE will be using the ‘common sense’ standard for any enforcement actions at these locations, relying on the discretion of the law enforcement officer.”TRICIA MCLAUGHLIN, DEPT. OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
“Officers would need secondary supervisor approval before any action can be taken in locations such as a church or a school. We expect these to be extremely rare,” McLaughlin said in the email.
Trump’s directive “gives our law enforcement the ability to do their jobs…ICE will be using the ‘common sense’ standard for any enforcement actions at these locations, relying on the discretion of the law enforcement officer,” she said.
Government data and news reports show that ICE is increasingly detaining people without criminal convictions. The same day that immigration agents tried to enter the Downey parking lot where St. John’s mobile health van was stationed, some also showed up outside two nearby churches where they apprehended people, including one elderly man, according to local news reports.
Health advocates and providers say that rather than protecting people, ICE is scaring people from seeking basic medical care.
That fear is expected to grow, especially after, as the Associated Press first reported Friday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shared Medi-Cal data, including people’s immigration status, with the Department of Homeland Security. California officials, including the state’s Department of Health Care Services which oversees Medi-Cal, have long reassured undocumented immigrants that their personal information would not be shared with federal agencies for immigration enforcement. 
At St. John’s, which has 28 sites across Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire, Mangia estimates that roughly a third of medical appointments and half of dental appointments were cancelled this week.
People have been skipping care out of fear for months now, but recent raids have increased the no-shows and cancellations. When possible, his clinics are turning people to telehealth and a recently-launched home visitation program, he said.
The Hospital Association of Southern California said on Thursday that it was not aware of any immigration enforcement activity inside or directly outside any Southern California hospital campus, but that the chilling effect was noticeable in some emergency waiting rooms.
“Some hospitals have reported a decline in emergency department volume, which raises our concern that individuals may be delaying necessary care out of fear,” Adam Blackstone, a spokesperson for the association, said in a written response. 
“Fear of going outside or being picked up by ICE…can create worse outcomes, such as ending up on my operating room table with an amputation or a ruptured appendix.”SANDY REDING, CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION 
Sandy Reding, an operating room nurse at Bakersfield Memorial Hospital and president of the California Nurses Association, said anecdotes of similar patterns were reported in Bakersfield following January raids there.
The consequences of putting off care are never good, especially for people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, she said.
“Not having the optimal care because of fear of going outside or being picked up by ICE creates delays in care, which can create worse outcomes, such as ending up on my operating room table with an amputation or a ruptured appendix,” Reding said. 
“My concern right now is that we take care of everybody in a timely manner, and that they feel that the hospital is a safe place to go to get care,” she said.
Many patients seeking virtual care
For non-emergency care, patients have more options. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services has published resources for remote care. Included are phone numbers and portals where county clinic patients can call a nurse advice line and request medication drop-offs. The department encourages people who would rather stay home to call their clinic and change their appointments to virtual or phone visits. Officials with the county health department said immigration agents have not entered any of their county health facilities. “However, the mere threat of immigration enforcement near any medical facility undermines public trust and jeopardizes community health,” they wrote in an unsigned email.
People without a preferred clinic may also seek services from organizations such as Zócalo Health, which provides virtual-first care, including mental health visits. The group was created to boost culturally competent care in Latino communities, said CEO Erik Cardenas. Services are available for people throughout California, including those covered by certain Medi-Cal plans. People can call the group’s main line to check insurance eligibility and book appointments online. 
“Having a virtual network of physicians and therapists that look like you, talk like you, think like you, is a really good tool to have right now because it augments access,” Cardenas said. 
Since the pandemic, most clinics and doctors’ offices across the state now offer virtual care. 
‘A devastating contradiction’
The immigration raids are coinciding with major proposed rollbacks in Medi-Cal for undocumented people.
As the state tries to offset a projected $12 billion deficit, Gov. Gavin Newsom last month put out a budget proposal that freezes enrollment and reduces services for this population. State health officials have said the state is spending more on medical coverage and prescription drugs for undocumented enrollees than they anticipated. 
The Legislature, in its own version of the budget, on Friday accepted most of Newsom’s freezes and cuts for immigrants with some modifications. For example, lawmakers want to charge undocumented immigrants $30 a month for their Medi-Cal insurance instead of the $100 that Newsom proposed. Legislators also want a six-month grace period for people to re-enroll if they fall off coverage for missing payments.Lawmakers and Newsom face a June 27 deadline for agreeing on a final budget.
Republican lawmakers say the governor and Democratic lawmakers are responsible for a Medi-Cal expansion that has become unsustainable. “We committed spending to something we can’t afford,” Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican from Roseville and vice chair of the Senate budget committee, has told CalMatters.

Meanwhile, health and immigration advocates are pushing the state to keep immigrants covered, especially in this time of fear.  
Mar Velez, director of policy at the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California, said it doesn’t make sense for Democrats to defend immigrants in the face of the federal immigration raids and at the same time go after their health coverage.
“They’ve been very clear that we need to protect immigrant communities, and so why isn’t the state budget reflecting that?” she said.
Mangia at St. John’s said his clinics’ staff have been getting questions from patients almost daily about the future of their Medi-Cal coverage.
“Our patients are very worried about it,” he said. “And I think it’s a devastating contradiction, on the one hand to have the governor and elected officials say we support immigrants, but when it comes to making sure that they have health care, they’re willing to kind of cut those services away.”

Local residents are living with around-the-clock law enforcement and experiencing vandalism.","In summary
Despite the curfew, people are still coming to downtown LA to participate in immigration protests. Local residents are living with around-the-clock law enforcement and experiencing vandalism.


Days of volatile immigration protests and demonstrations in downtown Los Angeles led to an 8 p.m. area curfew imposed this week by Mayor Karen Bass.   
But even with the local night time movement subdued, helicopters continued to roar overhead at all hours. Law enforcement vehicles blazed through streets en masse — blue and red headlights flashing, sirens piercing.
Demonstrators from other parts of the city and throughout the state still made their way into downtown during the day. They headed toward the federal complex where National Guard and Los Angeles police stood ready for action — along with large congregations of media personnel.
Now, in the communities adjacent to the government center — nearby neighborhoods like Little Tokyo — shops and businesses sit shuttered. Plywood panels cover their windows, and their owners either plan to close early or don’t even bother opening up.
It’s a new and yet familiar reality for those who live and work in downtown L.A. It’s also not clear when it will end, with large protests expected this weekend and troops stationed there indefinitely.
Here’s a look at how the week played out for protesters, shop owners and locals.
‘It’s hard to tell what’s really going on’
At Apple’s Tower Theater store a mile and a half away from Alameda and Temple streets, a heavy wooden barricade now protects the large panoramic glass of the repurposed movie house. Usually abuzz with customers who can be seen from the street, the tech community gathering space sits empty and dormant.
Lisa H. drives into downtown from South Central three or four days a week for her work as a legal consultant. Through hypervigilant eyes, she scanned the sidewalks on the way to her Prius.
“I just hope everyone stays safe out here,” she said, reluctant to give her last name to a reporter. “It’s hard to tell what’s really going on right now. I think folks are coming here with the intention to just stir things up. Doesn’t this feel like it’s all being set up or staged?”
She remembers the 1992 Rodney King riots. “That really was civil unrest. This is something else.”
Meltem Karakova has lived downtown with her husband and toddler for three months.
“It seems safe right here in this neighborhood,” said Karakova, as she pushed her child in a stroller several blocks from the Apple store. “But the noise at night from all the sirens and helicopters gives me a bit of anxiety.” 
Then she gestured in the direction of the federal buildings. “We don’t go over there where it gets crazy.”
LA businesses brace for recurring vandalism
Less than half a mile away in Little Tokyo, business owners said they lost customers and suffered vandalism through the days of protests.
“I’m a Japanese immigrant myself,” said Ryota Sakai, who runs a retail shop on 1st Street. “I have my green card, but I understand the stakes — what others must go through just to be here.”
Sakai said his sales have plummeted since last weekend’s protests. With hardly any retail traffic on Wednesday, he did not know whether he would open his doors again until things returned to normal. Still, he felt fortunate that his storefront had not been vandalized.
“I feel for my neighbors, all down this street and around me,” said Sakai. “The taggers hit their shops for no reason — just because we’re here, I guess. They broke some windows and lit fires, too.”

Joyce Leung has co-owned her clothing and accessories store on 1st Street since 2009. She said her business hasn’t experienced any vandalism or problems with protesters in the area over the years until Tuesday night, right after the curfew went into effect.
“We all hung around out front of our stores along this street, keeping an eye out together as a community until almost 11 p.m.,” said Leung. “But right after we locked up and went upstairs, we heard glass breaking.”
“Yeah, a truck pulled up and shot something at our front door window,” explained employee Sam Du. “I think it was like a BB or pellet gun.”
Du and Leung cleaned up all the shattered glass. A black curtain blew in the breeze as a makeshift cover, and behind the other glass door, a painted “Closed” sign sat propped on a chair.
Leung spoke about the last handful of days downtown compared to her previous experiences with protests and civil unrest, like the 2020 Black Lives Matter demonstrations: “This is bad, different,” she said. “It feels more violent. These people are so ballsy and brazen now.”
Du concurred. “We’ve never seen it like this before so close to home, right on our street,” he said. “A lot of these restaurants, our neighbors, had tent setups for outdoor dining, and protesters were turning them over to use as barricades. They used some as barriers and others they left burning.”
Leung said she plans to shut the store down until after what she described as riots subside — especially in consideration of this weekend’s expected “No kings” protests.

Demonstrators converge
Raul Gomez drivesup from Torrance every day and sells large flags for $20 a pop — Mexico, California, the U.S., El Salvador, Venezuela, Honduras, etc. He stood with his cart on a corner right across the street from the federal buildings. He’s sold around 200 flags per day.
“It’s been a little quiet today,” Gomez said on Wednesday afternoon. “I’ll pack up and move as soon as I see trouble. Most folks are out here to be peaceful. These are my people, mi gente. But you can see the other kind coming a mile away. They’re just here to start shit.”
Six Los Angeles Police Department officers stood casually around parked cars on the opposite corner. “They never bother me,” said Gomez.
Grace Martinez and her 16-year-old daughter, Raylene, stopped by Gomez’s stand on their way to the federal building. Grace wanted to buy a flag that is split diagonally down the middle — half American stars and stripes, half Mexican green, white and red.
“We came to support our people — immigrants,” said Grace, who drove downtown from her suburban home 40 miles away. “My father came here from Mexico years ago. If it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t be here. So I’m very thankful and blessed for that, and I want to defend the people that can’t defend themselves.” 
When asked how she feels about bricks being thrown at law enforcement and street vandalism all around the courthouse, Martinez said, “I’m a little nervous about it, but I’m trying to think positive that that’s not going to happen to us.”
Raylene said she’s ready. “Not everything’s gonna be peaceful. A lot of protests in L.A. from years and years ago weren’t all peaceful. Violence is never the answer, but violence gets more people to notice.”
She held a large “Who would Jesus deport?” sign she made herself.

Another demonstrator, J, didn’t want to give his full name. He’s been riding the Metro from South Los Angeles out to the downtown protest blocks with his 50/50 U.S./Mexico flag every day since Saturday. “The news — they kinda lie about everything, in my opinion,” said J. “There’s only like a few bad things that happen, but they make it like a big thing. We’re all being peaceful out here.”
With his flag draped over his shoulder, J bumped his fist against his chest as passing drivers honked their horns at him in support.
“The news makes it worse for us,” he said. “Respectfully, those guys over there and those guys down there,” he gestured toward LAPD officers grouped across the street and pointed at the National Guard soldiers farther down the block. “They make it worse for us.”

(Photo provided by ConocoPhillips)The multiagency group that coordinates oversight of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System needs an update to better operate in changing conditions, said a federal report released on Thursday.
The Joint Pipeline Office, a consortium of federal and state agencies with various regulatory duties, has scaled back its operations over the past several years, leading to possible gaps in oversight of the system that has delivered North Slope crude oil since 1977, said the report, issued by the Government Accountability Office, an independent nonpartisan agency that conducts audits and investigations for Congress.
To meet current conditions, the joint office should clarify its desired outcomes and resume what was once communication with the public about regulation, enforcement and other issues, the GAO report said.
“Redefining and documenting the intended outcomes of JPO’s oversight activities, including those aiming to inform the public of its oversight efforts, would enable JPO agencies to work toward shared goals and ensure accountability,” the report said. It is important to document the expectations, the report said. “Clarifying roles and responsibilities would enhance coordination among JPO agencies and help JPO identify any potential gaps in oversight.”
The GAO report was requested by U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.
The JPO, led by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Alaska Department of National Resources, was established in 1990 in response to the prior year’s Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster. The purpose was to better regulate the Trans Alaska Pipeline System, which comprises the 800-mile pipeline that carries crude oil from an intake station at Prudhoe Bay and the Valdez Marine Terminal, where the oil is loaded onto tankers.
Other agencies participating in the JPO are the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development.
Much has changed since the JPO’s startup, the GAO report points out.
North Slope oil production has dwindled. Pipeline throughput that averaged nearly 1.8 million barrels per day in 1990, close to the peak of 2 million barrels a day hit in 1988, is at an average daily flow of 482,495 barrels for the year to date, according to Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium that operates the system.
Lower oil volume affects Alyeska operations because the oil flowing through the line cools faster, moves slower and drops more solids, leading to more corrosion risks, the report noted.
Permafrost thaw, which undermines infrastructure through much of Alaska, has also affected the system’s integrity and prompted Alyeska to do some special maintenance and protective projects in slumping areas.
Alyeska in the early 2000s launched what it called a “strategic reconfiguration,” later renamed as “electrification and automation,” that increased automation, consolidated facilities — notably for pump stations along the 800-mile line and at the Valdez marine terminal — and relocated workers.
The agencies that are part of the JPO have also changed over time, with shifts in responsibilities and structure.
The JPO agencies continue to communicate with each other and continue to engage together in spill drills and other activities, the GAO report said. But since 2004, there has no longer been a common physical office, and JPO staffing has been reduced. The JPO no longer issues regular activity reports to the public; Its last Comprehensive Monitoring Program report was issued in 2007 and its last annual report in 2005, the GAO report said.
There are now concerns about oversight gaps, particularly at the Valdez terminal. The report cited one example of a troubling incident, the 2022 discovery of vapor leaks at 12 of the thermal’s 14 oil storage tanks. That event led to a report commissioned by the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council that criticized the safety culture at the terminal.
The GAO has issued other reports in the past about TAPS regulation and the JPO. A 1995 report lauded the joint office for improving oversight of the pipeline and terminal.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)A budget plan is taking shape and the clock is ticking.
Maine Morning Star will have regular updates as the committee tasked with setting that plan, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, takes straw votes on what to include ahead of a final vote on the budget proposal to be sent to the Maine Senate and House of Representatives for consideration.
Legislative leaders have said the intention is to complete all work by June 18, what had been the statutory adjournment date for the first regular session. Though, the Legislature is now in a special session, without a formal deadline.
In March, the Democratic majority pushed through a roughly $11.3 billion, two-year budget plan without Republican support and formally adjourned in order to start the clock for those funds to become available in 90 days. 
Senate Republicans refused to back an alternative short-term plan that would have immediately filled the current deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, because it did not include structural reform to the program.
The budget that did pass continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing one-time funding for MaineCare and other urgent needs. But it didn’t include any of the policy changes Gov. Janet Mills proposed, such as tax increases and program cuts, to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
These proposals and others from lawmakers are now being weighed by the appropriations committee as it crafts the next iteration of the budget.

Committee sets budget plan


By: Emma Davis - Saturday June 14, 2025 9:06 am


















In a party-line vote with Republicans opposed, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee set a budget plan just after 1 a.m. on Saturday, after convening for its final work session at 6:25 p.m. on Friday while the House was still in session. 
Some notable final actions included rejecting Gov. Janet Mills’ proposed cuts to low-income food assistance and upping ongoing funding for General Assistance, which helps municipalities pay for basic necessities for those who can’t afford them. 
Regarding health care, the committee added cost-of-living adjustments for direct care workers, though at lower than expected rates, as well as funding for family planning services, but also at a lower amount than providers say they need. 
Several bills currently pending were also worked into the budget plan, including proposals to alter the child tax credit and real estate transfer tax.
The budget bill now heads to the House of Representatives and Senate for approval. 
General Assistance
One of the last additions to the budget that the committee added early Saturday morning was increasing the baseline for General Assistance.
With an 8-4 vote, the committee added $2 million per year ongoing, $4 million in 2025-26 and back payments for 2023-24 to be distributed to municipalities based on their share of overall state reimbursement costs.
Republicans argued against the added spending, noting that most will go to Portland. The state’s most populous city receives the most funding for this program, disproportionate spending that the city’s elected leaders have argued is by design, given that most homeless shelters, and mental health and substance use treatment centers are located in or near Portland. 
“That’s not the way General Assistance is supposed to work,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said, noting that, for the most part, in order to get funds through the program you have to live in the municipality in which you’re receiving it. 
But that’s how it is working currently, said Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), who introduced this amendment.
Gattine said he’s heard a saying ever since he’s been involved in municipal government work that the General Assistance program is “a ticket to Portland.”
SNAP
The majority of the committee rejected Mills’ proposed reductions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. 
Maine is one of five states that provide a state-funded benefit to noncitizens not eligible for federally funded SNAP. Mills proposed eliminating what is referred to as the “Hardship D” exemption of the state program, which grants benefits for people who have received their work authorization but are unemployed.
Instead, the committee added $2.5 million for the program in each year of the biennium.  
“When we’re facing certain federal cuts in SNAP benefits to Mainers [and] we know that one in five children in the state goes to bed hungry every night, I can’t think of anything more critical than feeding Maine families,” Rep. Holly Stover (D-Boothbay) said. 
Health care
The committee included 1% cost-of-living adjustments, known as COLAs, for direct care workers for people on MaineCare who are due to receive rate adjustments starting in July, but this is not a fully funded COLA under the current statute. 
The Mills administration started withholding expected COLAs in January. The biennial budget passed in March back paid funding for a 1.95% increase, though more had been expected. 
“As we try to balance all the important things that we need to do, I don’t think we’re ever going to, I’m never going to walk out of here and feel that I’ve done enough,” Gattine said, adding that he hopes when lawmakers return in January for the second regular session that the Legislature can do more. 
Rep. Mark Blier (R-Buxton) pushed back on that, arguing, “If we really want to find the money to fund these people, we can find it,” however he also pledged, “Come January, let’s re-look at this. Let’s give these people the wage increases that they deserve and that we promised.”
However, the committee later rejected Mills’ proposal to restructure that rate setting, with members saying they didn’t fully understand it. Instead, that proposal is now expected to return as a department bill next year. 
Meanwhile, the committee further delayed — to the next Legislature — another health care-related initiative. It removed Mills’ proposal to decrease hospital reimbursement rates but then voted in those reductions starting after the 2027 fiscal year, essentially allowing it to return as an option when the next Legislature sets the biennium budget for 2028-29.
“So we’re making sure we’re taking care of the hospitals,” Fredette said, referring to this item, “but the direct care workers are taking it on the chin,” he added, referring to the COLAs.
The majority of the committee also voted to include a $3 million appropriation for family planning services, which include routine gynecological and well exams, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, birth control, cancer screenings, gender-affirming and behavioral health care, among others. Such funding is not used for abortions. 
This amount is half of what providers requested in a bill this year, which currently sits on the appropriations table.  
Bills
The committee included in the budget funding for a number of bills that had already passed both chambers but were awaiting funding. 
One was a bill sponsored by Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick), LD 1294, which would double the Dependent Exemption Tax Credit, Maine’s version of a child tax credit, for children under six years.
Another was a bill from Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford), LD 1082, to increase the real estate transfer tax on property valued at more than $1 million and requires 30% to be distributed to a new fund in the Maine State Housing Authority, which supports affordable housing.
While there is minimal cost associated with LD 1018, the committee opted to add the initiative to the budget. It prohibits discrimination by pharmaceutical manufacturers, health insurance carriers, pharmacy benefits managers and their agents against pharmacies and health care providers based on their participation in the federal 340B prescription drug discount program.
While most other initiatives were party-line votes, this addition was supported by one Republican, Rep. Jack Ducharme of Madison, who co-sponsored the bill. 
The committee also included funding to the Office of Aging and Disability Services for community-based services such as Meals on Wheels, essentially an initiative to help mitigate the fact that the Older Americans Act is no longer funded by the federal government. 
The committee also backed $3 million for each year of the next biennium to replace current and anticipated reductions in grants administered under the Victims of Crime Act. It also added certain mental health workers under the 1998 Special Plan for Retirement.

Adding streaming tax, upping cannabis tax and continuing free community college


By: Emma Davis - Thursday June 12, 2025 10:23 pm


















Returning on microphone after 9 p.m. Thursday night, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee voted to include several additional taxes proposed by Gov. Janet Mills in the budget, including a tax on streaming services and increasing the sales tax on cannabis. However, the committee included a smaller amount than the governor suggested to continue funding free community college. 
The committee voted 7-4 to include Mills’ proposed new 5.5% tax on streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. 
The committee also voted 8-4 to increase the sales tax on adult use cannabis from 10% to 14%, while reducing the cannabis excise tax rates by one-third. This was not a party-line vote. Rep. Kristen Cloutier (D-Lewiston), who co-chairs the Taxation Committee, said she was not in favor of this initiative.
“I’ve been in contact with some folks who are in the cannabis industry in my district and they have really advocated loudly against this,” Cloutier said. 
With these decisions made, the committee has now decided on what to include, and not include, out of Mills’ major tax proposals. 
In addition to the streaming and cannabis taxes, earlier Thursday the committee rolled back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes and increased the cigarette excise tax at an even higher amount than Mills requested. However, the committee rejected her suggested taxes on ambulances and pharmacies.
Most debate surrounded including funding to continue Maine’s Free College Scholarship, which the committee decided to fund but at a reduced amount. 
Rather than include the $12.5 million per year sought by the governor, the committee voted 9-3 to fund the program at $10 million per year through the next biennium. 
“We’ve had to make hard decisions about what we think we can afford, not afford, and we’re supportive but we believe that they’ll be able to address a need with $10 million a year,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.
However, to help guide decisions about continuing the program beyond that, the committee will be writing a letter to the community colleges requesting recommendations on eligibility requirements, out-of-state student funding, economy of scale and estimated future funding. 
“We had promised nights that would not be long,” committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said at 10:10 p.m. “We have just a little bit to finish up, but we will do that in the morning.” The committee is scheduled to reconvene at 9 a.m.

Budget gets bump from a “large and unusual” payment


By: Emma Davis -  5:33 pm


















The Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee announced Thursday afternoon the state has come into more cash that can be added to the budget. The additional funds are from some state agencies seeing unexpected surpluses this fiscal year. It also comes from two significant estate payments.
The majority of the committee moved all of this funding into the budget plan with 8-4 votes. 
Since the most recent revenue forecast in May, Maine received two “large and unusual” estate payments, Kirsten Figueroa, commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, told the appropriations committee Thursday afternoon. This now puts the estate tax line well above what was initially expected.
“Does that mean two people passed and this is where this money came from?” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) asked.
“I do,” Figueroa responded.  
The way this funding, $24 million, will be added to the budget is also unusual, because technically the money isn’t real until the fiscal year ends on June 30. But ultimately it will be used to pay for part of the $122 million in MaineCare funding for fiscal year 2027 that the committee voted into the budget on Wednesday. 
The majority of the committee also voted into the budget millions of dollars that various departments are not planning to use up by the end of the fiscal year. Among those funds are $4.5 million from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Behavioral Health and $5 million from the Office of Disability Services.
“I would rather keep the money in the account and have it be used for what it should be used for, rather than going to the general fund, which by going into the general fund, is essentially funding MaineCare,” Fredette said.

Committee saves money by rolling back funding for mental health programs, pensions


By: Emma Davis -  12:27 pm


















While not sticking to its stated start time, the appropriations committee returned Thursday morning to take more straw votes to work toward a complete budget plan. The committee plans to return throughout the day for more votes.
Mental health
Following the deadliest mass shooting in Maine history in 2023, the state put significant resources into bolstering mental health support. However, faced with the current deficit, the appropriations committee opted to reduce some of those programs.
On Tuesday, the committee approved funding for crisis receiving centers in Penobscot and Androscoggin counties but on Thursday voted out money for these centers in Kennebec and Aroostook counties.
In the supplemental budget last year, the governor signed into law funding to develop these crisis receiving centers following the Lewiston shooting. When presenting her two-year budget plan back in January, Mills argued it was not financially feasible to build all of the centers she had hoped. 
Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison raised concern about walking back on these commitments and said the centers were a point of rare bipartisan agreement last year, though the overall budget was passed mostly along party lines with Democrats in favor. 
“As someone who actually voted for the funding for this in the previous budget, this is a difficult cut for me to accept,” said committee co-chair Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook). 
Regarding Aroostook County in particular, Gattine said he spoke with the Department of Health and Human Services, whose representatives think that this specific model might not be the best for that rural area, so they may suggest an alternative crisis model in the future. 
The committee also removed funding for 24 mental health law enforcement liaisons to support mental health crisis intervention, and mobile response services.
The majority of the appropriations committee also voted to make cuts to various mental health services.
The committee voted 7-5 to provide county jails $4 million for medication assisted treatment to address drug dependency in fiscal year 2026, but did not include funding for the following year, which Gattine explained could be revisited in a supplemental budget next year. The committee also reduced funding for employee recruitment and retention of staff that provide medication management services within the Office of Behavioral Health.
Mills proposed a number of reductions to the overall state budget, focusing on new programs  that had not yet been fully started. While Gattine again reiterated the cuts are not something he takes lightly, he said, “I really came back to the fact that the baseline of MaineCare, everything that we have funded, provides millions and billions of dollars of support for behavioral health needs. I don’t think we support those needs enough. I’m hoping we can continue to do things to support the needs of people with behavioral health needs.”
Pensions 
Another area where the majority of the committee proposed to save money is rolling back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes.
The committee voted 8-5 to incorporate Mills’ proposal to phase-out a current deduction offered for nonmilitary pensions, though changed the thresholds. 
Mills proposed a phase-out beginning with income over $100,000 for individuals, $150,000 for heads of households and $200,000 for married individuals filing jointly. But the committee backed phase outs starting at $125,000 for individuals, $187,500 for heads of household, and $250,000 for joint filers. 
“The money that we’re taking belongs to them,” Rep. Mark Blier (R-Buxton) said in protest. “It doesn’t belong to us.”
Paid Family and Medical Leave 
The committee voted 7-5 to include funding the governor proposed to help cover the costs of the community college system, Maine Maritime Academy and the University of Maine System for the state-supported positions related to the new Paid Family and Medical Leave Program, which took effect on Jan. 1. 
However, the committee reduced the allocations Mills suggested for the university system, which Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, said it was because the system negotiated with a company that is allowing them to get premiums to cover some of the cost. 
Amid the voting, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) wanted to specify that this is one-time funding to cover the initial cost of the paid family leave program, after Republicans raised concerns about the state being on the hook. The committee ultimately incorporated that note.
“So you are going to take the lollipop away from the baby,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “I’m anxious to see that. Thank you.”
Additional decisions
The majority of the committee also approved an increase from $5 to $7 for fishing license fees. 
Also, following the request of the Legislative Council, which is made up of the ten elected members of leadership, the committee agreed to incorporate several temporary legislative positions, though did not go so far as to make them permanent.

Increased cigarette tax, rejected child care cuts, funded MaineCare


By: Emma Davis - Wednesday June 11, 2025 10:50 pm


















The budget took more of a shape Wednesday night, though, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said, “we are determined to get this budget done in the daylight,” so the committee is reconvening at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. 
Substantial decisions were made Wednesday night when the committee reconvened, including increasing Maine’s cigarette tax more than Gov. Janet Mills’ had proposed, rejecting Mills’ proposed cuts to child care worker stipends and Head Start, and adding funding for MaineCare. 
When Mills first proposed her budget in January, a key component she highlighted to address the deficit was her plan to raise revenue through a $1 increase in the cigarette excise tax — from $2 per pack to $3 — and corresponding increases to the excise tax on other tobacco-related products.
The majority of the appropriations committee voted 8-4 to increase it by $1.50.
Since Mills released her proposal, Republicans have been steadfast about their opposition to raising this tax, and to tax increases of any kind. On Wednesday those in the minority party on the committee again made that stance clear.
“I was shocked when the governor came out with the original proposed tax increase on the cigarettes of a buck,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said, “and now to throw it up to a buck and a half. I see in my opinion, with all due respect to everyone around this horseshoe, a lack of ability to make tough decisions on where we’re going to spend money in this state.”
When Mills presented her proposal back in January, she touted it as a way to help generate revenue while simultaneously reducing public health costs in the long-term by disincentivizing people to smoke. Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln) highlighted that goal in voicing her support for upping the tax, stating that her stepfather recently died of cancer caused by cigarettes.
But Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester) countered, “I don’t feel like it’s responsible to base our budget on revenue that we hope will go down.”
The majority of the committee, voting 7-5, subsequently approved about $122 million for MaineCare, filling a gap left in the initial two-year budget passed in March that did not include MaineCare funding for the second year of the biennium. 
“I do believe we should pay our bills, but we also had reforms to hopefully reduce that amount that we’re paying,” Arata said, referring to proposals to implement work requirements and other reforms to the program that failed to be included in the supplemental budget for the current fiscal year. “Therefore, I can’t support this motion.”  
The majority almost entirely rejected the governor’s proposed cuts related to child care programs, with one exception. 
Voting 7-5 again, the committee removed from the budget plan Mills’ proposal to reverse the state’s recent investments in child care by reducing worker stipends by $30 million to bring them back to 2022 levels. With the same vote breakdown, the committee also rejected Mills’ proposal to cut funding for Head Start by $7 million. 
That same majority also rejected a proposed $2.5 million cut in fiscal year 2026 to the child care employment award program, which includes child care staff in the Maine Child Care affordability program, however the committee chose to remove funding for the award program in 2027. 
“This was styled as a two-year pilot program, so our intent is to continue the pilot program in 2026, not provide funding for it in fiscal year 2027 at this time,” said Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “We’ll have a chance to evaluate that next year when we reconvene.”  
Although a budget-neutral move, one decision Wednesday night received praise from Republicans. 
Mills proposed elevating the current Governor’s Energy Office to a cabinet-level department in her budget plan but the committee removed that change Wednesday, in light of a separate bill moving through the Legislature that seeks to do that. 
“I appreciate the fact that we are letting this kind of an initiative be debated as it should be in the policy committees and brought to the floor for a vote,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison.

Preserving Maine State Grant Program


By: Emma Davis -  3:58 pm


















Wednesday morning the appropriations committee made a number of reductions to the governor’s proposed funding for various departments. Returning briefly just after 3 p.m., the majority of its members chose to again reject a proposal from Mills, following requests from private higher education institutions. 
Currently, all Maine public and private universities, colleges and technical schools that administer federal financial aid, such as the Pell Grant and Direct Loans, are eligible for something called the Maine State Grant Program, which provides need-based assistance.
The governor proposed cutting Maine’s private colleges from the program, which educators and students pushed back on during the public hearing. The Education and Cultural Affairs Committee also requested the change be rejected. The appropriations committee followed suit Wednesday voting the change out of the plan 8-2. 
“Stay tuned,” appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said after the afternoon votes. “We will be back later. I’m not quite sure when but we will be back.”

Mobile home program funded while judiciary requests pared down


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 10, 2025 6:50 pm


















Indicative of the lack of sleep and long hours legislators are working, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) accidentally called a vote as unanimous as the committee met while the Senate was still in session Tuesday afternoon. 
The mishap was met with laughs as it was bookended by votes on a number of items — none of which were unanimous. 
The majority of the committee backed one-time funding — a transfer of $3 million from the unappropriated surplus of the general fund to the Maine State Housing Authority — for the manufactured and mobile home park preservation and assistance program. This was a request in a bill that passed the chambers but was placed on the appropriations table. 
There are currently more than 100 bills on this table, which is managed by the appropriations committee. Bills that cost money that hasn’t already been allocated are placed here to vie for remaining unappropriated funding — or, as evidenced by this case, could instead be included in the budget plan. 
After the committee sets the budget, one of its final acts will be to “run the table” and decide which of the remaining bills will receive funds.
Other items added into the plan include one-time funding to upgrade courtrooms with video conferencing technology. However, the committee also moved out numerous other proposals related to the judiciary, such as funding for new positions, resources and ​​increasing the number of jurors called to jury duty.
“I think we’re shortchanging the judiciary,” said Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport). 
Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee, said he believed many of the items the committee ultimately voted out were important. 
“I think by the time we’re done here, there will be over $20 million in new funding approved for them, and I hope the process is that they’re able to come back and we’re able to do more for them over time,” Gattine said.

A move to maximize federal match for free school meals


By: Emma Davis -  11:34 am


















Amid chamber work Tuesday morning, the majority of the Appropriations Committee voted in favor of a change aimed to maximize federal dollars for free school lunches in order to save the state an expected $2 million. 
After the COVID-19 pandemic, Maine became one of a handful of states to pass legislation making school meals free.
“[That] took away that stigma and took away that paperwork that was associated with individual families and individual students, so now everybody in the school district does qualify,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. “But we do have some school districts that have not enrolled in the program, so we’re not able to maximize the federal funding that’s available.”
After the committee voted to pay the difference between the federal reimbursement and full price of meals for schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program, Brennan introduced an amendment to require that in order for schools to get this state funding they must first enroll in the free meal program in a way that makes them eligible for the maximum money available at the federal level. The committee approved the change with a 9-2 straw vote. 
Much of the committee’s work has been approving, or rejecting, a number of state government positions. Republicans have continued to raise objections to expanding state government personnel. 
“I think one thing we can agree on is that it’s all a balance,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “And, maybe we balance things in different places, but finding the right balance is part of what this is all about.”

Another of Gov. Mills’ proposed taxes removed from plan


By: Emma Davis - Monday June 9, 2025 4:53 pm


















Monday morning at the State House began with more talk about taxes as the Appropriations Committee continued its line-by-lines votes on what to include in the budget. 
The majority of the committee voted to remove Mills’ proposed tax on ambulance services, which is one of several tax increases the governor proposed as a means to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
The tax on non-municipal ambulance service providers would have been equal to 6% of their net operating revenue, which the Mills administration said it would have used to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements.
While Republicans on the committee said they supported removing the tax — as the minority party has made clear it will not support tax increases of any kind — they questioned how the state will deal with those shortfalls and pay for additional spending the committee has approved. 
One example from Monday was reallocating the cost of an emergency coordinator position that is partially funded through federal expenditures to being completely supported by the general fund. 
“We’re moving positions and costs into the general fund, and my only question is, where is that money coming from?” Sen. Sue Bernard (R-Aroostook) asked. “Is it coming from more tax increases? Is it coming from cutting other programs that we haven’t gotten to yet, or what?”
Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin), who co-chairs the committee, responded, “As we build this budget, we will take care of that in one way or another so that the budget will balance at the end.” 
It is not yet clear whether the committee will support some of Mills’ other proposed taxes or the cuts she proposed to health and child care programs. So far, the committee also voted out a proposed pharmacy tax. 
Implications from federal funding cuts were also top of mind. 
The coordinator position was one of several that the committee readjusted to be more reliant on state funding, though Mills made those recommendations before President Donald Trump’s administration began rescinding congressionally appropriated funds. 
“We have talked about the fact that if federal funds disappear, positions disappear,” Rotundo said. 
But some concerns about federal funding predated Trump’s second term. During the public hearing for the budget bill, the Maine Emergency Management Agency said budget deficits related to federal funding had already resulted in the agency leaving two positions vacant. 
The committee voted to fund two positions fully with the general fund, after they’d previously been supported solely by federal dollars. 
“It was important to make sure that these positions were preserved and that it was worth the investment in additional general fund dollars,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), the other co-chair of the committee.

With less than two weeks left, lawmakers still debating budget plan


By: Emma Davis -  4:51 pm


















During the committee’s last meeting on Thursday, the majority of its members rejected a tax on Maine pharmacies the governor had proposed, while voting in favor of additional funding and rate reform for nursing homes. 
The pharmacy tax would have imposed a 70-cent tax on every outpatient prescription filled by Maine pharmacies, the revenue from which the Mills administration said it would use to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements. 
“I haven’t voted for any items,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison on Thursday. “Yet, this will be my first, because I believe that we already collect too much taxes.” 
With a 10-2 vote, other Republicans backed removing the tax too, though the holdouts noted that their opposition was because of a lack of clarity about the overall budget plan. 
“I applaud the work of the majority in terms of removing this,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “However, I will be consistent in reviewing the overall global budget in determining whether or not I will support it.” 
That sentiment was also shared ahead of the committee voting 9-3 in favor of $20 million in additional funding for nursing homes over the biennium. This includes a $6.5 million investment for rate reform to support the direct care workforce and incentivize permanent staff, which would in turn unlock $12.2 million in funding from the federal government. 
“Nursing home rate reform is very important to us, however at this particular time we have not had a discussion about where additional general funds come from that we’re going to need,” Ducharme said. “In order for me to support this, even though I would historically support something like this, I want to know where the money’s coming from.”
Other Republicans had a different take. While Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata of New Gloucester would also like to know where the funds are coming from, “I feel right about supporting this,” she said. “I might not support the entire package, but I feel better knowing that this is in there, ultimately.”

Photo contributed by Chattahoochee RiverkeeperThe U.S. Geological Survey’s South Atlantic Water Science Center in Norcross will remain open following backlash over the Department of Government Efficiency’s proposal to terminate the lease.
The U.S. Department of the Interior announced this week that the center will not have its lease terminated in order to continue critical water quality testing along the Chattahoochee River, which supplies drinking water to millions of Georgians.
Interior Acting Assistant Secretary Tyler Hassen sent letters this week informing the Georgia U.S. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of the decision. Earlier this year, the Elon Musk-led DOGE listed the property among 164 Interior buildings and offices under consideration for closure as part of its campaign to reduce government spending. The DOGE website previously projected the federal government would save $1.3 million by not renewing the lease for the Norcross center.
This spring, Warnock and Ossoff urged the feds not to eliminate vital work that includes monitoring E. coli bacteria and flood levels throughout Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
“In some cases, the department took action to reverse a termination due to the critical nature of the mission, unavailability of alternative, cost-effective solutions, or the specialized nature of the facility,” Hassen wrote. “You will be pleased to know that the GSA rescinded the termination of the USGS lease in Norcross, Georgia.”
Hassen, a former Texas oil executive, served on Musk’s DOGE team and is awaiting Senate confirmation for his new role with the Department of the Interior.
For several years, the Norcross water science center has worked with Chattahoochee Riverkeeper on the BacteriALERT program, which provides live updates to the public of the amount of E. coli contamination in the river.
“Chattahoochee Riverkeeper is pleased that the Department of the Interior has reversed the termination of the lease for the USGS South Atlantic Water Science Center,” Chattahoochee Riverkeeper Jason Ulseth said Friday. “We thank Senators Ossoff and Warnock for their leadership and are grateful for their work to ensure this vital resource remains in place for all who depend on it.”

SPARTAN 151 RIG, COOK INLET — Deep below the ocean floor outside Anchorage this spring, a huge drill bit chewed through multi-million-year-old sandstone, sending crushed bits of rock back to the surface through a mile-long hole.
The hunt for natural gas, to keep Alaska warm, had resumed.
Here, on crowded platforms perched above the icy waters of Cook Inlet, a small army labors to keep up the extraction of fossil fuels from Alaska’s oldest producing oil and gas basin. After a half-century of extraction, the gas is still there. But it’s gotten harder and costlier to produce — and fewer companies are participating in the search.
Just one large mobile drilling rig, the Spartan 151, still works offshore in Cook Inlet. This week, its five-dozen workers were hustling to finish two new wells for a small oil and gas firm, Furie.

	They’re well-paid and well-fed, with cooks dishing out ample servings of gumbo and fish tacos. On sunny days, they can gaze off the rig at the snow-blanketed volcanoes that ring the Inlet. 
But the pressure is on: Urban Alaska’s utilities, some of which have warned of the potential for rolling blackouts amid a gas supply crunch, are counting on Furie’s production. 
“I’m scared to death every day,” said Michael Duncan, Furie’s drilling manager. “It’s like, ‘We’ve got to get this.’”

	Furie’s drilling effort this year is as close to a glimmer of hope as you’ll find in Cook Inlet these days. But it also underscores the challenges that continue to plague operators there. 
Purchased out of bankruptcy five years ago by an Anchorage oil and gas veteran, John Hendrix, Furie is budgeting $38 million to drill its wells this spring — cash that will help keep the Kenai Peninsula’s shrinking oil and gas service industry at work.
But before sinking its drill bit into the seabed, Furie needed help from Alaska’s government. One agency granted it a steep reduction in the 12.5% share of its gas production that the company would otherwise be required to give to the state; another agency approved $50 million in loans.
And earlier this spring, Anchorage’s electric utility and a pipeline company jointly announced a project that could create new competition for Furie: a facility that could receive huge quantities of liquefied natural gas shipped into Alaska from afar. Ironically, the project would convert a Kenai Peninsula facility used during Cook Inlet’s boom days to export excess gas to Asia — repurposing it to handle imports from Canada or the Gulf of Mexico.
Urban Alaska’s electric utilities say that importing LNG appears to be the only way for them to ensure firm supplies of gas for years to come, given the risk, uncertainty and cost that comes with drilling in declining basins like Cook Inlet.
The appeal of a consistent supply of hydrocarbons from global commodities markets is undeniable for locally elected utility boards charged with producing electricity for members at the lowest price. But that argument doesn’t resonate with some of the hardworking hands on the Spartan, and at Furie’s gas handling facility on shore.

	Imported LNG “does no good for the state, and now we’re not energy independent any more,” said Furie Operations Superintendent Ben Christianson, 35, who grew up on the Kenai Peninsula and has watched its oil and gas industry shrink as he’s built his career in it. 
Producing gas locally, Christianson said, “is good for Alaskans.” Furie employs some 20 people, 90% of whom are residents, according to Hendrix, the owner; the company’s hard hats sport a label: “Home grown energy.”
A declining basin
Furie this week allowed me to visit its offshore platform and witness its spring drilling campaign — which showed how a storied Alaska industry is hanging on in Cook Inlet, while also illustrating the challenge of producing fossil fuels from the increasingly depleted basin.
Production in Cook Inlet began in the 1950s and peaked in the 1970s, when the industry extracted more than 200,000 barrels of oil a day — more than 1% of America’s consumption at the time. Some of the oil was produced from onshore fields, but companies also sunk more than a dozen offshore platforms in the Inlet, which had to be reinforced against huge tides and winter ice floes.
 

  The Monopod platform was built in Washington state during the 1960s for oil companies Marathon and Unocal. It then had to be floated down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean and nearly 2,000 miles to Alaska. Once in Cook Inlet, its pontoons were flooded and it was sunk into place.

	Today, six of those platforms are shuttered, and daily Cook Inlet oil production has fallen below 10,000 barrels, according to state data. Much of the industry’s investment flows instead to Alaska’s North Slope, where companies have discovered huge new fields and are spending billions to develop them.
 
This oil platform stopped pumping 30 years ago. Alaska still won’t make the owner tear it down.

	In Cook Inlet, work is now centered largely on extracting natural gas, which is sold to urban Alaska utilities for power generation and also used by residents and businesses for heating. Vacant, dilapidated buildings line the Kenai Spur Highway, where many of the remaining Cook Inlet oil field supply and service companies have offices and warehouses. The former gas export facility sits shuttered, as does a huge manufacturing plant that once produced fertilizer from natural gas.
“I believe Alaskans have given up on Cook Inlet,” said Hendrix, 67, the Furie owner, who grew up on the Kenai Peninsula and remembers it “just bustling” with oil and gas activity.

	All the contracting companies, Hendrix said, “went to the North Slope.”
Interest in Cook Inlet has waned, in part, because of the small size of urban Alaska’s market: Companies say that even if they found a huge new gas field, they wouldn’t have customers to buy up all of their production.
The oil industry’s decline in the Inlet has forced Hendrix into a partnership with a competing firm that now controls the vast majority of the basin’s production: Hilcorp, a privately owned business co-founded by Texas billionaire Jeff Hildebrand.
The helicopter that Furie used this week to get out to its single offshore Cook Inlet platform? Operated by a Hilcorp affiliate, which uses the aircraft to access Hilcorp’s 15 different platforms. The huge dock that, during the winter, hosts the rig Furie is using to drill its wells? Also a Hilcorp property.
The rig itself? It’s owned by Hilcorp, too; Furie is paying hefty sums to rent it, and it has to be returned soon so that Hilcorp can drill wells from its own offshore platforms in the Inlet later this year. 
“They’ve made everything available. They’re working with us,” Hendrix said of Hilcorp. “They want us to succeed.”

	If Furie’s spring drilling takes longer than expected, though, it could cost the company $2 million to keep the Spartan rig for the additional time, according to Hendrix. That’s in part because the tugboats required to move it are only available on certain days, as they’re also needed in Anchorage to help maneuver the cargo ships that bring in the city’s food supply.
In a prepared statement, Hilcorp said it’s pleased to see the Spartan rig “hard at work in Cook Inlet this summer, supporting efforts to ensure a stable and reliable gas supply” for urban Alaska. The company says it charges Furie the same price to use the rig as Hilcorp charges itself internally.
“We wish Furie great successes as they wrap up their current drilling operations, and we look forward to deploying the Spartan 151 to our own platforms later this summer,” said Hilcorp spokesman Matt Shuckerow.
Tight real estate
Getting to the Spartan drilling rig is a 12-minute helicopter ride, with all passengers required to don drysuits and lifejackets that could keep them alive in the event of a crash into the water.
Flying out with a Furie official Tuesday were two representatives of their biggest customer, the natural gas utility Enstar, including President John Sims. It was Sims’ first trip offshore, and seeing the huge stacks of pipe and other equipment in such a remote setting made an impression.
“When I walked out and just saw that stuff, it’s like ‘holy cow’ — an interruption in operations out there means they’re now trying to bring down equipment from the North Slope, which they have to put on a boat,” Sims said a day later. “You appreciate the cost that they have on a daily basis to try to make gas flow to our system.”

	Furie’s drilling operation involves two separate pieces of expensive infrastructure that are temporarily linked for the project, each with their own crew.
One is Furie’s gas production platform, the Julius R — a smaller, single-legged structure that’s permanently placed in the Inlet’s waters.



The other is Hilcorp’s hulking, four-legged, Spartan drilling rig, a mobile platform with its own cafeteria and living quarters. Earlier this spring, the Spartan was floated out from a dock and fixed above the Julius R — an intricate operation that involves tugboats pushing it into place.
The helicopter carrying the visitors this week landed gently on a pad extending out over the ocean from the Spartan. Some 60 people, working three-week shifts, staff the rig — dwarfing the handful of Furie employees that staff the Julius R.

	The Spartan was originally shipped to Cook Inlet from the Gulf Coast years ago, and it still employs many of the same workers. While some are Alaska residents, it’s rare to find one without a Texas or Louisiana accent.
“These are good people, taking care of each other,” said Duncan, Furie’s drilling manager. “We’re in the middle of the ocean.”
Drilling an oil well from an offshore rig involves representatives from multiple companies, choreographing the movement of enormous quantities of steel on a worksite where space is at a premium. The Spartan’s drill bit descends through its own deck, then passes through slots on the Julius R below before sinking into rock; Duncan says the experts guiding the drill bit could hit your car if you buried it a mile deep and half a mile out.

	One of the big challenges on Cook Inlet’s offshore platforms is finding space for new wells. It’s an extremely tight fit for all of the necessary exploration and production infrastructure — not to mention equipment upgrades that could help boost flow rates into the Julius R’s 15-mile pipeline to shore, if only there was room to install them.
“It’s like, ‘You can’t do that — where are you going to put it?’” said Christianson, Furie’s operations superintendent. “There are all these different challenges and struggles that we have with real estate.”
‘You gotta hope’
As of this week, the Spartan had finished drilling to the bottom of its two new wells — the most sensitive and expensive part of the operation. But there were still more steps left before the rig’s job was done, and on Tuesday, mud-spattered workers on the floor of the Spartan helped maneuver lengths of pipe and other equipment.
“We don’t measure in pounds. It’s, really, tons that we’re lifting here in the air,” Duncan said. “It’s a really critical operation — these guys pay very close attention to what’s happening.”



Finishing new wells is a weekslong process; Furie hopes to wrap up and move the Spartan off the Julius R before the end of the month.
But Hendrix, who said he’s invested at least $13 million of his own cash in this year’s drilling program, won’t know if his efforts will pay off until a couple of weeks later. That’s when Furie will blast holes into the sides of the well — a step known as perforation that should, finally, start the natural gas flowing.
“Until we perforate it, we don’t know,” Hendrix said. “You gotta hope.”
The customers who burn the gas from Hendrix’s company will end up paying significantly more than historical prices in Cook Inlet. Enstar, under a new contract recently approved by state regulators, is paying nearly $13 per thousand cubic feet of Furie’s gas. 
 

  The gas from Furie’s offshore production platform comes ashore at the company’s Kenai Peninsula processing facility, where the fuel is stripped of water. (Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)
 

	That’s some 50% higher than the roughly $8 it pays under its contract with Hilcorp — which was inked before the gas shortage arrived.
In past contract negotiations, Enstar pushed suppliers hard “to get the lowest cost with the most reliability for our customers,” said Sims, the company’s president. In retrospect, he added, Enstar may have pushed too hard, negotiating provisions that hurt producers — like Furie under its past, pre-bankruptcy ownership — when they ran into problems and couldn’t deliver promised gas.
“When you think about that risk and that massive expense of drilling — the market’s changing, and I think people are becoming more aware that this is dangerous for a company, and we can’t put all the risk just on the producer,” Sims said, pointing to the need for the state-sponsored loan to Furie.

	In the meantime, the work continues. On the Spartan, crews are staffing round-the-clock shifts to finish up Furie’s wells before moving on to Hilcorp projects. 
Hendrix, who once served as an oil and gas advisor to former Gov. Bill Walker, recalled his old boss’ description of the industry as Alaska’s “silent economy” — largely invisible to those who don’t work in it.
“If this was in downtown Anchorage and someone was spending $38 million, everyone would know about it,” he said. “But hopefully, everything will work out, and we’ll get our gas.”

The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party organized a one-mile silent march, starting at Morning Star Baptist Church and ending at the Mississippi Capitol, where lawmakers were contemplating changes in voting laws. 
Jackson police arrested the marchers, more than half of them students from Lanier High School. Over the next few weeks, more than 1,000 were arrested and held in livestock pens at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds. 
During the protest, 5-year-old Anthony Quin waved a U.S. flag outside the Governor’s Mansion. Matt Herron’s photograph of state trooper Huey Krohn trying to wrestle the flag from Quin’s hands ran in The New York Times and other newspapers across the U.S. Quin later said that his mother had told him to hold onto that flag for dear life — and he did. 
On June 30, a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the release of those arrested and barred the city of Jackson from making any further arrests. 
Despite Quin’s young age, this wasn’t his first brush with the civil rights movement. A month before this photo was taken, his family’s home was firebombed in McComb because of their work in the movement. He and his sisters went on to become the first students to integrate McComb public schools. 
From those days of fighting racism on a day-by-day basis, Quin learned to care for students. He became a principal of several different elementary schools before becoming an administrator over the schools.

(Photo courtesy of Visit Fargo-Moorhead)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”













Now they’ve seen measles in their community so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’


– Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas





In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
 Outbreak moves north

In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”

Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
 ‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas

According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 6, there are 1,168 confirmed cases affecting 33 states. Texas reported two more cases June 10, and Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 17 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Getty image)Each June, we pause to celebrate fathers. We share cards, fire up the grill, and scroll through social media posts honoring fathers near and far. But when the smoke clears and Monday rolls around, how often do we stop to ask: What do fathers really need to thrive — and are we, as a community, truly supporting them?
For too long, the story of fatherhood has been told in extremes — either lionized as stoic protectors or vilified in the absence. What’s missing is the middle: the everyday father who’s trying, stumbling, learning, and growing. The father who wants to break harmful and oftentimes generational patterns, to love better, to be present. The father who — like all of us — needs support, not judgment.
We often say it takes a village to raise a child. But let’s be honest — most of that village has been built around motherhood. Parent groups, baby showers, parenting blogs — these are cultural scaffolds that help mothers feel seen, heard, and supported. And they should. But where is that scaffolding for fathers?
Nationwide, fewer than 1 in 5 community-based parenting programs are designed specifically with fathers in mind. The gap is even wider when it comes to programs that address fatherhood in the context of trauma, domestic conflict, or behavioral health/conflict resolution. And yet, engaged fathers are linked to better outcomes in nearly every measure of child development — from higher school achievement to lower rates of incarceration, mental illness, and substance use.
Too many fathers — especially those who have made mistakes — are navigating parenthood without a map or a hand to hold. They face shame, isolation, and often don’t have a safe space to reflect, grow, or reconnect with their children.










Parent groups, baby showers, parenting blogs — these are cultural scaffolds that help mothers feel seen, heard, and supported. And they should. But where is that scaffolding for fathers?


One example of what’s possible when we invest in fathers is the Family Service of Rhode Island program, Caring Dads. The 17-week program doesn’t just teach parenting skills — it fosters self-awareness, empathy, and accountability. Participants learn how their actions have impacted their families and are equipped with practical strategies to build healthy, child-centered relationships. This isn’t about excusing harm — it’s about transforming it. Each cohort is supported with group sessions, individual check-ins, and connection to foster community services. Mothers are also engaged in parallel, ensuring transparency and safety. In many cases, fathers in the program are able to reestablish trust, increase positive communication and create more stable environments for their children.
We know from decades of research that children do better when both parents are positively engaged. Yet our systems often write off fathers too quickly — especially Black and Brown fathers, who are twice as likely to be in the child welfare system and face greater barriers to reunification. If we are serious about equity, we must dismantle the narrative that fatherhood is expendable. We must challenge ourselves to ask: How are we making space for dads to show up — messy, honest, and human?
Supporting fathers isn’t just a feel-good gesture for Father’s Day. It’s a year-round commitment to community well-being. When we support fathers, we interrupt cycles of trauma, and longstanding stereotypes that impact fathers ability to be present and engage,  strengthen families, and create safer, more nurturing environments for children to grow.
This Father’s Day, let’s expand our idea of celebration. Let’s reach out — not just with praise, but with partnership. Let’s build father-friendly spaces. Let’s ask dads what they need, and listen with compassion.
Because when fathers thrive, families heal. And when we embrace dads as a vital part of the village, everyone wins.

In the suit, Attorney General Dana Nessel alleges Tribar Technologies Inc. and Adept Plastic Finishing Inc. had violated the Michigan Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act on multiple occasions, including Tribar’s 2022 discharge of toxic hexavalent chromium into the Huron River through Wixom’s Wastewater Treatment Plant.
The suit further alleges the companies failed to comply with permitting requirements, and repeatedly violated water and air pollution standards.

While the two companies have since closed their Wixom facilities, Nessel’s suit argues stormwater laden with PFOS, another contaminant, continues to discharge from the two sites.
“Michigan’s environmental laws exist to protect the air we breathe and the water we use from toxic chemicals,” Nessel said in a statement. “When companies cut corners or violate these protections, my office will use every tool available to hold them accountable and ensure proper cleanup and compliance.”
Alongside civil penalties, Nessel aims to require the companies to clean up the contamination. She is also seeking penalties under the Michigan Business Corporation Act, arguing Tribar lacks the necessary certificate of authority to operate in Michigan.

Pregnant patients and their infants are vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. In the letter to payers and insurance companies released this week, ACOG stressed the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations and how they protect babies and pregnant people. It was signed by prominent professional groups including the American College of Physicians, Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Public Health Association.
The letter follows U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy children and healthy pregnant patients, sidestepping an established decision process by scientists. Kennedy, who has made false claims questioning vaccine safety, earlier this week fired all 17 experts on the federal vaccine advisory committee panel, replacing them with eight new members, four of whom have spoken out against vaccines.
The Trump administration’s moves have alarmed health experts, who worry about coverage and access to the shot amid the agency’s dismissal of science.
“We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” the letter reads. “Given the historic gaps in research, investment, and support for women’s health, it is essential that all aspects of obstetric and gynecologic care — including COVID-19 vaccination — be grounded in the best available scientific evidence.
Studies have shown babies born following a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have a higher risk of low birth weights, stillbirth and respiratory distress, and data demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
Pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are also at higher risk of complications such as blood clots, are more likely to be hospitalized in intensive care units or to need ventilators, and are at a higher risk of death, the letter notes.
Payers should make the vaccine available to “pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” the letter reads. Without insurance, a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 shot can cost roughly $140 for adults.
Following the recommendation rollback, public health officials in some states have emphasized their support of COVID-19 vaccines.
The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, for example, said it “continues to recommend the current COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older,” noting that newborns “depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection.” Wisconsin Medicaid will also continue to cover the shot, the department said in a media release.
Officials in Georgia also said they expect continued coverage of the shot.
In Washington, a spokesperson for the state health agency told local media that the department is advising pregnant people to speak with their provider “to determine if receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is best for them.”
During this year’s legislative sessions, at least seven states introduced legislation aiming to ban or limit mRNA vaccines. Instead of using a weakened or dead version of the actual virus to stimulate an immune response, mRNA vaccines use a genetic code created in a laboratory to tell the body’s cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology.
“The COVID vaccines were a remarkable scientific accomplishment, and they remain the best tool that we have to prevent severe outcomes associated with COVID infection,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, ACOG president, wrote in a statement. “Ob-gyns know that COVID infection during pregnancy can be incredibly dangerous for our pregnant patients — and we know that the vaccine can protect both them and their infants after birth.”
When patients are “forced to pay out of pocket, or to cover high cost sharing,” he wrote, “they are less likely to be able to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)On a summer night in 2023, an explosion at one of Louisiana’s biggest petrochemical complexes sent a plume of fire into the sky. More explosions followed as poison gas spewed from damaged tanks at the Dow chemical plant, triggering a shelter-in-place order for anyone within a half mile of the facility, which sprawls across more than 830 acres near Baton Rouge.
For more than a year, a little-known government agency has been investigating the incident. But the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board will likely shut down before completing its probes of the Dow explosion and other such incidents across the country. President Donald Trump’s administration has quietly proposed shutting down the board, an independent federal agency charged with uncovering the causes of large-scale chemical accidents.
Near the end of a 1,224-page budget document released with little fanfare on May 30, White House officials said shutting down the agency, commonly called the CSB, will help “move the nation toward fiscal responsibility” as the Trump administration works to “redefine the proper role of the federal government.” The CSB’s $14 million annual budget would be zeroed out for the 2026 fiscal year and its emergency fund of $844,000 would be earmarked for closure-related costs. The process of shutting the agency down is set to begin this year, according to CSB documents.
Eliminating the CSB will come at a cost to the safety of plant workers and neighboring communities, especially along the Gulf Coast, where the bulk of the U.S. petrochemical industry is concentrated, said former CSB officials and environmental groups.
“Closing the CSB will mean more accidents at chemical plants, more explosions and more deaths,” said Beth Rosenberg, a public health expert who served on the CSB board from 2013 to 2014.
“This shows that the Trump administration does not care about frontline communities already burdened with this industry,” said Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project, an environmental justice group in Lake Charles. “We’re the ones who have to shelter in place or evacuate whenever there’s an explosion or (chemical) release, and now there will be less oversight when these things happen.”
The CSB did not respond to a request for comment.
The proposed closure of the CSB follows several other moves by the Trump administration to slash staffing levels at the Environmental Protection Agency and ease federal health and safety regulations.
Founded in 1998, the CSB investigates the causes of petrochemical accidents and issues recommendations to plants, regulators and business groups. The CSB doesn’t impose fines or penalties, instead relying on voluntary compliance or on enforcement by other agencies, such as the EPA, to mandate safety improvements.
Of the more than 100 investigations the CSB has conducted, Texas leads the country with 22 cases, followed by Louisiana with eight.
“Those numbers tell us that Louisiana and Texas really need the Chemical Safety Board, and there will certainly be negative impacts here if it closes down,” said Wilma Subra, an environmental scientist with the Louisiana Environmental Action Network.
Along with the Dow chemical explosion, the agency has four other active investigations of incidents in Texas, Kentucky, Georgia and Virginia. CSB investigations often take several months to complete.



In an update of the Dow explosion investigation last year, the CSB hinted at “several events of concern” at the chemical complex between Baton Rouge and the town of Plaquemine – an area that forms part of the industrial corridor known as “Cancer Alley.” Among the targets of the investigation were at least two mechanical problems, multiple smaller explosions after the initial blow-up, and the release of more than 30,000 pounds of ethylene oxide, a colorless gas the agency noted is a cancer-causing substance.
The CSB’s last completed investigation was focused on a fatal 2024 explosion at a liquid nitriding facility in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The CSB identified several safety failures and at least three other dangerous incidents involving similar hazards at other facilities owned by the same company, HEF Groupe of France.
HEF “failed to ensure that information about those incidents and lessons learned from them were shared and implemented organization-wide,” the CSB investigation, released early this month, found.
A chain reaction of mishaps at the Chattanooga facility resulted in an eruption of “hot molten salt” that killed a worker, according to the investigation.
On average, hazardous chemical accidents happen once every other day in the U.S., according to Coming Clean, an environmental health nonprofit. Coming Clean documented 825 fires, leaks and other chemical-related incidents between January 2021 and October 2023. The incidents killed at least 43 people and triggered evacuation orders and advisories in nearly 200 communities.
Trump called for the CSB’s closure during his first term but settled for leaving many investigator and agency leadership positions unfilled. Slowing the agency’s work resulted in a backlog of 14 unfinished investigations by the time Joe Biden took office in 2021.
Under the first Trump administration, investigations were hampered by staffing shortages and months-long conflicts between the board and the agency’s Trump-appointed director, according to a federal inspector’s report.
In the new budget proposal, the Trump administration indicated the CSB’s duties could be handled by other agencies.
“The CSB duplicates substantial capabilities in the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to investigate chemical-related mishaps,” a CSB budget proposal said. “This function should reside within agencies that have authorities to issue regulations…”
This justification is “a lie,” said Jordan Barab, a former deputy assistant secretary of OSHA and a former CSB recommendations manager.
While OSHA and the EPA are limited to assessing specific violations of their existing standards and regulations, the CSB can look far more broadly and at the “deeper causes” of accidents, including worker fatigue, corporate budget cuts and lax oversight, Barab said.
Even when other federal agencies appeared to ignore CSB recommendations, community groups and local governments could cite them when pushing for improved safety standards, Ozane said.
“It was scientific evidence we could all use to pressure the state or the federal regulators to do something about pollution and safety in the places we live,” she said. “This is just another tool and another resource that’s been taken away from us.”

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13 before Abrego Garcia’s arraignment on federal charges. (Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation to an El Salvador prison sparked national debate over Trump administration immigration crackdowns, entered not guilty pleas on Friday to two federal human smuggling charges.
Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and seated next to attorneys with the federal public defender’s office, Abrego Garcia spoke only once, through a translator. “I understand,” he said in response to the judge’s reading of the charges.
The charges against Abrego Garcia, 29, are “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.”
Friday’s hearing, in a downtown Nashville federal courtroom, turned primarily on the question of whether Abrego Garcia may be denied the opportunity to be released from jail pending trial.
Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes said she would take the matter under advisement. She said she will issue a written ruling on the prosecution’s motion to keep Abrego Garcia detained “sooner rather than later.”
The criminal charges stem from a federal investigation opened into a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. Abrego Garcia was not arrested or charged in the incident.
‘ICE out of Baltimore!’: Recent immigration raids prompt Baltimore protest

But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop gave rise to the charges he now faces, testimony in court Friday revealed.
The investigation relied on cooperating witnesses, analysis of license plate readers to track Abrego Garcia’s movements and a review of the Tennessee traffic stop evidence.
Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire alleged that Abrego Garcia was a danger to the community and a member of the MS-13 gang who, for nine years, engaged in an illegal smuggling operation that included transporting children, gang members and guns. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with gun crimes or crimes involving child victims.
Attorneys for Abrego Garcia said the government’s case should be looked at through a “lens of suspicion and skepticism” and questioned why it took three years to bring.
“The United States government from D.C. to Tennessee has exaggerated” allegations against Abrego Garcia, said Dumaka Shabazz, one of Abrego Garcia’s public defenders.
“This is a house of cards built on the unverified credibility of unreliable corroborators,” he said. “The only reason they’re calling him dangerous now is to justify denying him due process and subjecting him to cruel and inhuman punishment they have to cover up,” said Shabazz, referencing Abrego Garcia’s imprisonment for nearly three months in a notorious Salvadoran prison.
McGuire countered that the charges against Abrego Garcia arose from following the facts. “Since I’ve learned about this case, all I’ve tried to do is the right thing,” he said. “The facts are I didn’t … whip up witnesses and tell them to commit perjury.”
“I understand there are strong feelings about this case on both sides,” he said.
The day-long hearing focused on the government’s arguments to detain Abrego Garcia until trial.
Evidence that minors were present, and potentially placed at risk during Abrego Garcia’s alleged illegal acts could trigger legal justification for detaining Abrego Garcia and prosecutors presented allegations involving the safety of minors. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with crimes related to minor victims.
But prosecutors said a Department of Homeland Security investigation into the circumstances behind the 2022 traffic stop uncovered evidence that Abrego Garcia transported minor children, including his own, in part to provide cover for his allegedly illegal activities.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Abrego Garcia, McGuire alleged, acted as the driver in a human smuggling operation that involved transporting migrants already in the country illegally to different points around the nation over a nine-year period.
McGuire cited a witness who said that Abrego Garcia engaged in sexual, but not physical, exchanges with her several years ago when she was a teen and referenced a list of passengers the Tennessee Highway Patrol obtained during the 2022 traffic stop. One of the passengers listed his age as 15.
“Migrant transportation is inherently dangerous,” McGuire said. “The defendant transported his own children in an unsafe manner.”
McGuire argued that Abrego Garcia is a flight risk, and that his newfound notoriety could give him access to resources provided by those opposed to Trump administration immigration policies.
Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes, who presided over the case, called the flight risk argument largely “academic.”
Immigration officials have already placed a hold on Abrego Garcia, giving them the authority to take immediate custody should he be released from jail, she noted.
‘A stain on the Constitution’: Abrego Garcia lawyers refuse to drop his case against U.S.

The sole witness at Friday’s hearing was Peter Joseph, a Department of Homeland Security special agent who said he was first assigned to investigate Abrego Garcia on April 28, three years after the Tennessee traffic stop.
By then, Abrego Garcia was incarcerated inside the Center for Terrorism Confinement prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court had, on April 10, ordered the federal government to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States.
Joseph testified that he had reviewed License Plate Reader software in multiple states that contradicted Abrego Garcia’s statements about his movements to troopers at the time of the Tennessee traffic stop.
He also testified that five confidential witnesses, including co-conspirators in the alleged years-long human smuggling operation, had implicated Abrego Garcia in the scheme.
Richard Tennant, another of Abrego Garcia’s defense attorneys, noted that some of the cooperating witnesses have their own liberty at stake.
Three of the witnesses entered cooperation deals that could aid their ongoing criminal and immigration cases. Four of the five witnesses are from the same family, testimony revealed.

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)As a veteran parent leader and advocate for six years in Prince George’s County, I’ve seen my share of politically motivated nonsense. The mistreatment of Superintendent Millard House II over the past several weeks is easily the most shameful.
Put simply, the Prince George’s County Educators’ Association (PGCEA) and Board of Education got this wrong and should be ashamed of the role they played in his departure. They unfairly attacked a good man who was the right leader for PGCPS and making real progress.
Superintendent House earned my complete confidence over the past two years, which is why I remain willing to unequivocally publicly defend his record today. And I equally defend the dedicated department heads and PGCPS professionals who deserve full credit for their successes.
By every metric, PGCPS should have been negotiating a contract extension. Under Superintendent House, graduation rates rose above 80%, including a 15-point increase for English learners. Major transportation reforms led to significant improvements, with on-time performance now above 80% and a new tracking app and electric buses on the way. School safety investments resulted in a 46% drop in student incidents. And PGCPS had a highly successful Annapolis advocacy effort this year that helped save Community Schools funding and about two-thirds of funding originally at risk of being cut.

Let’s be clear what happened. Some county politicians, board members and special interests would rather play political games and undermine our students’ future than allow major PGCPS successes and any credit for the superintendent. They staged a leadership coup behind closed doors, with no opportunity for public input, while putting a $2.9 billion school system at risk of turning into a patronage system for political appointments.
Past is prologue, as we already saw similar shenanigans at the Board of Education level several years ago as board staff positions were used to hire political allies at taxpayer expense, with many hires ending in controversy.
That is the historical context for this moment, and yet even knowing the professional risk of refusing to play along with unseemly and inappropriate demands, Superintendent House displayed true character, serving as the bulwark who bravely said, “No,” and attempted to keep PGCPS from chaos.
I’ve been through six years of PGCPS battles and seen these games too many times before. Past board members attempted to play politics and micromanage former CEO Dr. Monica Goldson on COVID-19 policy and other issues. She also pushed back, and even on the rare issues where we didn’t agree, we shared mutual respect, and I could always trust her to do the right thing and act in PGCPS’ best interest.
Now, it’s the same playbook, next chapter for Superintendent House. The same politicians who worked to undermine PGCPS accomplishments the past few months had the audacity to blame the superintendent for their own sabotage. And some of the same characters central to this coup did the same thing early in his tenure, nearly derailing more than $800 million in new school construction. Parent leaders called out their games then, and won’t be silent now.
Despite daily PGCPS successes, one constant continues to threaten our school system: Too much political interference in what should be administrative operations. To truly succeed, we must allow administrative leadership to be immune from politics. Hire a qualified education expert as superintendent, give them a four-year term, then stay out of the way.
That doesn’t exclude important oversight on policies, budget and key appointments. But short of serious malfeasance, any superintendent must have the security to do the job we hired them to do. What sane, qualified superintendent would want to work in Prince George’s County after the disgraceful behavior of the past few months?
Finally, we have created chaos at a moment PGCPS can least afford it. With a likely legislative special session in October and challenging state budget situation, good luck trying to win much-needed resources as Prince George’s County proves incapable of governing ourselves responsibly.
If PGCEA leadership had taken a fraction of the energy they spent attacking the Superintendent and used it to truly fight for protecting Blueprint funding, perhaps PGCPS could more easily meet their contract demands.
Instead, now some other school district will gain a highly qualified and successful Superintendent while PGCPS searches for our fourth leader since 2018. That is no way to run a world-class school district, and like always, it will be the students of PGCPS who pay the price. And once again, the same old Prince George’s politics to blame.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/pgcps-1-1024x768-1.jpg,,,2025-06-14 05:00:37.615098

(Prostock-Studio/Getty Images)Like it or not, artificial intelligence has become part of daily life. Many devices — including electric razors and toothbrushes — have become “AI-powered,” using machine learning algorithms to track how a person uses the device, how the device is working in real time, and provide feedback. From asking questions to an AI assistant like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot to monitoring a daily fitness routine with a smartwatch, many people use an AI system or tool every day.
While AI tools and technologies can make life easier, they also raise important questions about data privacy. These systems often collect large amounts of data, sometimes without people even realizing their data is being collected. The information can then be used to identify personal habits and preferences, and even predict future behaviors by drawing inferences from the aggregated data.
As an assistant professor of cybersecurity at West Virginia University, I study how emerging technologies and various types of AI systems manage personal data and how we can build more secure, privacy-preserving systems for the future.
Generative AI software uses large amounts of training data to create new content such as text or images. Predictive AI uses data to forecast outcomes based on past behavior, such as how likely you are to hit your daily step goal, or what movies you may want to watch. Both types can be used to gather information about you.
How AI tools collect data
Generative AI assistants such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini collect all the information users type into a chat box. Every question, response and prompt that users enter is recorded, stored and analyzed to improve the AI model.
OpenAI’s privacy policy informs users that “we may use content you provide us to improve our Services, for example to train the models that power ChatGPT.” Even though OpenAI allows you to opt out of content use for model training, it still collects and retains your personal data. Although some companies promise that they anonymize this data, meaning they store it without naming the person who provided it, there is always a risk of data being reidentified.
Predictive AI
Beyond generative AI assistants, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok continuously gather data on their users to train predictive AI models. Every post, photo, video, like, share and comment, including the amount of time people spend looking at each of these, is collected as data points that are used to build digital data profiles for each person who uses the service.
The profiles can be used to refine the social media platform’s AI recommender systems. They can also be sold to data brokers, who sell a person’s data to other companies to, for instance, help develop targeted advertisements that align with that person’s interests.
Many social media companies also track users across websites and applications by putting cookies and embedded tracking pixels on their computers. Cookies are small files that store information about who you are and what you clicked on while browsing a website.
One of the most common uses of cookies is in digital shopping carts: When you place an item in your cart, leave the website and return later, the item will still be in your cart because the cookie stored that information. Tracking pixels are invisible images or snippets of code embedded in websites that notify companies of your activity when you visit their page. This helps them track your behavior across the internet.
This is why users often see or hear advertisements that are related to their browsing and shopping habits on many of the unrelated websites they browse, and even when they are using different devices, including computers, phones and smart speakers. One study found that some websites can store over 300 tracking cookies on your computer or mobile phone.
Data privacy controls — and limitations
Like generative AI platforms, social media platforms offer privacy settings and opt-outs, but these give people limited control over how their personal data is aggregated and monetized. As media theorist Douglas Rushkoff argued in 2011, if the service is free, you are the product.
Many tools that include AI don’t require a person to take any direct action for the tool to collect data about that person. Smart devices such as home speakers, fitness trackers and watches continually gather information through biometric sensors, voice recognition and location tracking. Smart home speakers continually listen for the command to activate or “wake up” the device. As the device is listening for this word, it picks up all the conversations happening around it, even though it does not seem to be active.
Some companies claim that voice data is only stored when the wake word — what you say to wake up the device — is detected. However, people have raised concerns about accidental recordings, especially because these devices are often connected to cloud services, which allow voice data to be stored, synced and shared across multiple devices such as your phone, smart speaker and tablet.
If the company allows, it’s also possible for this data to be accessed by third parties, such as advertisers, data analytics firms or a law enforcement agency with a warrant.
Privacy rollbacks
This potential for third-party access also applies to smartwatches and fitness trackers, which monitor health metrics and user activity patterns. Companies that produce wearable fitness devices are not considered “covered entities” and so are not bound by the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act. This means that they are legally allowed to sell health- and location-related data collected from their users.
Concerns about HIPAA data arose in 2018, when Strava, a fitness company released a global heat map of user’s exercise routes. In doing so, it accidentally revealed sensitive military locations across the globe through highlighting the exercise routes of military personnel.
The Trump administration has tapped Palantir, a company that specializes in using AI for data analytics, to collate and analyze data about Americans. Meanwhile, Palantir has announced a partnership with a company that runs self-checkout systems.
Such partnerships can expand corporate and government reach into everyday consumer behavior. This one could be used to create detailed personal profiles on Americans by linking their consumer habits with other personal data. This raises concerns about increased surveillance and loss of anonymity. It could allow citizens to be tracked and analyzed across multiple aspects of their lives without their knowledge or consent.
Some smart device companies are also rolling back privacy protections instead of strengthening them. Amazon recently announced that starting on March 28, 2025, all voice recordings from Amazon Echo  devices would be sent to Amazon’s cloud by default, and users will no longer have the option to turn this function off. This is different from previous settings, which allowed users to limit private data collection.
Changes like these raise concerns about how much control consumers have over their own data when using smart devices. Many privacy experts consider cloud storage of voice recordings a form of data collection, especially when used to improve algorithms or build user profiles, which has implications for data privacy laws designed to protect online privacy.
Implications for data privacy
All of this brings up serious privacy concerns for people and governments on how AI tools collect, store, use and transmit data. The biggest concern is transparency. People don’t know what data is being collected, how the data is being used, and who has access to that data.
Companies tend to use complicated privacy policies filled with technical jargon to make it difficult for people to understand the terms of a service that they agree to. People also tend not to read terms of service documents. One study found that people averaged 73 seconds reading a terms of service document that had an average read time of 29-32 minutes.
Data collected by AI tools may initially reside with a company that you trust, but can easily be sold and given to a company that you don’t trust.
AI tools, the companies in charge of them and the companies that have access to the data they collect can also be subject to cyberattacks and data breaches that can reveal sensitive personal information. These attacks can by carried out by cybercriminals who are in it for the money, or by so-called advanced persistent threats, which are typically nation/state- sponsored attackers who gain access to networks and systems and remain there undetected, collecting information and personal data to eventually cause disruption or harm.
While laws and regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act aim to safeguard user data, AI development and use have often outpaced the legislative process. The laws are still catching up on AI and data privacy. For now, you should assume any AI-powered device or platform is collecting data on your inputs, behaviors and patterns.
Using AI tools
Although AI tools collect people’s data, and the way this accumulation of data affects people’s data privacy is concerning, the tools can also be useful. AI-powered applications can streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks and provide valuable insights.
But it’s crucial to approach these tools with awareness and caution.
When using a generative AI platform that gives you answers to questions you type in a prompt, don’t include any personally identifiable information, including names, birth dates, Social Security numbers or home addresses. At the workplace, don’t include trade secrets or classified information. In general, don’t put anything into a prompt that you wouldn’t feel comfortable revealing to the public or seeing on a billboard. Remember, once you hit enter on the prompt, you’ve lost control of that information.
Remember that devices which are turned on are always listening — even if they’re asleep. If you use smart home or embedded devices, turn them off when you need to have a private conversation.

Steny Hoyer’s (D-5th) 44th annual bull roast took turns heaping praise on the long-serving Democrat and heaping scorn on President Donald Trump (R).
When it finally came time for him to speak, Hoyer mostly followed that script. And then he danced.
Despite humid temperatures and threatening skies, and the prospect of a military parade Saturday on what happens to be Trump’s 79th birthday, the overall mood was light among the hundreds who turned out to honor the dean of Maryland’s congressional delegation — who turns 86 Saturday on the birthday he shares with Trump.
“We’re gathered here today before Donald Trump is spending millions and millions of dollars of taxpayer money to have a parade to feed his ego on Donald Trump’s birthday,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md).
“I can tell you, I’m not going to be anywhere near President Trump tomorrow, but I am very proud to be here to celebrate the birthday of a great American who didn’t choose to have his birthday the same day as Donald Trump,” Van Hollen said.
Bashing Trump and praising Hoyer served as part of the main theme Friday at the bull roast at Newton White Mansion in Prince George’s County. Lawmakers including Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th) and Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), all of whom took a turn at the microphone.
Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) chastised the Trump administration one day after U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) was forcibly removed by federal law enforcement officials at a press conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The secretary held it amid multiday protests in Los Angeles against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.
“The garbage that is being thrown at us [by the administration] where a group of goons threw a United States senator to the ground. It is unprecedented,” Elfreth said.

“What gives me calm on that House floor is, I can turn to Steny and sit down and say, ‘This is just bulls— and what are we going to do about it?’” said Elfreth, who served long ago as an intern in Hoyer’s office. “And without a doubt, he has an answer.”
One thing Hoyer didn’t have the answer for Friday is whether he plans to seek a 24th term in Congress — a question that always seems to be lingering in the background of recent bull roasts.
“It’ll be time for that,” Hoyer said in a brief interview after the bull roast celebration.
Hoyer has been prominent in Maryland politics since before his tenure in Congress, winning a seat in the state Senate at age 27 and becoming its youngest president nine years lalter. He was elected to the House in 1981 to represent the district that currently includes portions of Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties and all three Southern Maryland counties.
During that time he has risen to serve as No. 2 Democrat in the House. He has been credited with helping former President Joe Biden (D) get the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed and is seen as the quarterback behind an on-again, off-again push to relocate the aging FBI headquarters from Washington, D.C., to a site in Greenbelt in Prince George’s County.
After getting General Services Administration clearance for the Greenbelt site, the FBI effort has recently shifted to defense, after the Trump administration said it wants to relocate the FBI to Alabama. Hoyer has emerged as a leader of that fight
Gov. Wes Moore (D) highlighted how Hoyer was instrumental in getting the Americans with Disabilities Act passed in 1990.
“The reason that I love Steny Hoyer is time and time again when it was hard, Steny stood up,” Moore said to an applause from some attendees.
‘Rest of his life’
Even with all the accolades, Hoyer has at least one Democratic challenger for the 2026 primary election.
Harry Jarin, 35, an emergency services consultant and volunteer firefighter who resides in Edgewater in Anne Arundel County, officially launched his candidacy for the seat May 29.
“We don’t need more career politicians who can’t really connect with voters and don’t really understand what people go through on a daily basis just to live in this country,” Jarin said in an interview Friday afternoon.

	“If we put someone like Steny Hoyer back up for office for a 24th term, we’re sending a message to the rest of the country that we’re all about the status quo and that Democrats aren’t offering anything different,” he said. “Voters made it very clear back in November that they want something different.”
Jarin didn’t shy away from the age differential between him and Hoyer, noting the death last month of Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who was 75. Connolly was the third House Democrat to die in office this year.
“I don’t think we should be reelecting people where we need to consult an actuary to determine whether or not they’re going to survive another two-year term,” Jarin said.
But for attendees at Friday’s bull roast, there was no question about whether Hoyer deserves to remain in office.
Prince George’s County resident Henrietta Holiday recalled when she met Hoyer in 2002 at Joint Base Andrews. Holiday is an Air Force veteran.
“His relationships are genuine. When you’re dealing with Steny Hoyer, you never feel like you’re dealing with a politician,” Holiday said. “I can see him running for another term. I would love to see him do what he loves for the rest of his life.”
Most of the three-hour event was spent socializing between elected officials and friends, bottled water in hand on a humid day, and even some chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches for the fortunate ones.
Minutes before the bull roast ended, Hoyer was presented a birthday cake. Then he decided to do a little dance.
“Ladies and gentlemen: Tomorrow, I want you to do something for me. When that parade comes on, you say, ‘That parade for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army — and Steny Hoyer,’” he said. “God bless you.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Steny-Hoyer-6-13-2025-1024x602.jpg,,,2025-06-14 03:58:45.643677

The demonstration in downtown Omaha was sparked by organizers including Juan Elizondo, in the wake of Tuesday’s high-profile worksite enforcement raid on a food plant in Omaha that led to the detention of nearly 80 workers.
“We hope to gain attention to our despair,” Elizondo, 32, said of the protest on opening day of the nationally televised NCAA men’s baseball tournament. “All of us know somebody affected. They are people of the community. We are the product of our community, and we feel it’s our duty to step up and have our voices heard.”
 ‘No Kings’

On the heels of Friday’s protest is another planned midday Saturday across the Missouri River, at Tom Hanafan River’s Edge Park in Council Bluffs. That rally, separately organized, brings together Omaha and Bluffs residents to join the national “No Kings” protests calling out what organizers describe as authoritarian overreach by the Trump administration.
Organizers behind the “No Kings” protests have branded Saturday as a “day of defiance.” According to their website, 13 protests are planned throughout Nebraska, including in Lincoln.
“Our nation is our combined effort,” said Kevin Gibbs, chair of Indivisible Nebraska. “No one person owns it. … We Nebraskans and Iowans take this opportunity to stand in this moment together and defend America’s shared vision against those who would cut it down to serve themselves.”
Gov. Jim Pillen, a public supporter of the president’s actions, on Friday issued an emergency proclamation that activated the Nebraska National Guard and prepared state law enforcement resources for immediate deployment, if needed.
Friday’s immigration enforcement-related demonstration in downtown Omaha — which played out largely on the corridor between the CHI Health Center and Charles Schwab Field, where CWS teams play — appeared peaceful. Elizondo estimated that more than 1,000 people participated.

Earlier in the day, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which led the Tuesday raid, announced that it had arrested four protesters on Thursday for “aggressive” actions during and immediately after the raid at Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha.
ICE officials said the agency targeted Glenn Valley because of suspected use of stolen or fraudulent identification by workers to gain employment — and described “victims” of the situation as those whose personal information was fraudulently used or stolen.
Demonstrators at the Friday anti-ICE march had a different message. They held placards with messages such as “Decriminalize Immigration,” “ICE is bitter cold,” “Keep Families Together,” “Hands off our community” and “Irony: a 34-count felon calling immigrants criminals.” 
 ‘To be heard and seen’ 

Among those protesting were Stephanie Campos, Gustavo Campos and Antonio Mendoza of the Omaha area. They said they were surprised but glad to see the large number of supporters who gathered first at a riverfront volleyball court and walked several blocks to the CWS area, which was bustling with activity.

“It’s good to see all the different ethnicities come together,” said Mendoza, 25. “Whatever background we come from, we know right from wrong.”
Gustavo Campos, 21, hoped protests nationally against immigration tactics will make a difference. But he said that in any case, he wanted to show support “for families, my community.” 
Said Mendoza, 25: “Just to be heard and seen is huge — showing up.” 
The Trump administration seemed to acknowledge some of the public pushback nationally and perhaps industry-level pushback from farmers, meatpackers and food processors with new guidance this week largely pausing immigration raids and arrests in the agriculture and hospitality industries, according to a Friday report in the New York Times.
 Los Angeles and elsewhere

The heartland protests coincide with larger, mostly peaceful but tenser demonstrations in Los Angeles as a result of recent ICE raids there.
The Trump administration and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have been butting heads as the president deployed 4,000 California National Guard and 700 Marines to the second-largest U.S. city in response to the protests — but without permission from the state’s Democratic governor.

Newsom responded by accusing Trump of choosing “theatrics over public safety” and escalating the “chaos.” The California governor sued the Trump administration over the federalization and deployment of the National Guard.
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and 18 other Republican attorneys general joined a legal brief in support of Trump’s deployment of the National Guard, arguing that Trump has the “authority” to do so. 
“We stand with law enforcement, we support President Trump’s action, and we will not let chaos take hold in our states,” Hilgers said in a joint statement. 
The events in Los Angeles have sparked similar protests in Texas, New York, Illinois and other parts of the country. More protests are planned this weekend as Trump plans a military parade to celebrate the Army’s anniversary in Washington D.C. this Saturday.  
 Violence not tolerated

Omaha Mayor John Ewing, a Democrat who took office earlier this week after unseating three-term Republican Mayor Jean Stothert, said the city is thankful for “how peacefully” protesters in Omaha so far have handled the ICE raid.
He said acts of violence or vandalism will not be tolerated and “frankly hurt any message protesters want to give.”
“Omaha Police have plans in place to let peaceful protests occur without obstruction to the game,” he said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)OWENSBORO — Kentucky Democrats brought a national leader to their statewide dinner Friday evening — but the party wants to focus on “everyday issues.”
At a sold-out event in the Ohio River town of Owensboro, the Democrats’ keynote speaker was Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin. 
But first Gov. Andy Beshear spoke, laying  out a case against Republican President Donald Trump and his “big beautiful bill.”
“The best way to push back against Trump is to show that when Democrats win, we stay focused on the issues that matter most to our people,” the governor told the crowd. “And then do something the Republican Party has shown it can’t — we govern well.”
Democrats from across the commonwealth were receptive to the message, cheering the governor on and giving him standing ovations. 
The party’s Forward Together Dinner, which sold 475 tickets, preceded the Kentucky Democratic Party state convention when party faithful decide who will lead the executive committees for the next year. Friday’s dinner was the largest Kentucky Democratic Party dinner since 2012. 
The enthusiasm follows setbacks for Democrats in recent years; the party has lost ground in the state legislature and statewide offices. A couple weeks ahead of the convention, Sen. Robin Webb, a longtime Democrat from Eastern Kentucky, joined the Republican Party. She said the party’s dismissiveness of rural issues led her to make that decision.

Much of the Democratic speakers’ comments throughout the night focused on the party’s need to re-focus on small town America. 
Beshear told reporters ahead of his remarks that political parties need to compete everywhere. Kentucky has no elections in 2025, but a slew of races next year — including U.S. Senate, congressional seats and legislative seats. 
“I want to see as many candidates as possible, but I’m also always going to be honest with candidates that sign up to run,” he said. He then recalled sitting with his father, former Gov. Steve Beshear, after election losses and said he knows what that disappointment “feels like.”
“So as long as people have reasonable expectations and know what they are getting into, know that oftentimes flipping a seat can take one, two or three elections, I want to be as encouraging as I can, but I’m a human being, and I always want to make sure we’re talking about how tough races can be,” Beshear said. “But, yes, I want to see Democratic candidates in as many races as possible.”

Beshear will be the chair of the Democratic Governors Association next year, putting him in a place to rally Democratic support for midterm elections nationally. He’s also being eyed as a possible contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. 
For this year, he said he is optimistic about Democrats’ chances in the New Jersey and Virginia governor races. He added that “we’re going to have some really exciting possibilities next year in places that people aren’t expecting right now.”
Martin told Kentucky Democrats that the Democratic National Committee (DNC)  under his leadership is focusing on getting “the DNC out of D.C.” He led the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and has a history as a labor and union organizer.
“When we organize everywhere, we can win anywhere,” Martin told the crowd. “That means we don’t give up on red states. That means we don’t give up on rural counties. We take our message everywhere.”
He expanded on that strategy with reporters afterwards. He said he doesn’t believe that “red states” or “blue states” stay that way over time. 
“This new DNC has to invest everywhere so we can build not just to win this moment but to win the future,” Martin said.
Kentucky Democratic Party Chairman Colmon Elridge told reporters state parties are excited about more dollar investments from the party’s national committee and that may help Democrats build back their grassroots campaigns. 
“I feel really great about our potential for 2026. I believe we’re going to contest a heck of a lot of races that we did not contest in the last election,” Elridge said. “And of course our goal in ’26 and beyond is to contest every race.”
Cherlynn Stevenson, the former chair of the state House Democratic Caucus, said ahead of the dinner that Democrats need to focus on “everyday issues,” including how Kentuckians are impacted by federal policies under the Trump administration. One big policy Democrats at all levels have been pushing back against is Trump’s budget reconciliation bill that includes cuts to Medicaid. 
She is seeking election in the 6th Congressional District, held by Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr who is now running for U.S. Senate. 
“If our people aren’t fed, and they’re not healthy, then our children can’t learn and our workers can’t produce when they go to work everyday,” Stevenson said. “So, we’ve got to get back to the meat and potatoes of what it means to take care of everyday Kentuckians and not kowtow to billionaires and succumb to the chaos that’s coming down from Washington.”

(Photo by Jacob Boomsma via Getty Images Plus)With temperatures forecast to soar as high as 89 degrees in Interior Alaska, the National Weather Service has issued its first-ever heat advisories for the state.
The advisories, which started Thursday and are in effect through Sunday, warn residents in the Fairbanks area and a wider swath of Interior Alaska to be careful about outdoor activities over the weekend.  
“Take extra precautions when working in the sun. Wear sunscreen and lightweight, loose fitting clothing. Try to limit strenuous activities to early morning or evening. Take action when you see symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke,” the National Weather Service said Friday in its special statement.
For context, the normal June high temperature in Fairbanks is 72 degrees.
While Alaska has occasionally had such high temperatures before, the practice of issuing heat advisories is new in the farthest-north state, said Brian Brettschneider, a National Weather Service climate scientist.
The service officially added heat advisories to its list of Alaska warnings earlier this year, Brettschneider said. The decision stems from the state’s experiences in 2019, when an ultra-hot summer was marked by long-lasting wildfires that poured smoke into populated areas and a record 90-degree temperature in Anchorage, the state’s largest city.
“We kind of realized, ‘Whoa, maybe extreme heat is something that we need to think more about.’ And even though we’ve had occasional extreme heat in the past, it really kind of brought to the forefront that we need to think about it as part of our mission for protecting life and property,” he said.
Temperatures in the 80s might not seem extreme in the Lower 48 states, but they can have big impacts on Alaska residents, Brettschneider said.
Part of that is because the homes and other elements of the built environment are structured for a cold climate, he said. “In Alaska, our homes are built to retain every molecule of heat, basically, and we have 20 hours of daylight,” he said. And part of that is because at Alaska’s high latitude, the angle of the sun is low, “so the solar energy is penetrating deep into the houses” and is otherwise unrelenting nearly around the clock, he said.
“What might be considered pleasant weather in the Lower 48 really has an outsized impact on our comfort and our health here,” he said.
Research led by the University of Alaska Anchorage has found that 70 degrees is generally the threshold at which Alaskans begin to suffer heat-related health problems.
Brettschneider said the current heat baking Interior Alaska is the product of a big ridge of high pressure. That has replaced what was a persistent low-pressure system that previously kept parts of the state unseasonably cool.
Fairbanks’ record high temperature was 96 degrees, recorded in 1969, Brettschneider said.

The company has said it will spend at least $7 billion to develop the huge Willow field and that first production is expected by the end of the decade. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A federal appeals court on Friday upheld the Biden administration’s approval of a major oil development on Alaska’s North Slope, even though it identified one flaw with the action.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a divided decision, said the U.S. Bureau of Land Management largely abided by federal laws when it granted approval to ConocoPhillips to develop the huge Willow project.
Despite one problem that the ruling characterized as “minor,” the approval shall stand, said the majority opinion, written by Judge Ryan D. Nelson.
The ruling allows ConocoPhillips to keep developing Willow, which holds about 600 million barrels of reserves and is slated to produce up to 180,000 barrels per day and be the westernmost operating oil field on the North Slope. And it rejects arguments from environmental and Native plaintiffs who said the BLM approval violated requirements for considering the cumulative and climate impacts of the huge development, impacts to endangered species and other issues.
The identified flaw stems from the BLM’s decision to approve a Willow development plan with three drill pads rather than the five ConocoPhillips had proposed. The scaled-back plan approved in 2023 also required ConocoPhillips to give up leases on about 68,000 acres, almost all of that in the ecologically sensitive Teshekpuk Lake area.
During the environmental study process that led to the approval decision, the BLM had expressed the position that it needed to consider full field development rather than piecemeal development, the ruling said. “And then when it came time to issue the final approval, it never explained whether its adopted alternative satisfied the full field development standard,” the ruling said.
But that was a “at heart, a procedural, not a substantive violation,” the ruling said. The development approval is to remain in place, the decision said. Overturning the approval is “unwarranted because the procedural error was minor and the on-the-ground consequences (of vacating it) would be severe,” the decision said.
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Gabriel Sanchez said the flaw was serious enough to justify overturning the permit. “BLM’s errors were more fundamental than simply failing to explain how it applied the full field development standard among the alternatives it reviewed,” he said. The agency wrongly excluded consideration of smaller alternatives when it was deciding whether to allow “the largest domestic oil drilling project on federal public lands,” he said.
Willow has been the subject of heated national debate. The discovery, on federal leases that date as far back as 1999, has inspired other exploration in the area, as well as hopes for state officials for a development renaissance on the North Slope. Oil production in the region is now less than a quarter of the 2 million-barrel-a-day peak hit in 1988.
Environmental activists, however, have described the project as a “climate bomb” that will pour substantial new amounts of planet-heating carbon gases into the atmosphere.
Friday’s ruling is the latest in a yearslong series of legal challenges that have created roadblocks to Willow development. In 2021, U.S. District Court Sharon Gleason overturned a prior approval of Willow. She ordered the BLM to complete a formal supplemental environmental impact statement to better analyze climate impacts and impacts to threatened polar bears. The 2023 project approval is the product of that supplemental study.

	ConocoPhillips, which is already well into Willow construction and plans to spend at least $7 billion on development, described Friday’s ruling as good news.
“ConocoPhillips welcomes the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision, which allows construction on the Willow project to continue. We recently completed another significant winter construction season, and the project remains on track for first oil in 2029,” company spokesperson Rebecca Boys said by email.
“We look forward to continuing the responsible development of Willow, which will enhance American energy security while expanding local employment opportunities and providing extensive benefits to Alaska Native communities and the State of Alaska.”
Over the past winter season, crews delivered modular structures and worked on road, pad, bridge, work camp and pipeline construction, Boys said.
That work was allowed to proceed because the 9th Circuit Court in December denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a restraining order blocking it.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case had mixed responses to Friday’s decision.
Some were highly critical.
“This decision is bad news for the planet and anyone who cares about the impacts of industrialization on communities now and in the future,” Bridget Psarianos, an attorney with the environmental law firm Trustees for Alaska, said in a statement.
“The bureau is required under the law to protect the western Arctic’s sensitive ecosystem and the subsistence users who rely on them. But the agency did not minimize the harm from this project on the Arctic’s people, animals, habitat, and the planet in a real way, in violation of the law. There is too much at stake to gloss over the harm this project will do,” said Psarianos, who is representing some of the plaintiffs.
It will probably be fairly simple for the BLM to address the court-identified flaw, Psarianos said in a follow-up email. The agency could submit a report or a memorandum explaining its reasoning, leaving the approval unaffected, she said.
Other plaintiff representatives portrayed the ruling as a vindication, albeit a partial one.
“Today’s ruling is a significant step forward for Alaska’s North Slope,” Hallie Templeton, legal director for plaintiff Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. “We hope that this will push BLM to heed the significant risks that Willow poses and deny it for good. While this should be the final straw for the doomed Willow Project, we will continue fighting to prevent this carbon bomb project from destroying one of our last remaining wild places.”

That experience helped shape his life goals then, and now that he’s 25 years old, he also holds that memory as a crucial lesson on resilience and the importance of family support. But, at the same time, the trip was a reminder of disparities prevailing along the Wasatch Front, where I-15 has historically been a divider that has dictated where investment is located.
That’s about to change with the incoming Eccles Hospital and Health Campus, an 800,000-square-foot University of Utah project that’s set to bring the institution’s largest off-campus medical facility to the west side of the valley, with room for a multi-specialty health center offering 200 exam rooms and an emergency department, in addition to an in-patient hospital with 130 rooms. The campus also means that Menjivar will have the chance to serve his own community as a doctor. 
“First and foremost, it’s a place of healing, but it will be more than that,” Menjivar said during a groundbreaking ceremony for the facility on Friday. “This hospital is going to bring us closer to health care. It’s going to bring access to our community, more opportunity for jobs, for increased representation and for trust.”

Combined, West Valley residents travel over 12 million miles a year for treatment since specialty health care isn’t much available in their communities. Nine out of 10 in-patient beds in Salt Lake County are also on the east side of I-15, according to Gina Hawley, chief operating officer for University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics.
“Studies have shown that where you don’t have health care closer to a community, that’s easily accessible, that’s provided by providers and staff members that are from that community, that know that community well, you actually have worse outcomes in the long term, which is why it’s so important for us to have a hospital and clinic out in West Valley,” Hawley said. 
West-siders face health disparities, including life expectancies 10 years lower than their east-side counterparts, as well as a 44% greater prevalence of diabetes and a 38% higher prevalence of stroke, according to a U. report.

“The biggest thing is it’s disconnected. There’s not one big health care system, like we have systems there, but nothing really feels like one big, interconnected system that has a lot of resources and a lot of access,” Menjivar told Utah News Dispatch. “It’s not to say that the hospitals (on the west side) are bad necessarily, or they’re not trying, but they just don’t have as much capacity as a place like the University of Utah does.” 
The project had been a couple of years in the making, but Friday marked the official start of the building that promises to breach gaps in health care access in the valley. The multi-specialty center phase is scheduled to open in late 2028 and the in-patient hospital by 2029.
The hospital campus’ name was coined after a $75 million gift from George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Foundation. But, the hospital is expected to fund most of its estimated $855 million budget with $800 million in bonds allocated by the Utah Legislature.

Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, who grew up in Taylorsville said during the ceremony that, as a west-sider, she understands the importance of such a feat. 
“U.S. News and World Report just ranked Utah the best state in the nation for the third year in a row. Now these are things that we love to brag about as leaders of the state, and they’re things we should brag about. They’re things to be very proud of,” Henderson said. “And in terms of health care, we are ranked high as well. Health care outcomes, we’re in top 10. But in health care accessibility, we’re 35 of 50. We can do better. We need to do better. We are going to do better.”
Apart from the accessibility solutions, the hospital is also meant to be a place reflective of the area, the most diverse in the state. 
Community committees have repeatedly met, helping shape the vision for the campus — one that includes providers that look and sound like their neighbors, and place a special emphasis on different cultural sensitivities in the area.
During the event, University of Utah President Taylor Randall reflected on the community that has made time to connect with their new neighbors and help make this new facility a substantial asset for the area, and potentially, an important part of Utah doctors’ educational journey.
“These are the types of projects that, to me, are the reason I like to lead an educational institution, because they are projects that bring people together,” Randall said. “They are projects that make us wrestle with the hard problems of society, but they give us momentum and hope that what we will see in the future is something better than what we see today.”

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on June 13 before Abrego Garcia's arraignment on federal charges. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation to an El Salvador prison sparked national debate over Trump administration immigration crackdowns, entered not guilty pleas on Friday to two federal human smuggling charges. 
Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and seated next to attorneys with the federal public defender’s office, Abrego Garcia spoke only once, through a translator. “I understand,” he said in response to the judge’s reading of the charges. 
The charges against Abrego Garcia, 29, are “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.” 
Friday’s hearing, in a downtown Nashville federal courtroom, turned primarily on the question of whether Abrego Garcia may be denied the opportunity to be released from jail pending trial. 
Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes said she would take the matter under advisement. She said she will issue a written ruling on the prosecution’s motion to keep Abrego Garcia detained “sooner rather than later.”
Advocacy organizations warn ‘we are all Kilmar’; pledge to fight for immigrant rights

The criminal charges stem from a federal investigation opened into a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. 
Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. Abrego Garcia was not arrested or charged in the incident. 
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop gave rise to the charges he now faces, testimony in court Friday revealed.
The investigation relied on cooperating witnesses, analysis of license plate readers to track Abrego Garcia’s movements and a review of the Tennessee traffic stop evidence. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire alleged that Abrego Garcia was a danger to the community and a member of the MS-13 gang who, for nine years, engaged in an illegal smuggling operation that included transporting children, gang members and guns. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with gun crimes or crimes involving child victims.
Attorneys for Abrego Garcia said the government’s case should be looked at through a “lens of suspicion and skepticism” and questioned why it took three years to bring.

“The United States government from D.C. to Tennessee has exaggerated” allegations against Abrego Garcia, said Dumaka Shabazz, one of Abrego Garcia’s public defenders.  
“This is a house of cards built on the unverified credibility of unreliable corroborators,” he said. “The only reason they’re calling him dangerous now is to justify denying him due process and subjecting him to cruel and inhuman punishment they have to cover up,” said Shabazz, referencing Abrego Garcia’s imprisonment for nearly three months in a notorious Salvadoran prison. 
McGuire countered that the charges against Abrego Garcia arose from following the facts. “Since I’ve learned about this case, all I’ve tried to do is the right thing,” he said. “The facts are I didn’t … whip up witnesses and tell them to commit perjury.”
“I understand there are strong feelings about this case on both sides,” he said. 
The day-long hearing focused on the government’s arguments to detain Abrego Garcia until trial. 
Evidence that minors were present, and potentially placed at risk during Abrego Garcia’s alleged illegal acts could trigger legal justification for detaining Abrego Garcia and prosecutors presented allegations involving the safety of minors. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with crimes related to minor victims.

But prosecutors said a Department of Homeland Security investigation into the circumstances behind the 2022 traffic stop uncovered evidence that Abrego Garcia transported minor children, including his own, in part to provide cover for his allegedly illegal activities.
Abrego Garcia, McGuire alleged, acted as the driver in a human smuggling operation that involved transporting migrants already in the country illegally to different points around the nation over a nine-year period. 
McGuire cited a witness who said that Abrego Garcia engaged in sexual, but not physical, exchanges with her several years ago when she was a teen and referenced a list of passengers the Tennessee Highway Patrol obtained during the 2022 traffic stop. One of the passengers listed his age as 15.  
“Migrant transportation is inherently dangerous,” McGuire said. “The defendant transported his own children in an unsafe manner.”
McGuire argued that Abrego Garcia is a flight risk, and that his newfound notoriety could give him access to resources provided by those opposed to Trump administration immigration policies.  
Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes, who presided over the case, called the flight risk argument largely “academic.” 
Kilmar Abrego Garcia arraignment in Nashville

Immigration officials have already placed a hold on Abrego Garcia, giving them the authority to take immediate custody should he be released from jail, she noted.
The sole witness at Friday’s hearing was Peter Joseph, a Department of Homeland Security special agent who said he was first assigned to investigate Abrego Garcia on April 28, three years after the Tennessee traffic stop.  
By then, Abrego Garcia was incarcerated inside the Center for Terrorism Confinement prison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court had, on April 10, ordered the federal government to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return to the United States. 
Joseph testified that he had reviewed License Plate Reader software in multiple states that contradicted Abrego Garcia’s statements about his movements to troopers at the time of the Tennessee traffic stop.
He also testified that five confidential witnesses, including co-conspirators in the alleged years-long human smuggling operation, had implicated Abrego Garcia in the scheme. 
Richard Tennant, another of Abrego Garcia’s defense attorneys, noted that some of the cooperating witnesses have their own liberty at stake. 
Three of the witnesses entered cooperation deals that could aid their ongoing criminal and immigration cases. Four of the five witnesses are from the same family, testimony revealed.

(Photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)The University System of Maryland’s Board of Regents voted Friday to approve a fiscal 2026 budget that is 7% smaller than last year’s allocation, as well as tuition increases of up to 5% and fee hikes up to 10%.
The almost $8 billion budget, already approved by Gov. Wes Moore and the General Assembly, will trim operating costs while aiming to increase revenue to make up for $155 million in reduced funding. These reductions follow an almost 4% cut to the University System last year.
“At this extraordinary time, our universities must make some difficult decisions as they close their budget gaps,” University System Chancellor Jay Perman said Friday.
On Thursday, Perman took the unusual step of sending a video message to more than 40,000 faculty and staff members across the system, apologizing for the coming budget cuts but telling staff to brace for them. He replayed that video for the board on Friday.
While university administrators will first seek to generate new revenue and will protect employees from cuts as much as possible, the “sheer size of the cut we’re absorbing means that, for some universities, personnel actions cannot be taken off the table,” Perman said in the video.
At their previous meeting in May, the regents approved a resolution that allows presidents of individual campuses to implement furloughs and temporary salary reductions as part of their budget plans.
Universities told they should brace for the coming year’s 7% budget cut

Senior Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance Ellen Herbst said 60% of the system’s operating costs are personnel-related. Two-thirds of the system’s employees are funded by state support, Herbst said, while about a quarter are funded by federal grants and contracts.
She said though universities are looking to low-impact actions to address personnel costs first, such as eliminating vacancies and allowing “natural attrition” to reduce payrolls, those actions alone may not be enough.
“We will take these actions with great care, but we will need to take some further actions,” Herbst said. “We cannot address the shortfall in state funding without addressing personnel costs.”
Patrick Moran, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Maryland Council 3, which represents more than 6,000 University System employees, said the union and system need to work together to defend their shared values and protect employees as they face “very real and critical threats.” Moran said the system must evaluate its use of costly vendors, reduce reliance on contractual employees, and listen to feedback from staff on how things can be better run.
“All of these things can be done before deciding to make devastating cuts to your personnel, especially those on the front lines,” he said.
Katherine Wasdin, a representative of the University of Maryland, College Park’s American Association of University Professors chapter, expressed the importance of shared governance as the system makes its budget decisions.

“Faculty and university senates must be involved in making these difficult budgetary decisions, as well as in how to respond to changing federal policies on education and research,” Wasdin, an associate professor of classics, said. “It is thus imperative that all parts of the USM system promote the involvement of faculty in university management, rather than trying to thwart it.”
Under the budget plan, the University System will receive 29% of its funding from state appropriations, while 27% will come from tuition and fees. The next largest contribution comes from restricted funds, which consist mostly of federal contracts and grants, and will cover about 24% of the budget.
In addition to the reduction in state funding, the system estimates that the federal government’s significant cuts to research grants and contracts could cost up to $150 million across its campuses, Herbst said.
To increase revenue to offset the losses in funding, tuition will increase across the system by 2-4% for in-state residents. The University of Maryland, College Park will see the highest increase at 4%, while the rest will see increases of 3% or less.
Tuition for nonresident undergrads will increase by 5% at Towson and UMBC, and 2% at the system’s other institutions.
Regents committee calls for OK of $69 million for time to pull back spun-off businesses

Student fees, such as housing, dining and parking, will see bigger increases. Housing will see increases from 2% at Towson to 10% at Bowie State University, while board fee increases range from 2.2% at Salisbury University to 10.5% at College Park.
Bowie State University and the College Park campus will also raise parking fees by 3.8% and 5%, respectively.
The regents also voted Friday to approve extending the University of Maryland Global Campus’s contract with UMGC Ventures, the university’s former in-house information technology services unit which it turned into an independent business.
The online university will spend $69 million on the 18-month contract extension while it works to reintegrate Ventures and AccelerEd, a subsidiary of Ventures, back into the university. The reintegration comes after an August 2024 audit from the state’s Office of Legislative Audits that found the spin-offs were too costly and appeared to bypass the school’s normal procedures.
Herbst said that staff across the University System are continuously drawing up contingency plans for budget scenarios they could face later in the year, such as lower-than-expected enrollment, further federal funding cuts or change to eligibility for federal financial aid.
Pell Grants, the system’s largest source of financial aid, covered more than $204 million in aid for about 45,000 students in fiscal 2024. More than 58,000 students in total received some form of federal student aid, Herbst added, and any significant eligibility changes could potentially impact enrollment numbers.
“All we know for sure about budgets is they’re simply a plan, and then the year starts and we have to actually manage,” she said. “This year will probably prove to be more challenging than many.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/file-8466-1024x690.jpg,,,2025-06-14 00:57:55.783031

Grier Hopkins, D-Fairbanks, speaks on the floor of the Alaska House, Wednesday, May 18, 2022. Hopkins is now the mayor of the Fairbanks North Star Borough. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)One day after Gov. Mike Dunleavy made a precedent-setting veto by cutting funding for the state’s public school education formula, a group of city and borough leaders denounced the decision during a joint news conference, with some saying that they expect a lawsuit to challenge it.
“Everybody needs to start talking about what a lawsuit looks like,” said Rozlyn Grady-Wyche, a member of the Mountain View Community Council in Anchorage. 
Caroline Storm, of the Coalition for Education Equity, has been talking about a lawsuit for more than a year. On Friday, she said the coalition “will file or be a partner in a lawsuit before next session, because it doesn’t seem that between the Legislature and the governor, that they are capable of meeting their constitutional obligation to adequately fund public education.”
State lawmakers this year voted for a bill that increases the base student allocation, core of the state’s per-student funding formula, by $700 per student, overriding a Dunleavy veto in the process.
But that formula is subject to the state’s annual budget process, in separate legislation. If the formula is a bucket, the budget decides how full that bucket is.
Until now, lawmakers and the governor have filled that bucket to capacity each year. This year, one of Dunleavy’s vetoes took $200 per student from that bucket, cutting about $50.6 million statewide.
For municipal officials, it’s a significant problem because the ordinary local budget process is over, meaning that they will have to reopen their budgets and make additional cuts to public education. 
In some cases, those cuts will come atop school closures — including in Fairbanks, Anchorage, Kodiak and the Kenai Peninsula Borough — and other cuts that were already planned.
“It’s a crisis for our state, and that’s why we’re all here today,” said Fairbanks North Star Borough Mayor Grier Hopkins during the joint news conference.
On Thursday night, the Anchorage School Board voted to implement an immediate hiring freeze while it addresses the veto. 
The board had budgeted for a $560 BSA increase, thinking it was being cautious. Now that there’s a $500 increase instead, ASD facing a $4.3 million budget gap.
“I cannot even imagine where $4.3 million is going to come from,” said Margo Bellamy, vice president of the ASD board.
Kenai Peninsula Borough Mayor Peter Micciche, R-Soldotna, said the veto has a “fairly significant impact” in his borough, where voters may be asked to pick up the slack.
“This is essentially a tax shift. It’s the state not meeting a constitutional expectation requirement, if you will,” he said. 
Penny Vadla, treasurer of the Kenai Peninsula Borough school board, said the impacts in her area will be largest in sparsely populated places.
“We’re closing theaters, we’re losing library aides in some places where that means that library in a small school will close down,” she said. “The impact on larger schools is that they might become larger without the capacity to put more students in that building.”
State legislators could override Dunleavy’s cuts, but Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, and Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, said they don’t expect that lawmakers will be available until the 2026 Alaska Legislature begins in January.
“I’ll certainly be getting on my phone and hitting the streets to urge our legislators here, in the borough, the Interior delegation, to override the veto,” Hopkins said.
Micciche was critical of legislators’ slow pace. 
Before becoming mayor, Micciche served as Senate president. Lawmakers, and particularly the presiding officers of the House and Senate, should have already scheduled a special session to consider a veto override, he said.
“You knew that there was going to be a second swipe by the governor,” Micciche said. 
If the Legislature stays on the sidelines, that would leave legal action as the only recourse for Alaskans seeking a quick reversal of the governor’s action.
Any legal argument is expected to revolve around the question of whether or not the governor’s veto violates the Alaska Constitution’s education clause.
“The Alaska Constitution clearly states that the legislators shall, by general law, establish and maintain a system of public schools open to all children of the state, so that language creates a constitutional obligation to provide adequate and equitable public education,” said Grady-Wyche. 
“If the state fails to meet this obligation by consistently underfunding schools, closing essential programs and/or making access inequitable across regions, it can be legally challenged in court,” she said.
Storm, of the Coalition for Education Equity, has been watching the governor and Legislature closely for years and talking with other education groups in the meantime. The coalition is a nonprofit that has successfully sued to increase state school funding in the past.
Storm said she sees a national pattern at work, with conservative and limited-government groups and officials attempting to favor charter schools over traditional public schools.
“This is a coordinated attack on public education as a whole, as part of a national trend, or as Project 2025 — one hundred percent — and parents need to really start thinking about what’s going to happen when public education goes away, and what that means for their kid, because it’s not going to be pretty,” she said.
Storm wasn’t in the news conference with municipal officials, who focused on the local consequences of funding — or not — public education.
Micciche, who said he’s “not a courtroom guy,” cautioned that any lawsuit comes with risks: What happens if the plaintiffs lose?
“You can get a ruling; it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re going to get an outcome,” he said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska House Judiciary Committee plans to hold a hearing June 20 on the use of Alaska Department of Corrections facilities to house and supervise federal detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The announcement comes following news of DOC holding 42 people arrested and detained by ICE from out of state over the weekend, housed at the Anchorage Correctional Complex, amid a nationwide immigration crackdown. 
DOC is currently housing 39 ICE detainees, according to a department spokesperson on Friday. 
Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, chair of the judiciary committee, said the goal is to gather information on the terms and conditions of detention for the state detaining people for ICE.  
“It’s really more a fact-finding hearing just to make sure that we understand exactly what’s happening in a situation that, to my knowledge, hasn’t happened before,” Gray said in a phone interview Thursday.
“Some of the concerns that we have that we’re just curious to learn more about are how much contact they have with their families, with legal representation, and access to medical care,” he said. “Those sorts of things are things that we want to make sure that they have.”
The hearing is planned for June 20 at 1 p.m. at the Anchorage Legislative Information Office, and will be streamed live on the Legislature’s website and Gavel Alaska. The committee has invited officials with the Department of Corrections, Department of Law, the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska and attorneys representing several of the men to present.
Gray pointed to immigration status as a civil legal issue, and not a criminal one. “And my limited understanding of what’s happening in DOC right now with these detainees is that they are not being afforded those additional rights and freedoms that would come to someone who would be at an ICE detention facility,” he said.
ICE has not responded to multiple requests for comment, including on what criminal or civil charges are being brought against the men.
One man being held in Alaska custody, Albert Khamitov, was granted asylum by an immigration judge for “’clear evidence of state sponsored persecution’ of LGBTQ+ people in Russia,” the Seattle Times has reported. The U.S. government appealed that asylum decision and he has remained in detention while fighting the case.

Gray said he’s been speaking with several attorneys representing the men currently detained, who have raised the issue of whether they are receiving adequate translation services while in Alaska custody. Gray said he’s been told DOC staff are using Google Translate to communicate with detainees, which he said is inadequate. 
“​​I want to hear from DOC, I want them to talk about how they’re handling this issue. But the fear is that folks have been removed to Alaska, cannot communicate with the people who are, you know, managing them, and have no way of contacting their friends and family from where they came,” he said. “I just can’t imagine what that must be like for them. So I hope that my fear is unfounded.”
DOC spokesperson Betsy Holley said Friday via email that the department is using translation services. “We have long had, and utilize professional translation services: Language Link, Language Line Services, Alaska Interpreting Alliance, and Big Language Solutions,” she said. “Additionally, we have many bilingual staff members. The facility chooses the service based on availability at the time the need arises.”
The department did not respond to requests for comment on the concerns around conditions of detention, access to communication with families and attorneys, as well as access to medical care, by Friday at 4 p.m. 
Gray said he’s also concerned about the state’s risk for potential litigation around standards of detention. 
“Our facilities were not designed for this. Our personnel were not trained for this,” Gray said. “My fear is that there’s going to be some very well-founded litigation about these folks being here that the state is going to have to pay for. It is not going to break even. This is going to end up costing Alaska a lot of money, is my fear.”
Questions remain around why the men were transferred to Alaska from the Tacoma ICE Detention Facility, as two men were transferred back to Washington state within one day, according to the Department of Corrections. 
“There are rights that are guaranteed to people in the United States, regardless of their immigration status, a person cannot be incarcerated without knowing what the charges are against them, without the right to legal representation, without the right to defend themselves,” Gray said. “I have fear that these folks aren’t being awarded these rights as they should be, but I will reserve judgment.”

(Courtesy of the Governor's Office)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen has activated the Nebraska National Guard ahead of scheduled protests this weekend. 
Late Friday, the governor issued an emergency proclamation that activated the Guard and prepared Guard and state law enforcement resources for immediate deployment if needed, a governor’s spokeswoman confirmed. 
Typical National Guard activation can take up to 24 hours, but the proclamation shortens that time.
Nebraska has seen several protests in recent days over a federal immigration raid that hit an Omaha food plant, in what immigration officials said was the largest Nebraska enforcement operation since President Donald Trump took office.
Most of the protests have been peaceful – though federal officials arrested four protesters from the original raid site, Glenn Valley Foods, alleging “aggressive” behavior damage to federal property. 
Pillen and Nebraska joined other states with conservative governors, such as Texas and Missouri, that have activated their National Guard in advance of planned protests. Texas has deployed 5,000 Guard members.
Pillen formally declared a state of emergency to activate the Guard so it can assist local law enforcement should any demonstrations escalate. 
“Free speech will be respected and protected in Nebraska,” Pillen said. “But the lawlessness, chaos, and rioting seen in other cities in past weeks will not be tolerated here.” 
Pillen said he took the steps to boost “security and order” for the visitors of the College World Series in Omaha, the NCAA’s baseball championships, and across the state. 
“Any person who poses a threat to life, health, or property will be arrested,” Pillen wrote in his emergency proclamation.
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, in a post on Facebook, called the Governor’s emergency declaration an “extreme overreach” and an attempt to silence dissent.” 
“This is not leadership,” Spivey said. “It’s fear-mongering.” 
The heartland protests come against the backdrop of larger, tenser protests in Los Angeles as a result of ICE raids there over the past week. 
The Trump administration and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have been butting heads as Trump federalized and then deployed 4,000 members of the California National Guard and 700 Marines to the second-largest U.S. city in response to protests without the permission from the Democratic governor. 
Newsom responded by accusing Trump of choosing “theatrics over public safety’ and escalating the “chaos.” The California Governor sued the Trump Administration over the deployment of the state National Guard. 
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers this week joined 18 other Republican attorneys general in a brief in support of Trump’s deployment of National Guard, arguing that Trump has the “authority” to do so. 
“We stand with law enforcement, we support President Trump’s action, and we will not let chaos take hold in our states,” Hilger said in a joint statement. 
Los Angeles has sparked similar protests in Texas, New York City, Chicago, and other Democratic-leaning parts of the country. More protests are planned nationally against Trump this weekend, including in Nebraska, part of the ‘No King’ protests, as Trump plans a military parade to celebrate the Army’s anniversary in Washington D.C, and Flag Day on Saturday, both of which overlap with his 79th birthday.  
Organizers behind the nationwide ‘No King’ protests include Indivisible, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the 50501 Movement. Organizers have branded Saturday as a “day of defiance” against what they call authoritarian overreach by the Trump administration. 
There are 13 planned protests around Nebraska, including Lincoln,  Omaha and Hastings.

Complaint argues that the state funding private education violates the Wyoming Constitution in two key ways.
The post Wyoming Education Association files lawsuit to stop school voucher payments appeared first on WyoFile .","Nine parents of school-aged children and the Wyoming Education Association, which represents more than 6,000 of the state’s public school employees, filed a lawsuit Friday challenging the constitutionality of the state’s education savings account program instituted by the Wyoming Legislature.
The program, which lawmakers created in 2024 and significantly expanded during their time in Cheyenne this year, will give up to $7,000 per K-12 student to Wyoming families annually to pay for private education costs.
The WEA’s complaint argues that the program violates the Wyoming Constitution in two key ways. One for directing public dollars to private enterprises, which the lawsuit says is clearly prohibited. The second for violating the constitution’s mandate that Wyoming provide “a complete and uniform system of education.” 
The program puts kids at risk of falling behind while wasting tax dollars on unqualified operators, Kim Amen, president of WEA, told WyoFile in a phone interview Friday. 
Proponents of the education savings accounts, also known as a voucher program, argue it gives parents more choices in educating their children and offers the smallest rural communities options to bring schools in if they don’t qualify for public school investments by the state.
The constitutional arguments in the lawsuit echo those made repeatedly by the program’s opponents during recent statehouse debates over its expansion — one of the most controversial topics of the 2025 legislative session. The debate also brought interest and action from national school choice organizations to Cheyenne.
“They were told over and over that this was unconstitutional and they chose to pass it anyway,” Amen said.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder and State Treasurer Curt Meier are named as defendants alongside the state. Meier is named because WEA is seeking a court injunction to stop the disbursement of funds by the treasurer. Degenfelder supported the program and is failing to uphold the state’s public education system, Amen contended Friday. A department of education spokesperson did not immediately respond to a voicemail seeking comment on the lawsuit late Friday afternoon.
House Education Chairman Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie, a chief proponent of the school voucher legislation, told WyoFile on Friday he did not think the lawsuit would succeed, based on similar cases in other states. 
“Legal challenges like this are expected whenever bold school choice programs are implemented,” he said. “Wyoming’s ESA program was crafted carefully to withstand this kind of scrutiny, and we’re confident it will stand.”
The new lawsuit opens a second major front in legal battles between public schools and the increasingly conservative legislature, which has constrained public education funding while promoting the growth of privately run charter schools in Wyoming. The lawsuit directly challenges the Legislature’s expansion this past session of its voucher program, which provides public funds to cover private education costs. 
But in Friday’s complaint, the WEA’s attorneys linked that voucher program to what they called lawmakers’ failure to fund public education to the high standards Wyoming’s constitution dictates. Educators notched a sweeping legal victory in February — during the legislative session — in a lawsuit over that case, when a district court judge ordered lawmakers to reexamine the public school funding model.
“While the ink was still drying on the District Court’s decision, the Wyoming Legislature … greatly expanded the existing Voucher Program to all students in Wyoming,” the complaint reads. 
The state has appealed the school funding case to the Wyoming Supreme Court, which has not yet taken up the matter. 
The WEA will continue to challenge the Legislature in court if lawmakers pass bills that the organization considers unconstitutional and detrimental to public schools, Amen said. 
“The voucher school program disproportionately benefits wealthy families,” she said. “We remain committed to defending our public educators, students and families. Public dollars belong in public schools.”

CHICAGO — The number of years former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan spent in Springfield has often been used as shorthand to explain his outsized impact on state government and politics. His political career spanned 50 years in the General Assembly, 23 years chairing the Democratic Party of Illinois, and 36 years as House speaker — the longest tenure of any state or federal legislative leader in U.S. history.

But on Friday, a new term was added to the former speaker’s list of legacy-defining terms when U.S. District Judge John Blakey sentenced Madigan to 90 months, or 7 ½ years, in federal prison.

The sentence, which also includes three years’ probation after his prison term and a $2.5 million fine, follows a jury’s split verdict in February. After a marathon two weeks of deliberation, jurors convicted him on 10 of 23 corruption charges, including bribery, but acquitted him on seven and deadlocked over another six.

As Friday afternoon’s hearing passed the three-hour mark, Madigan accepted Blakey’s invitation to make a statement to the court. After taking a drink of water, putting on his glasses and blowing his nose as he approached the bench, the former speaker addressed the judge for less than two minutes, reading from a prepared script.

“I’m truly sorry for putting the people of the state of Illinois through this,” he began, noting that he “tried my best” to serve the people of Illinois. “I am not perfect.”

Later, when explaining how he was weighing Madigan’s continued insistence in his innocence, Blakey repeated Madigan’s words.

“The defendant says he’s sorry for putting the people of Illinois through this,” the judge said. “I guess that’s as close as we’ll get to remorse.”

Blakey spent a long time audibly weighing what he called “a tale of two different Mike Madigans,” calling the former speaker “a dedicated public servant” and “a good and decent person.”

“He had no reason to commit these crimes,” the judge said. “But he chose to do so.”

Blakey took particular umbrage with Madigan’s performance on the witness stand in January after he made the stunning decision to testify in his own defense. In siding with the government’s argument that the former speaker’s sentence should take into account his perjury on the witness stand, Blakey cited several examples of times Madigan’s statements conflicted with either evidence, the sworn testimony of others, or even his own testimony.

“The defendant’s testimony was littered with obstruction of justice and it was hard to watch,” Blakey said. “To put it bluntly, it was a nauseating display. ... You lied, sir. You lied. You did not have to.”

Madigan, who was described by many witnesses throughout his four-month trial as difficult to read — and who attempted to explain the familial origins of his reserved personality as a defense while on the witness stand — was characteristically stoic as Blakey handed down his sentence.

After conferring with his attorney, he hugged and kissed his adult children in the front row of the courtroom gallery. A few minutes later, he and his entourage of lawyers and family quickly made their way out of the Dirksen Federal Courthouse, trailed by cameras.

True to form, the former speaker also made no statement to reporters, though he smiled slightly before getting on the elevator down to the courthouse lobby. Across the street, a man yelled to Madigan and his group, “You going to jail, buddy?”

Madigan was ordered to report to a yet-to-be-named federal prison on Oct. 13.

Prosecutors had urged a 12 ½-year sentence and a $1.5 million fine, while Madigan’s lawyers asked for five years’ probation, the first on home detention. After hearing arguments from attorneys earlier in the week, Blakey calculated the sentencing guidelines for Madigan’s convictions and other factors would dictate a prison term of 105 years, but the judge was under no obligation to follow that directive.

‘I’m not a target of anything”

One of the last times the famously media-averse Madigan ever deigned to answer questions from journalists was in the fall of 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic afforded the speaker an even larger buffer than usual from those outside his closed circle of staff and advisors.

The previous several months had yielded near-weekly developments in the public’s understanding of an unfolding federal corruption probe, including revelations about FBI searches executed on the homes of close Madigan allies. The intrigue only intensified after the indictment and midday FBI raids on two different Democratic state senators and the arrest of a member of Madigan’s own House Democratic leadership team on a charge that he bribed another Democratic senator, who happened to be cooperating with the feds.

Despite his name showing up on subpoenas for some of those search warrants, Madigan made a bold declaration that he was not in the feds’ crosshairs.

“No, I’m not a target of anything,” he told a gaggle of reporters in a crowded and noisy hallway of the state Capitol in Springfield in late October 2019.

Within the year, however, Madigan would be proven wrong as prosecutors filed the first in a series of bombshell charges alleging the longtime speaker had been the beneficiary of a yearslong bribery scheme from electric utility Commonwealth Edison. Prosecutors alleged ComEd officials agreed to hire Madigan allies, including a handful on no-work contracts, to grease the wheels at key times when the company was pushing for big and ultimately lucrative legislation in Springfield.

In that July 2020 filing, Madigan’s status as a target of the feds’ widespread corruption investigation was marked by a new moniker: “Public Official A.”

But it wasn’t until March 2022 — more than a year after Madigan resigned from his biggest public roles after pressure from within the Democratic power structures he’d built over decades — that the former speaker was indicted.

Receiving top billing among the original 22 counts in the indictment, which was later bumped to 23, was racketeering. Prosecutors accused Madigan of using his positions as House speaker, chair of the state’s Democratic Party and as partner in his real estate law firm as a “criminal enterprise” meant to maintain and increase his power while enriching his allies.

The indictment rehashed what had been already made public in July 2020 and again several months later when four former ComEd executives and lobbyists were charged with orchestrating the utility’s bribery scheme aimed at Madigan.

But it also revealed that former Chicago Ald. Danny Solis had worn a wire on the speaker and alleged the speaker had agreed to get him appointed to a lucrative state board position in exchange for introductions to real estate developers to woo them as potential clients of Madigan’s firm.

A final charge added later in 2022 alleged a tacit bribery agreement between Madigan and telecommunications giant AT&T Illinois like the ComEd scheme, albeit smaller — involving one no-work contractor hired in the months before AT&T-backed legislation passed in Springfield.

Jury delivers a split verdict

On the witness stand, Madigan repeatedly claimed that he was ignorant of the fact that the collective $1.3 million his allies earned from their ComEd contracts was for performing no work. Instead, the former speaker and his lawyers framed those contracts as the result of mere job recommendations, which they argued was a component of Madigan’s job as speaker.

Madigan’s attorneys, along with some of the government’s own witnesses, argued the ComEd-backed legislation passed after years of strategic and expensive lobbying efforts, and not because the speaker’s allies had gotten jobs and contracts with the utility.

But after a slew of witnesses, including a ComEd exec-turned-FBI cooperator and one of the former contractors, in addition to secretly recorded videos and wiretapped phone calls shown at trial, the jury was ultimately convinced on most ComEd-related charges. Madigan was convicted on seven of those charges, including four counts of bribery and conspiracy, though he was acquitted on two charges related to an effort to get his ally appointed to the utility’s board.

The so-called “ComEd Four” were convicted in their own trial in 2023 and are scheduled to be sentenced this summer. They include Madigan’s formerly close friend and longtime Springfield lobbyist Mike McClain, who was also the speaker’s codefendant in the most recent trial. But after roughly 65 hours of deliberations over two weeks beginning in late January, the jury deadlocked on all six charges that named both the former speaker and McClain, including the feds’ marquee racketeering allegation.

The jury also deadlocked on the single count alleging Madigan’s participation in the alleged bribery scheme with AT&T, forcing Blakey to declare a mistrial on that count.

It was the second time in five months that charges alleging a bribe between AT&T and Madigan resulted in a hung jury; weeks before Madigan’s trial began, former AT&T Illinois President Paul La Schiazza’s bribery case ended in a mistrial on all five counts against him. He faces retrial in January 2026.

Charges involving Solis, the former Chicago alderman, ended in a mix of convictions, acquittals and deadlock from the jury. While jurors convicted the former speaker on wire fraud and Travel Act violation counts related to the alleged scheme to help get Solis appointed to a state board, they acquitted him of the bribery charge pertaining to the same alleged scheme. As laid out in trial, Madigan never ended up recommending Solis to newly elected Gov. JB Pritzker.

The former speaker was also acquitted of attempted extortion and three related counts related to a real estate developer to whom Madigan wanted an introduction from Solis, who served as chair of the Chicago City Council’s powerful Zoning Board. Prosecutors alleged Madigan understood and tacitly approved of Solis’ made-up story that he’d condition the approval of a zoning change sought by the developer on whether it agreed to hire the speaker’s law firm.

At the FBI’s direction, Solis told the speaker ahead of the July 2017 introduction meeting that the developer understood “how this works, you know, the quid pro quo” — insinuating the company was under the impression that it would not get the zoning approvals it needed unless it hired the speaker’s law firm, though it wasn’t true.

A few weeks later, Madigan admonished Solis before the developer meeting, telling the alderman, “You shouldn’t be talking like that.”

Danny Solis secretly recorded at the direction of the FBI at the speaker’s law offices in July 2017. (Video screenshot from government exhibits shown Nov. 25, 2024)[/caption]



The feds argued Madigan was urging Solis to not speak so brazenly about their alleged bribery agreement. But on the witness stand, the former speaker said the alderman’s use of the term “quid pro quo” caused him “a great deal of surprise and concern” to the point that he decided he needed to confront Solis about it face-to-face.

In Madigan’s contentious cross-examination, the lead prosecutor attempted to poke holes in the former speaker’s explanation of that key moment, but Madigan maintained Solis seemed to have recognized he’d “made a serious mistake” and that he considered the matter settled because “I was not going to connect a request for an introduction with anything else.""

The jury also deadlocked on four other bribery, wire fraud and Travel Act charges concerning a plan to get state-owned land in Chicago’s Chinatown neighborhood transferred to the city for eventual development into a mixed-use apartment building.

Prosecutors alleged Madigan intended to have his firm contract with the Chinatown developer in accordance with hints Solis had dropped on secret recordings. But Madigan’s former law partner and testimony from two former top lawyers in the speaker’s office indicated the law firm had strict conflict-of-interest rules that would have prohibited the developer from ever becoming a client.

Sentencing factors

In the four months post-verdict, a period nearly as long as the grueling trial itself, Madigan turned 83 — a mitigating factor his defense attorneys noted in a pre-sentencing memo late last month, which asked for five years’ probation, including one on home confinement.

In another filing last week, Madigan’s lawyers painted a bleak picture of the sentence sought by prosecutors, accusing them of arguing in bad faith that ComEd’s investor profits should be considered as part of sentencing.

“The government seeks to condemn an 83-year-old man to die behind bars for crimes that enriched him not one penny,” defense attorneys wrote. “They demand that Mike Madigan spend his final years in a cell, though he spent decades as the consumers’ shield against ComEd’s predations.”

But much more emphasized was his role as caretaker to his wife, Shirley, who suffers from “a severe lung disease,” per a letter filed with the court last month from Madigan’s daughter, former Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan.

Instead of writing a letter, Shirley Madigan recorded a video pleading for leniency in sentencing. Clad in purple latex gloves with a medical mask hanging from her neck, Shirley praised her husband’s character as a father and grandfather but also detailed how Madigan has become her caretaker, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic hit.



[caption id=""attachment_70951"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1140""] Instead of a letter, former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan’s wife, Shirley, submitted a video pleading for leniency ahead of the ex-speaker's sentencing June 13. Shirley detailed her chronic lung disease has made her medically fragile and forced her husband to take on the role of caretaker. (Video screenshot from exhibit filed to federal court docket on June 6, 2025)[/caption]



“I really don’t exist without him,” she told the camera as B-roll of Madigan helping her up from a couch played over her testimonial. “I don’t know what I would do without Michael. I would probably have to find some place to live, and I’d probably have to find care.”

The former speaker and his lawyers echoed Shirley’s pleas Friday, with attorney Dan Collins telling Blakey that for Madigan, “mercy is justice,” and Madigan himself asking the judge that “you let me take care of Shirley and that you let me spend my final days with my family.”

Blakey said Madigan’s age was a factor, but said arguments that “any sentence” for an older defendant is tantamount to a life sentence are “not particularly helpful.”

But the judge said he carefully considered the nearly 250 character reference letters filed on Madigan’s behalf late last month, saying he “placed significant weight” on the support of the former speaker’s family and friends.

He even got emotional when discussing Madigan’s role as a husband, father and grandfather.

“Whatever his crimes — and he did do things wrong — but his relationship to his family? He got that right,” Blakey said, echoing words the former speaker told Solis during a secretly recorded meeting between the two in 2018.

Aside from family, other notable letter-writers on Madigan’s behalf included former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun; former Illinois Supreme Court Justice Tom Kilbride; Democratic mega-fundraisers Michael Sacks and Fred Eychaner, and Chicago Bulls and White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf. While many former Democratic allies of Madigan penned appeals to Judge Blakey, only a few currently hold office — among them state Reps. Marcus Evans, D-Chicago, and Curtis Tarver, D-Chicago, along with Auditor General Frank Mautino.

In determining sentencing guidelines, Blakey agreed with prosecutors’ contention that the value of the ComEd bribes should be based on testimony from utility leader Scott Vogt during trial. Vogt cited projections that the continuation of the “formula rate” contained in the first piece of ComEd-backed legislation passed during the eight-year bribery scheme was worth $400 million in increased shareholder value for the company.

The judge also agreed with smaller sentencing enhancements, for defendants who orchestrate bribery schemes, and for lying under oath while testifying in their own defense.

Blakey gave several examples of times in which Madigan perjured himself during his four days on the witness stand, including the former speaker’s attempt to “falsely minimize the close and regular relationship he had with McClain.”

“Other witnesses testified to their unique and close relationship, which spanned decades,” Blakey said. “In short, the evidence produced at trial showed McClain was one of Madigan’s most-trusted operatives, not merely one of many, as he falsely testified.”

Ultimately, though, the judge’s ruling in favor of sentencing enhancements for perjury and other factors is mostly symbolic, as the parties already agreed to a sentence far below the complicated calculation that would advise a 105-year prison sentence.

Sentences handed down to other convicted politicians in Illinois’ long history of elected officials caught up in corruption have varied widely.

Last year, a federal judge sentenced Madigan’s pseudo-counterpart in the Chicago City Council, five-decade Ald. Ed Burke, to two years in prison after his bribery conviction that also involved Solis’ FBI cooperation in bringing potential clients to Burke’s real estate law firm. The judge noted the number of character letters she received on the former alderman’s behalf were a strong mitigating factor in her sentencing decision.

On the other end of the spectrum, Gov. Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison after his 2011 bribery convictions related to attempting to sell then-President-elect Barack Obama’s soon-to-be-vacated U.S. Senate seat in 2008. President Donald Trump commuted his sentence in 2020, and in February pardoned him completely — just two days before Madigan’s conviction.

(Photo by Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)Estimates from the Sierra Club found Iowa utilities would be allowed to release 26 million tons of carbon emissions annually, if the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized a proposal to repeal carbon pollution standards. 
In its explanation for the proposal, EPA claims greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired plants “do not contribute significantly” to dangerous air pollution and that removing pollution standards set by the agency under previous administrations would save $19 billion in regulatory costs over two decades. 
The Sierra Club, which is an environmental organization with chapters across the country, said the power sector is the largest stationary source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. and that exposure to these air pollutants are linked to a higher risk of heart disease, respiratory diseases, pregnancy complications and cancer.

“The Trump Administration continues to put the American people at risk by stripping away environmental safeguards proven to clean up the air we breathe and improve public health,” Pam Mackey Taylor, director of the Iowa Chapter of the Sierra Club, said in a statement. 
The proposal would repeal regulations put in place in 2015 and in 2024 that put emission guidelines and standards on coal-fired power plants, via Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. 
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s proposal argues the Clean Air Act requires the agency to determine, before it issues regulations, that pollutants emitted by fossil fuel-fired power plants “causes, or contributes significantly to, air pollution” that is “anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” 
The current administration argues EPA in the past created regulation standards without this determination. 
EPA data shows that 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 came from the power sector, which was just slightly less than the transportation sector which accounted for 28% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. 
In an EPA presentation explaining the rules which were finalized in July 2024, the agency estimated the additional carbon pollution standards would have cut 617 million metric tons of carbon dioxide and other “harmful air pollutants that are known to endanger public health.” 
Sierra Club charted the impacts these regulations would have had, state-by-state based on operating coal-powered plants and their estimated closure dates.
EPA regulations around carbon pollution standards for the power sector have been challenged in the past, most recently with a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court case that repealed part of the 2015 Clean Power Plan emission guidelines. 
The proposal to repeal the most recent rules alleges Biden-era EPA leadership did not change course following the Supreme Court ruling, but created similar, rules with expanded regulations. 
Acting under a handful of executive orders from President Donald Trump, and Zeldin’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative, the agency seeks to repeal “all” greenhouse gas emission standards on the power sector, or alternatively, just the “most burdensome set of requirements.” 
The notice said this will “ensure affordable and reliable energy supplies and drive down the costs of transportation, heating, utilities, farming, and manufacturing while boosting our national security.” 
The proposal will have a public hearing 15 days after it is published in the Federal Register, where EPA will also accept public comments on the proposed rules 45 days after it is published. Those interested can search for the docket in the federal register with Docket ID number: EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0124. 
“During the public comment period, we will continue to fight for clean air and protect our communities being harmed by Trump’s shortsighted actions,” Mackey Taylor said.

After a week of stalled negotiations between House and Senate members over private school funding, compromise prevailed. But the bill — a generational transformation of Vermont’s education system — still requires a majority vote in both chambers.

MONTPELIER—After days of stagnated negotiations, a group of lawmakers and Gov. Phil Scott reached a compromise on the year’s landmark education reform bill. 
Loaded with caveats, the proposal would consolidate school districts, create a new education funding formula, impose class-size minimums and reimagine income-sensitive property tax relief. Those changes, however, would take place over many years and only if a number of contingencies are met.
While Friday’s compromise represented a significant breakthrough, the legislation still requires a majority vote in the House and Senate — far from a done deal on what’s become a proposal filled with policies that are unpopular for some Democrats and Republicans. 
“I’m happy to say we’ve reached an agreement,” Scott said at his weekly press conference Friday afternoon, adding that his team would work with legislative Republicans over the weekend to explain the legislation. 
The three senators and three representatives who’ve spent weeks negotiating a compromise shook hands soon after Scott’s announcement, eliciting applause from legislative leaders and staff looking on.
“All of us compromised a lot to get here,” Sen. Seth Bongartz, D-Bennington, chair of the Senate Education Committee and chair of the conference committee, told his fellow conferees. 
The Legislature will return Monday, when it intends to wrap up the year’s business — including voting on the changes to the education reform bill proposed by the conference committee.
In the meantime, lawmakers are in for a busy weekend. Democratic and Republican leadership, as well as the Scott administration, will need to explain the 155-page bill to their colleagues and attempt to build support. 
With such a wide-ranging proposal, there’s lots for lawmakers to dislike. Some have argued the bill spends too much. Others say it underfunds schools. Some fear it will gut rural school districts and shutter small schools. Still others argue it shifts too much power out of local hands and into Montpelier. 
Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, who leads the Senate Republicans, said he’d start calling his colleagues tomorrow. 
“I think the conversation will definitely start with a lot of ‘no’s,’” he said in an interview. “There are things in this bill I don’t like. I would have certainly done it differently. But there are tax savings in here for Vermonters.”
Scott too acknowledged the challenge ahead in getting a majority behind the proposal. 
“I don’t believe this is a slam dunk by any stretch,” he said. “There will be Republicans that won’t vote for it, and there’ll be Democrats who won’t vote for it as well.”

The details
The bill, H.454, referred to by the governor and lawmakers as the “education transformation proposal,” is replete with unknowns and contingencies, and requires years of phase-ins and -outs before it takes full effect. 
After last year’s double-digit average increases in education property taxes, both Scott, a Republican, and the Legislature’s top Democrats vowed to reform Vermont’s education system. But while agreement existed in the abstract, the details proved far harder to hash out. Even after more than five months of work, coming out with a bill that both chambers and the governor could support never looked certain. 
Friday’s compromise, a product of hours of public meetings and even more backroom negotiations, lays the groundwork for generational change to the state’s public education and property tax systems.
In the broadest terms, the proposal would consolidate Vermont’s more than 100 school districts into larger, regional bodies, and move the state to a new education funding formula, a combination that Scott’s team says will save hundreds of millions after fully implemented. 
The state will gradually pivot to funding its education using a foundation formula. The method — used in most states across the country — moves primary authority over how much school districts can spend from the local to the state level. Districts receive money based on the number of students enrolled, with additional dollars for students who are more expensive to educate, such as English learners and students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. 
To ease the whiplash of transitioning to the new formula, lawmakers designed a gradual transition. In effect, that would phase in tax increases for districts that currently spend well below average, and slowly pull back funding from districts that spend well above average now. Plus, lawmakers hope a new property tax break structure will moderate the impact for most Vermont resident homeowners.
As written, H.454 would allow districts to spend more — but not less — than the foundation formula provides. That supplemental spending, which would need to be approved by school district voters, would start at a maximum of 10%, phasing down to 5% over time. 
The bill’s biggest unknown is what future consolidated school districts could look like. A task force will hash out not more than three possible configurations this summer that the legislature would need to vote on as soon as next session. 
Those districts, as well as the new funding formula, would take effect in 2028. 
Other key, outstanding details include how to handle existing district debt and different teachers contracts in new, consolidated districts. Lawmakers also need to figure out how to pay for — and bring down the cost of — special education, and how money would be allocated to career and technical education and pre-kindergarten. 
Without fulfilling future requirements, the transformation self-destructs. The foundation formula is contingent on creating consolidated school districts. Several aspects rely on future studies and the outcomes of those analyses.
The bill would put into effect class-size minimums in first grade through high school. But the enforcement of those minimums involve several caveats, and districts would need to be out of compliance for three years before facing even the possibility of repercussions. Plus, a waiver process would allow schools to petition for an exemption. 
Though the future school districts remain a huge unknown, the bill instructs the redistricting task force to compose districts of 4,000 to 8,000 students, though that range is approximate and only to “the extent practical.” Currently, only the Champlain Valley School District has more than 4,000 students.
The proposal would move Vermont away from a system of income-adjusted property tax credits. Instead, the framework would pivot to a homestead exemption that would allow homeowners making $115,000 or less to exempt up to $425,000 in property value from taxes. The exemption creates a sliding scale, with lower-income homeowners eligible for bigger exemptions. 
Negotiations stall, then a breakthrough 
Conferees spent the bulk of their time this week squabbling over issues around Vermont’s version of school choice, which allows students in towns that don’t operate public schools for some or all grades to use taxpayer money to attend either a public or private school. 
Up for debate: which private schools would be allowed to keep receiving public money, and how much control they would have over their tuition rates. 
Though private school regulations made up a tiny fraction of the bill — and only roughly 5% of Vermont’s publicly-funded students attend private schools — public versus private debates have long divided Vermont politicians.
At times, the conferees appeared legions apart. Thursday, as the House put forward a new proposal, its Democratic conferees appeared to draw a line in the sand.
“We have with this gone as far as we can and still have the support of our caucus,” Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, told Senate conferees.
She and Rep. Peter Conlon, D-Cornwall, chair of the House Education Committee, called for strict controls on which private schools can receive public money and how much money they can receive, arguing that private schools should face similar restrictions to those the bill proposes for public schools. 
At times, that line of thinking appeared a nonstarter for Senate members, mainly Bongartz and Beck, who argued in some cases for maintaining the status quo for Vermont’s most prominent private schools. 
Both senators have longstanding ties to those schools. Bongartz served as the board chair at Burr and Burton Academy. Beck works as a teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy. 
In particular, the senators pushed for a provision that would allow high schools that enroll publicly-funded students — both public and private receiving schools — to receive more money per student than lower-grade schools, arguing high school is more expensive. Some of the state’s private schools, like St. Johnsbury Academy and Burr and Burton, serve as the primary high school for local students, and Beck and Bongartz suggested that private high schools could cease to operate without the extra dollars. 
Both sides also failed for days to find compromise on how many private schools would still be eligible to receive public funds. The Senate had proposed regulations that they said would have cut the number more than in half, but the House conferees pushed for tighter restrictions. 
But in the end, lawmakers managed to meet in the middle. The bill proposes a significant winnowing of which private schools can receive public money. Those schools must meet a multipart test. First, they must exist in a school district that does not operate public schools for some grades, or in a supervisory union with school districts that fit that description. Next, the private school’s student body must have consisted of at least 25% publicly-funded students as of last year to continue to be eligible. 
The goal, lawmakers said, was to narrow eligibility only to those private schools that have functioned for years as a popular option in areas where no public school existed. 
Asked about how the Senate conferees ultimately found compromise, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, said in an interview that the House had met his chamber “more than halfway” on the issue of private schools. 
He described the state’s persistent fights over public money going to private schools as an “infected wound.”
“The wound, such as it is, is tiny, but the pain and the outrage and the way that people get worked up over it comes from this infected quality of the debate,” he said.

Anti-Trump rallies, under the ""no king"" banner are scheduled across the country Saturday, with dozens set for Maryland. (Photo by Sophie Park/Getty Images)For Ellie Rosenstock, the “No Kings” protest she is helping organize in Baltimore’s Patterson Park is as much about activists showing their support for each other as it is about showing their opposition to President Donald Trump and his policies.
“We want people to know that they are not alone, that they are represented, and even if we’re not all the same, we’re a broad coalition, and we’re going to be there for each other,” said Rosenstock, who was motivated to found Indivisible Baltimore last fall after Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump.
On Saturday, Rosenstock’s chapter of Indivisible — a national organization dedicated to opposing Trump and his policies — will be hosting one of an estimated 2,000 No Kings events that have been organized in communities across the U.S. More than 40 are planned across Maryland, from Friendsville to Elkton to Salisbury.
The protests come in response to rising numbers of warrantless immigration raids, Trump administration cuts to federal funding and jobs, reductions to health care spending and more, many of which Trump has tried to enact by executive order, circumventing Congress and the courts. In a statement Thursday, “No Kings” organizers said the protests aim to “reject authoritarian overreach.”
Rosenstock said the Baltimore event will be nonviolent and consist of speeches from local politicians, comedians, performances from singers and a peaceful march. It will be a “lovely, beautiful, beautiful day,” she said.
Organizers say thousands of Maryland residents are expected to gather across the state Saturday at dozens of these protests. Sites include Annapolis, Columbia, Bethesda, Silver Spring and Frederick, and the events will range from large protests to small gatherings to wave signs at highway overpasses.
Tanks, choppers descend on D.C. in prep for Army anniversary parade, Trump birthday

The date of the “nationwide day of defiance” was chosen to coincide with Trump’s planned military parade in Washington, D.C. to mark the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army’s founding. Saturday also happens to be Trump’s 79th birthday.
There will be no protest in Washington, D.C., organizers said, because they want to draw attention away from the city and the controversial parade. What is considered the flagship No Kings event is scheduled for Philadelphia.
Ruben Amaya, president of the Young Democrats of Maryland, said Trump’s military parade this Saturday is no way to honor democratic values.
“There’s better ways for us to show you know how great our country is than through a display of military force,” he said.
The planned demonstrations come just days after Trump deployed 700 Marines and mobilized more than 4,000 California National Guard troops to crack down on protests in downtown Los Angeles against an increase of ICE raids throughout the city.
The Maryland Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative state lawmakers, issued a statement Friday urging state and local leaders to take measures to ensure that the protests on Saturday do not “devolve into the same kind of chaos,” as in Los Angeles.
“What began as protests around ICE actions in Los Angeles has spiraled into riots, assaults, and destruction,” Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County), the caucus’s vice chair, said in the statement. “We support the right to protest peacefully, but no Marylander should have to fear for their family’s safety or their livelihood because of mob violence.”
In a statement on Wednesday, the Maryland State Police said it is in “constant contact” with other law enforcement partners regarding potential demonstrations this weekend, and will work to “address any public safety concerns while respecting the public’s First Amendment rights.”
No Kings organizers say they are dedicated to nonviolence. Weapons of any kind are banned from the events, and it says attendees are expected to  “seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events.”
Several organizers said that since the beginning of the second Trump administration, they’ve seen an uptick in grassroots activism.
Rosenstock said that since founding Indivisible Baltimore with just five people in January, the organization has grown to more than 2,000.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Tom Glancy, a co-organizer for the Baltimore County-based Allies for Democracy, said that “doing nothing is not an option.”
“We can’t cede the field to Trump and his allies, because they’ll just push things as far as they can,” Glancy said. “We need to step up, and one of the ways we do this is with these marches.”
Glancy, a retired attorney, said that over time, he thinks the movement’s message of anti-authoritarianism will prevail.
Amaya said in-person demonstrations, like “No Kings” protests, are often when people realize the power of community. Voices are stronger when they’re united, he added.
“The people have the power,” he said. “Not just one man who has a big ego.”
The Annapolis “No Kings” protest, according to Chesapeake Indivisible facilitator Eric Burg, had more than 250 people signed up as of Thursday, but attendance is usually two to five times greater than how many people are registered.
The protest, which Burg said will be held at the Annapolis Mall so attendees can be safe and spread out, is not going to be civil disobedience in “any way, shape or form. This is just us expressing our First Amendment rights.”
“The most important thing we can do is not relinquish our humanity, not relinquish our compassion, not comply in advance,” he said.
Burg said many people may be unable or unwilling to go out and protest, but the goal is to make it part of the national conversation.
“Protest has been a part of America before it was a country,” he said. “We’re keeping it peaceful, and we want to make sure that it’s accessible, and, most importantly, force people to have that conversation.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2210417859-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 19:05:35.703960

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Four new film productions are headed for Utah and will receive a tax credit under the state’s film incentive program, including a “Yellowstone” spinoff and a new season of “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch.” 
That’s according to the Utah Film Commission, which made the announcement on Friday. The four productions will generate an estimated economic impact of about $57.4 million and more than 380 jobs, with filming set to take place in Salt Lake, Summit, Wasatch and Uintah counties. 
The “Yellowstone” spinoff — titled “Y: Marshals” — is the latest addition to the popular series that drew millions of viewers and was partly filmed in Utah. But after filming three seasons in the Beehive State, the production packed up and relocated to Montana, where it was offered a better tax break. That loss contributed to lawmakers expanding the state’s film incentive for rural productions. 
“Y: Marshals” will star Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton, continuing the arc of his “Yellowstone” character as a member of the U.S. Marshalls. Production will begin in Summit County this fall, and the show has a $52 million budget. 
“Utah is such a draw for film and television because of its diverse landscapes, fantastic crews, and amazing, knowledgeable film office,” said Adam Morra, vice president of planning and finance for Paramount Global, in a statement. “There is no doubt, though, the film incentive is a vital and necessary part of the package.”

The seventh season of “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch” will also receive a tax credit under the state’s rural film incentive program. Focused on the notorious Skinwalker Ranch in Uintah County, the History Channel show follows researchers who explore the ranch’s reported paranormal activity. It has a $3.2 million budget. 
Filmed in Wasatch and Summit counties with a $1.8 million budget, “Keep Coming Back” is the third production to receive incentives under the state’s rural film program. It’s an independent film from director and producer Mark Rosman, who said the tax incentives, experienced film crews and proximity to Los Angeles made Utah a draw. 
“When it came to picking a state to shoot the film, it was natural to look at Utah,” Rosman said in a statement. 
And the new competition show “Freshman Inventors” will receive a rebate under the Utah Community Film Incentive Program. With plans to film in Salt Lake County with a $300,000 budget, the Netflix show highlights Gen Z inventors. 
The Utah Motion Picture Incentive Program currently offers a refundable tax credit up to 25% for funds spent in the state, with different sums of money set aside for productions that meet certain criteria. The rural film incentive — which “Y: Marshals,” “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch” and “Keep Coming Back” qualified for — sets aside $12 million per year for projects that spend at least 75% of production days in a rural county. 
The community film incentive program is a 20% post-performance cash rebate for projects that originate in Utah. It’s aimed at helping smaller productions with budgets between $100,000 to $500,000, and is meant to promote up-and-coming local filmmakers, according to Utah Film Studios.

Santiago/Getty Images)Washington is one of a few states whose Medicaid data has reportedly been shared with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which could use it to potentially track down immigrants without legal status.
The shared information, including names, addresses, and social security numbers, is from California, Illinois and Washington D.C., on top of Washington state, according to the Associated Press. This comes as the Trump administration seeks to ramp up deportations.
Washington provides benefits that mirror Medicaid to immigrants in the U.S. without legal authorization. Enrollment is capped based on available funding, and only state dollars are used to pay for the program. The other states with data handed over offer similar benefits.
The agency that runs Washington’s Medicaid program, known as Apple Health, wasn’t sure “what information was disclosed or how it may have been used.”
“We’ve seen the reports and are deeply concerned about the potential misuse of personal health information belonging to Washington Apple Health clients,” state Health Care Authority spokesperson Katie Pope said in an email on Friday. 
“We are currently working closely with the Governor’s Office and the Attorney General’s Office to understand the scope of what occurred, including what data from Washington has been shared and how many individuals may have been affected,” Pope continued.
As of this spring, nearly 2 million Washington residents were enrolled in Apple Health, including over 850,000 children.
Medicaid, primarily funded by the federal government and run by the states, provides health insurance to low-income residents. 
Federal law prohibits noncitizens from accessing Medicaid, but states can shell out money for programs that cover immigrants. Washington state lawmakers this year earmarked $150 million for this purpose, enough to continue coverage for about 13,000 people. 
California and Illinois have moved to freeze or shut down their similar programs. Republicans in Congress have proposed reductions in federal Medicaid reimbursements for states that provide this kind of coverage to immigrants.
In a statement, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said, “President Trump consistently promised to protect Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries.”
“To keep that promise after Joe Biden flooded our country with tens of millions of illegal aliens CMS and DHS are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans,” McLaughlin continued.
In light of a February executive order from President Donald Trump, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services late last month announced it was reviewing state Medicaid data to ensure federal funds weren’t being used on immigrants without legal status. 
“Medicaid is not, and cannot be, a backdoor pathway to subsidize open borders,” Mehmet Oz, the agency’s administrator, said in a statement at the time. “States have a duty to uphold the law and protect taxpayer funds.”
California, Washington and Illinois shared information about noncitizens receiving health coverage, according to the AP, citing a June 6 memo.
“Protecting the privacy of our Apple Health clients is core to our mission, and we take these concerns very seriously,” said Pope, of the Health Care Authority. “We’ll continue to coordinate with state and federal partners to determine the facts and will take appropriate action as we learn more.”
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are within the Department of Health and Human Services, run by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose advisers ordered the Medicaid data shared with the Department of Homeland Security, the AP reported Friday. They reportedly shared the information despite pushback from federal Medicaid officials.
The sharing came as federal immigration agents conducted immigration raids in California that led to protests.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Amid looming federal cuts, legislators finalized the state spending plan for the next fiscal year Friday, announcing they expect to take a final vote on the budget Monday evening.
As of Friday evening, the budget had not been printed, but Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ed Hooper, R-Clearwater, told reporters the spending plan is about $500 million less than what Gov. Ron DeSantis’ proposed $115.6 billion budget for state fiscal year 2025-26.
Friday marked the 102nd day of this year’s legislative session, which was extended because of the legislative leaders’ failure to pass a budget. Disagreements over the size of the budget and what approach to take on tax cuts created a rift that pushed lawmakers to come back to Tallahassee to pass a budget before June 30 to avoid a government shutdown.
House Budget Committee Chair Lawrence McClure, R-Dover, said the debate took longer than it should have, but put the blame in part on special sessions on immigration called prior to the start of the 2025 legislative session.
“That took a lot of bandwidth from both chambers, membership and staff. So I’m not excusing that we’re delayed in getting this budget done, but there were contributing factors that largely were out of the control of either chamber,” he said. “I’m glad we did the work on immigration. It was important work. But I’m thankful we were as thorough as we were,” on the budget.
Preparing for Congress fallout
McClure also stressed the leaner budget. He emphasized the $1.5 billion set for reserves over the next two fiscal years, which the GOP-led Legislature is touting as an answer for a potential recession. 
“For starters, it’s a smaller supplemental list than many years prior,” McClure said, adding, “we’ve put a bunch of recurring money in reserve stabilizing the long-term future.”
Lawmakers last dipped into the Budget Stabilization Fund, which currently has $4.4 billion, during the Great Recession.
Still, President Donald Trump’s plan to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Agency after this year’s hurricane season worried Hooper, he said. The Senate agreed to provide $23 million for the Florida State Guard — DeSantis had requested $62 million — keeping in mind the civilian volunteer force’s role in responding to emergencies. 
“We heard yesterday that, from our friends in Washington, after this hurricane season, there may be no more FEMA,” Hooper said. “We may be on our own someday, and that would not be the time to start thinking about what should we plan ahead. … Just the state guard is an important part of making sure our state has the resources because the National Guard; it could be called anywhere.”
The Florida State Guard has mainly been part of DeSantis’ messaging against illegal immigration, particularly in sending troops to Texas’ southern border.
Hooper also expressed concerns about the multi-billion-dollar cut to Medicaid that Congress could enact. About 44% of federal funds coming into the state are for Medicaid. 
“We hope they never change the formula of the Medicaid reimbursement,” he said. “We’re in trouble if they do.”

Legislators earmarked nearly $560 million for local projects important to members. The supplemental funding was included on so-called sprinkle lists the chambers released Friday.  But those hundreds of millions went to more than local projects.
The powerful nursing home industry was able to secure significant Medicaid rate increases for long-term care facilities on both the House and Senate sprinkle lists. In the aggregate, the chambers agreed to a $176 million hike, of which about $18 million is recurring.  That’s on top of a near $110 million rate increase the chambers had already agreed to put in the budget.
The increase in funds is expected to be coupled with new requirements on nursing homes that will be addressed in separate legislation, known as the conforming bill. It will be one of a spate of issues contained in SB 2514 the health care conforming bill.
The House targeted $23.3 million in state and federal funds to a Medicaid managed care program for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The program is a priority of House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, who pushed this year to take the small pilot program available in two Medicaid regions statewide.
Farmers Feeding Florida
Republican Senate President Ben Albritton, of Wachula, had to give up his dreams for a $200 million “Rural Renaissance” to invest in the state’s underdeveloped and economically challenged communities. But he managed to keep most of the money for tackling food insecurity. 
Before budget negotiations fell apart earlier in the year, the Senate’s budget included two grant programs through the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services: $12 million to expand the infrastructure of food banks in rural communities, and another $38 million to help food banks buy products from Florida farmers. 
In this final deal, Albritton gets to keep $10 million for food bank infrastructure and $28 million for farmers to feed communities. Food bank networks across the state counted on this investment following the loss of millions in federal funds they used to buy fresh produce.
Education
The Senate included in its sprinkle list $300,000 for an “Intellectual Freedom Survey,” half for the State University System and half for the Florida College System. The survey is meant to “compile and analyze the annual intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity survey.”
The House included $7.5 million for Florida Polytechnic University to increase its enrollment to 3,000 students. Its fall 2024 enrollment was more than 1,770. 
The chambers agreed to fund $42.4 million to Florida State University for operational funding, the most of any institution. Florida International University would receive $35 million under the proposed budget for operation enhancement. 
Between the two chambers’ sprinkle lists, $10 million has been allocated to security for Jewish day schools.
In its Friday offer, the Senate rejected a House proposal to require private universities to meet performance metrics to accept scholarships for in-state students. 
The House included in its sprinkle list $4 million for Florida State University, half for the newly created Institute for Pediatric Rare Diseases and half for Sunshine Genetics Pilot Program. 
Delivering for DeSantis
In the sprinkle list, the Senate was more amenable to DeSantis’ requests. 
Aside from including funds for the State Guard, the upper chamber also included $25 million for the Florida Job Growth Grant Fund, an initiative to encourage public infrastructure projects. In total, the budget includes $50 million out of the $75 million in DeSantis’ proposed budget. 
Cancer funding has been a priority for the DeSantis administration which pushed this year for a number of changes to how the state funds cancer research. 
While the DeSantis administration fell short on its efforts to redirect $127 million in cancer funds it did succeed on other fronts. The Legislature agreed to appropriate $50 million for a research incubator for cancer and another $60 million increase in innovation funds awarded by the First Lady Casey DeSantis as part of her cancer initiative.
More work to do
The budget is complete but the tax reduction plan is not.
Legislators are also expected to hammer out a tax cut package that will include a reduction in business rent taxes as well as other changes designed to assist Florida families.
While the chambers have agreed to spending levels and the fine print that goes along with how the money should be spent they still haven’t finalized the conforming bills. The Legislature is using budget conforming bills to pass substantive policy. Unlike the budget, which expires in a year, conforming bills change statutes.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Democratic members of the Colorado congressional delegation criticized a recent proposal by U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, to allow the federal government to sell off more than 2 million acres of public land. The proposal covers 11 Western states, including Colorado.
Introduced Wednesday, the proposal would target “underused” public lands to sell for housing development, roads, water infrastructure and other projects, according to Lee. During a remote news conference Friday, the proposal drew disapproval from U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, as well as Reps. Joe Neguse of Lafayette, Jason Crow of Centennial and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood. 
“(This proposal) is a five alarm fire for hunters, for fishermen, for conservationists, for recreationists and for everyday Colorado folks who enjoy these lands and who are committed to preserving them for future generations,” Neguse said. “The fact that they are potentially trying to auction off these lands to pay for President (Donald) Trump’s reckless tax agenda, tax cuts for billionaires and large corporations, in my view, is shameful.”
Neguse represents Colorado’s 2nd Congressional District, 60% of which is made up of public lands.

Lee’s proposal would insert the public lands sell-off measure into the GOP “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill, which was passed by the House and is now before the Senate. Under the proposal, state and local governments would have priority to purchase the federal lands, and areas that already have a designation — like national parks, national monuments and mining claim sites — would be safe from sale. 
Public lands advocates fear for Colorado’s national parks under Trump budget proposals

Colorado is home to 23 million acres of federal public lands, which play a significant role in many local economies. Sarah Shrader, the president of the Grand Valley Outdoor Recreation Coalition in Grand Junction, called on Congress to save Colorado’s public lands from sale.
“These lands must remain protected, accessible and managed for the benefit of everyone, not just a few,” Shrader said. “It’s an economic imperative, an environmental responsibility and a moral commitment to future generations.”
Tony Prendergast, a hunting guide and rancher based in Crawford, pointed to the widespread support of his community for the protection of public lands, regardless of their political affiliation.
“There’s nothing like this issue that will fire up people like me to get involved politically,” Prendergast said. “The depth of the anger I feel, and the disappointment in those elected officials who are putting this proposal forward and those who will support this, is intense for me.”
After bipartisan opposition to a recent public land sale proposal in the House, the plan was axed. Bennet said he hopes there will be enough common ground to defeat the Senate proposal through continued negotiations. 
“Public lands make Colorado, Colorado,” Bennet said. “They make the West, the West. They’re the foundation of our economy, and they represent treasured parts of our culture, our geography and our history.”

What’s next?,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/wildlife-outdoors/sunday-hunting-proposal-passes-pa-house-whats-next/,Sen. Greg Rothman is expecting a debate and discussion on the topic in the Game and Fisheries Committee in the near future.,"A hunter walks across a field. (Getty Images)For the second year in a row, a proposal to repeal Pennsylvania’s Sunday hunting prohibition passed the state House in bipartisan fashion this week. After Wednesday’s vote, a bevy of organizations have weighed in with some arguing it’s past time to end the ban, while others say it would be a step backwards for the outdoor experience in Pennsylvania.
As the debate moves to the Senate, a key committee chair told the Capital-Star he’s still evaluating House Bill 1431, but the legislation advancing seems like good news. Senate Game and Fisheries Committee Chairperson Greg Rothman (R-Cumberland) said he expects to have a debate and vote on it in the near future.
“I think it’s an idea that’s time has come,” Rothman told the Capital-Star on Thursday. “Other states allow it. What we want to be doing as a state government is to promote hunting and make it as accessible as possible, especially to working families and to younger people.”
“And I think Sunday (hunting) gives them more opportunities,” he added. “So the more opportunities to hunt gets more hunters, and helps us keep this great tradition alive in Pennsylvania.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The sale of hunting licenses generated more than $59 million in revenue for the Game Commission last year.
Rothman said he supports Sen. Dan Laughlin’s (R-Erie) proposal to end the ban and believes that proposal would have the support in the chamber. Rothman said state Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny) assured him the language in her proposal is the same in Laughlin’s. While the bill proposed by Laughlin also has the support of Sen. James Malone (D-Lancaster), the minority chair of the Senate Game and Fisheries Committee, Rothman wants to go over the details of Steele’s proposal to see if it can also pass the chamber. 
An ‘archaic’ law
Steele described the state’s ban as “archaic” and “not based in the reality of today.”
Pennsylvania expanded Sunday hunting in 2019 when Gov. Tom Wolf signed a law to allow hunting on three Sundays each year: One during archery season, one during rifle season, and one Sunday selected by the Game Commission. Laughlin also led that effort.
Prior to the 2019 expansion, hunting had been mostly illegal on Sundays for over 200 years under the state’s Blue Laws, which stem from the Quaker foundations of the commonwealth and barred certain activities on the sabbath.
“It’s a law that most states have eliminated long ago,” Steele said during debate on the House floor, noting that with a Monday to Friday workweek, most people only have Saturday to hunt. “Not being able to hunt on Sundays creates major hurdles for busy families. It’s a significant barrier for working people.”
Steele described herself as “not a typical hunter” and someone who did not grow up learning to hunt. But she spent a lot of time outdoors and later picked it up as an adult and mother of four children. She said she’s been welcomed into the hunting community wholeheartedly.
“It has been a gratifying experience,” Steele said.
Her proposal is backed by the Pennsylvania Game Commission, Pennsylvania Federation of Sportsmen and Conservationists, Hunter Nation, Hunters United for Sunday Hunting, and Backcountry Hunters & Anglers.
The Game Commission celebrated the bill advancing Wednesday, issuing a statement referencing a number of reasons that it backs the measure.
“Though hunters play an active role in helping to manage wildlife populations through the purchase of their licenses and other revenue they generate, they also fund wildlife conservation at a larger scale, for all species,” Game Commission Executive Director Steve Smith said. “For those reasons and others, it’s important to keep hunters engaged and providing the valuable service they do. These bills would help accomplish that.”
“One of the biggest reasons hunters stop hunting is a lack of time,” he added. “While no one can add hours to the day or days to the week, removing the prohibition on Sunday hunting holds the potential to add significantly more time to the hunting calendar and keep hunters hunting.”

The Pennsylvania Farm Bureau said expanding hunting could help reduce crop damage across the state by better managing deer populations. The bill would require at least one member of the Game Commission’s Board of Commissioners to have an agriculture background.
The bill passed by a 131-72 vote on Wednesday, with support from most Democrats. Republicans were more divided on the matter.
The House unanimously approved an amendment to H.B. 1431, to restore the hunting rights of people charged with trespassing immediately upon their acquittal or dismissal of the charges. Other amendments were rejected, including one defeated along party lines that would move the first day of deer hunting season to the Monday after Thanksgiving.
The debate around Sunday hunting in Pennsylvania is far from new.
Last session, the House passed Steele’s bill to repeal the Sunday hunting ban by a 129-73 vote. That bill did not advance in the Senate.
Concerns remain among some lawmakers and organizations
Rep. David Maloney, minority chairperson of the House Game and Fisheries Committee, opposed H.B. 1431 and argued that it is “not a simple Sunday hunting piece of legislation.”
Touting his experience with hunting from a young age, Maloney said the bill would have “unintended consequences.” The problems Maloney had with the proposal included the language regarding trespassing penalties, the requirement for a member of the agriculture community to be on the Game Commission Board, the power given to farmers to hunt deer, and negative impacts on waterfowl hunters.
He also said he doesn’t buy the supporters’ argument about free time. Maloney said since he began hunting at age 12, the opportunities to hunt throughout the year have more than doubled.
Maloney also said he believes the bill is unconstitutional because it violates the requirement that legislation must be limited to a single subject. For that reason, Maloney said he doesn’t believe the Senate would consider it or Gov. Josh Shapiro would sign it.
Rep. Greg Vitali (D-Delaware), one of the three Democrats who did not vote in support of H.B. 1431, said the Pennsylvania chapter of the Sierra Club, the Keystone Trails Association, and the Pennsylvania Parks and Forest Foundation oppose the bill.
Jen Quinn, legislative and political director for the Pennsylvania Chapter of the Sierra Club, told the Capital-Star the organization supports hunting and effective management of the deer population, but cited a number of concerns she has with the proposal.
“Our concern is that when people know there are hunters in the woods, are they going to stay out?” Quinn said.
She noted that it is relatively safe to be in the woods with hunters, but there are people who may decide to stay home instead of enjoying the outdoors when hunters are out.
Quinn also said she doesn’t think the legislation would address the problem of deer overpopulation and the decline in hunting licenses.
“I doubt adding one more day will fix this, because the state did add three Sundays a few years ago, and it didn’t reverse that trend,” Quinn said. She also said that the organization supports phasing out lead ammunition, arguing that it is harmful to wildlife.
Brook Lenker, executive director of the Keystone Trails Association, said the organization was disappointed that H.B. 1431 passed the House, even though it anticipated it might move on to the Senate. He’s holding out hope that the Senate won’t pass the bill.
“We just feel that additional Sundays open to hunting has the potential to erode quality hiking opportunities on Pennsylvania’s trails … a lot of hiking occurs on weekends,” Lenker told the Capital-Star.
What’s next? 
Steele or Laughlin’s proposal would have to receive a vote in the Senate Game and Fisheries Committee before it could advance to a full vote in the chamber.
The Senate is slated to return to session on Monday, June 23. 
Earlier this year, both Steele and Laughlin, who are leading the efforts in their respective chambers again this session, told the Capital-Star that they were optimistic the bill could get across the finish line.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hunter-field-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 18:01:22.721956

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)A budget plan is taking shape and the clock is ticking.
Maine Morning Star will have regular updates as the committee tasked with setting that plan, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, takes straw votes on what to include ahead of a final vote on the budget proposal to be sent to the Maine Senate and House of Representatives for consideration.
Legislative leaders have said the intention is to complete all work by June 18, what had been the statutory adjournment date for the first regular session. Though, the Legislature is now in a special session, without a formal deadline.
In March, the Democratic majority pushed through a roughly $11.3 billion, two-year budget plan without Republican support and formally adjourned in order to start the clock for those funds to become available in 90 days. 
Senate Republicans refused to back an alternative short-term plan that would have immediately filled the current deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, because it did not include structural reform to the program.
The budget that did pass continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing one-time funding for MaineCare and other urgent needs. But it didn’t include any of the policy changes Gov. Janet Mills proposed, such as tax increases and program cuts, to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
These proposals and others from lawmakers are now being weighed by the appropriations committee as it crafts the next iteration of the budget.

Committee yet to convene


By: Emma Davis - Friday June 13, 2025 5:30 pm


















As of 5:30 p.m. on Friday, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee has yet to meet on microphone to set the budget plan, after scheduling a work session for 9 a.m.

Adding streaming tax, upping cannabis tax and continuing free community college


By: Emma Davis - Thursday June 12, 2025 10:23 pm


















Returning on microphone after 9 p.m. Thursday night, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee voted to include several additional taxes proposed by Gov. Janet Mills in the budget, including a tax on streaming services and increasing the sales tax on cannabis. However, the committee included a smaller amount than the governor suggested to continue funding free community college. 
The committee voted 7-4 to include Mills’ proposed new 5.5% tax on streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. 
The committee also voted 8-4 to increase the sales tax on adult use cannabis from 10% to 14%, while reducing the cannabis excise tax rates by one-third. This was not a party-line vote. Rep. Kristen Cloutier (D-Lewiston), who co-chairs the Taxation Committee, said she was not in favor of this initiative.
“I’ve been in contact with some folks who are in the cannabis industry in my district and they have really advocated loudly against this,” Cloutier said. 
With these decisions made, the committee has now decided on what to include, and not include, out of Mills’ major tax proposals. 
In addition to the streaming and cannabis taxes, earlier Thursday the committee rolled back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes and increased the cigarette excise tax at an even higher amount than Mills requested. However, the committee rejected her suggested taxes on ambulances and pharmacies.
Most debate surrounded including funding to continue Maine’s Free College Scholarship, which the committee decided to fund but at a reduced amount. 
Rather than include the $12.5 million per year sought by the governor, the committee voted 9-3 to fund the program at $10 million per year through the next biennium. 
“We’ve had to make hard decisions about what we think we can afford, not afford, and we’re supportive but we believe that they’ll be able to address a need with $10 million a year,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.
However, to help guide decisions about continuing the program beyond that, the committee will be writing a letter to the community colleges requesting recommendations on eligibility requirements, out-of-state student funding, economy of scale and estimated future funding. 
“We had promised nights that would not be long,” committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said at 10:10 p.m. “We have just a little bit to finish up, but we will do that in the morning.” The committee is scheduled to reconvene at 9 a.m.

Budget gets bump from a “large and unusual” payment


By: Emma Davis -  5:33 pm


















The Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee announced Thursday afternoon the state has come into more cash that can be added to the budget. The additional funds are from some state agencies seeing unexpected surpluses this fiscal year. It also comes from two significant estate payments.
The majority of the committee moved all of this funding into the budget plan with 8-4 votes. 
Since the most recent revenue forecast in May, Maine received two “large and unusual” estate payments, Kirsten Figueroa, commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, told the appropriations committee Thursday afternoon. This now puts the estate tax line well above what was initially expected.
“Does that mean two people passed and this is where this money came from?” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) asked.
“I do,” Figueroa responded.  
The way this funding, $24 million, will be added to the budget is also unusual, because technically the money isn’t real until the fiscal year ends on June 30. But ultimately it will be used to pay for part of the $122 million in MaineCare funding for fiscal year 2027 that the committee voted into the budget on Wednesday. 
The majority of the committee also voted into the budget millions of dollars that various departments are not planning to use up by the end of the fiscal year. Among those funds are $4.5 million from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Behavioral Health and $5 million from the Office of Disability Services.
“I would rather keep the money in the account and have it be used for what it should be used for, rather than going to the general fund, which by going into the general fund, is essentially funding MaineCare,” Fredette said.

Committee saves money by rolling back funding for mental health programs, pensions


By: Emma Davis -  12:27 pm


















While not sticking to its stated start time, the appropriations committee returned Thursday morning to take more straw votes to work toward a complete budget plan. The committee plans to return throughout the day for more votes.
Mental health
Following the deadliest mass shooting in Maine history in 2023, the state put significant resources into bolstering mental health support. However, faced with the current deficit, the appropriations committee opted to reduce some of those programs.
On Tuesday, the committee approved funding for crisis receiving centers in Penobscot and Androscoggin counties but on Thursday voted out money for these centers in Kennebec and Aroostook counties.
In the supplemental budget last year, the governor signed into law funding to develop these crisis receiving centers following the Lewiston shooting. When presenting her two-year budget plan back in January, Mills argued it was not financially feasible to build all of the centers she had hoped. 
Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison raised concern about walking back on these commitments and said the centers were a point of rare bipartisan agreement last year, though the overall budget was passed mostly along party lines with Democrats in favor. 
“As someone who actually voted for the funding for this in the previous budget, this is a difficult cut for me to accept,” said committee co-chair Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook). 
Regarding Aroostook County in particular, Gattine said he spoke with the Department of Health and Human Services, whose representatives think that this specific model might not be the best for that rural area, so they may suggest an alternative crisis model in the future. 
The committee also removed funding for 24 mental health law enforcement liaisons to support mental health crisis intervention, and mobile response services.
The majority of the appropriations committee also voted to make cuts to various mental health services.
The committee voted 7-5 to provide county jails $4 million for medication assisted treatment to address drug dependency in fiscal year 2026, but did not include funding for the following year, which Gattine explained could be revisited in a supplemental budget next year. The committee also reduced funding for employee recruitment and retention of staff that provide medication management services within the Office of Behavioral Health.
Mills proposed a number of reductions to the overall state budget, focusing on new programs  that had not yet been fully started. While Gattine again reiterated the cuts are not something he takes lightly, he said, “I really came back to the fact that the baseline of MaineCare, everything that we have funded, provides millions and billions of dollars of support for behavioral health needs. I don’t think we support those needs enough. I’m hoping we can continue to do things to support the needs of people with behavioral health needs.”
Pensions 
Another area where the majority of the committee proposed to save money is rolling back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes.
The committee voted 8-5 to incorporate Mills’ proposal to phase-out a current deduction offered for nonmilitary pensions, though changed the thresholds. 
Mills proposed a phase-out beginning with income over $100,000 for individuals, $150,000 for heads of households and $200,000 for married individuals filing jointly. But the committee backed phase outs starting at $125,000 for individuals, $187,500 for heads of household, and $250,000 for joint filers. 
“The money that we’re taking belongs to them,” Rep. Mark Blier (R-Buxton) said in protest. “It doesn’t belong to us.”
Paid Family and Medical Leave 
The committee voted 7-5 to include funding the governor proposed to help cover the costs of the community college system, Maine Maritime Academy and the University of Maine System for the state-supported positions related to the new Paid Family and Medical Leave Program, which took effect on Jan. 1. 
However, the committee reduced the allocations Mills suggested for the university system, which Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, said it was because the system negotiated with a company that is allowing them to get premiums to cover some of the cost. 
Amid the voting, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) wanted to specify that this is one-time funding to cover the initial cost of the paid family leave program, after Republicans raised concerns about the state being on the hook. The committee ultimately incorporated that note.
“So you are going to take the lollipop away from the baby,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “I’m anxious to see that. Thank you.”
Additional decisions
The majority of the committee also approved an increase from $5 to $7 for fishing license fees. 
Also, following the request of the Legislative Council, which is made up of the ten elected members of leadership, the committee agreed to incorporate several temporary legislative positions, though did not go so far as to make them permanent.

Increased cigarette tax, rejected child care cuts, funded MaineCare


By: Emma Davis - Wednesday June 11, 2025 10:50 pm


















The budget took more of a shape Wednesday night, though, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said, “we are determined to get this budget done in the daylight,” so the committee is reconvening at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. 
Substantial decisions were made Wednesday night when the committee reconvened, including increasing Maine’s cigarette tax more than Gov. Janet Mills’ had proposed, rejecting Mills’ proposed cuts to child care worker stipends and Head Start, and adding funding for MaineCare. 
When Mills first proposed her budget in January, a key component she highlighted to address the deficit was her plan to raise revenue through a $1 increase in the cigarette excise tax — from $2 per pack to $3 — and corresponding increases to the excise tax on other tobacco-related products.
The majority of the appropriations committee voted 8-4 to increase it by $1.50.
Since Mills released her proposal, Republicans have been steadfast about their opposition to raising this tax, and to tax increases of any kind. On Wednesday those in the minority party on the committee again made that stance clear.
“I was shocked when the governor came out with the original proposed tax increase on the cigarettes of a buck,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said, “and now to throw it up to a buck and a half. I see in my opinion, with all due respect to everyone around this horseshoe, a lack of ability to make tough decisions on where we’re going to spend money in this state.”
When Mills presented her proposal back in January, she touted it as a way to help generate revenue while simultaneously reducing public health costs in the long-term by disincentivizing people to smoke. Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln) highlighted that goal in voicing her support for upping the tax, stating that her stepfather recently died of cancer caused by cigarettes.
But Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester) countered, “I don’t feel like it’s responsible to base our budget on revenue that we hope will go down.”
The majority of the committee, voting 7-5, subsequently approved about $122 million for MaineCare, filling a gap left in the initial two-year budget passed in March that did not include MaineCare funding for the second year of the biennium. 
“I do believe we should pay our bills, but we also had reforms to hopefully reduce that amount that we’re paying,” Arata said, referring to proposals to implement work requirements and other reforms to the program that failed to be included in the supplemental budget for the current fiscal year. “Therefore, I can’t support this motion.”  
The majority almost entirely rejected the governor’s proposed cuts related to child care programs, with one exception. 
Voting 7-5 again, the committee removed from the budget plan Mills’ proposal to reverse the state’s recent investments in child care by reducing worker stipends by $30 million to bring them back to 2022 levels. With the same vote breakdown, the committee also rejected Mills’ proposal to cut funding for Head Start by $7 million. 
That same majority also rejected a proposed $2.5 million cut in fiscal year 2026 to the child care employment award program, which includes child care staff in the Maine Child Care affordability program, however the committee chose to remove funding for the award program in 2027. 
“This was styled as a two-year pilot program, so our intent is to continue the pilot program in 2026, not provide funding for it in fiscal year 2027 at this time,” said Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “We’ll have a chance to evaluate that next year when we reconvene.”  
Although a budget-neutral move, one decision Wednesday night received praise from Republicans. 
Mills proposed elevating the current Governor’s Energy Office to a cabinet-level department in her budget plan but the committee removed that change Wednesday, in light of a separate bill moving through the Legislature that seeks to do that. 
“I appreciate the fact that we are letting this kind of an initiative be debated as it should be in the policy committees and brought to the floor for a vote,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison.

Preserving Maine State Grant Program


By: Emma Davis -  3:58 pm


















Wednesday morning the appropriations committee made a number of reductions to the governor’s proposed funding for various departments. Returning briefly just after 3 p.m., the majority of its members chose to again reject a proposal from Mills, following requests from private higher education institutions. 
Currently, all Maine public and private universities, colleges and technical schools that administer federal financial aid, such as the Pell Grant and Direct Loans, are eligible for something called the Maine State Grant Program, which provides need-based assistance.
The governor proposed cutting Maine’s private colleges from the program, which educators and students pushed back on during the public hearing. The Education and Cultural Affairs Committee also requested the change be rejected. The appropriations committee followed suit Wednesday voting the change out of the plan 8-2. 
“Stay tuned,” appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said after the afternoon votes. “We will be back later. I’m not quite sure when but we will be back.”

Mobile home program funded while judiciary requests pared down


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 10, 2025 6:50 pm


















Indicative of the lack of sleep and long hours legislators are working, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) accidentally called a vote as unanimous as the committee met while the Senate was still in session Tuesday afternoon. 
The mishap was met with laughs as it was bookended by votes on a number of items — none of which were unanimous. 
The majority of the committee backed one-time funding — a transfer of $3 million from the unappropriated surplus of the general fund to the Maine State Housing Authority — for the manufactured and mobile home park preservation and assistance program. This was a request in a bill that passed the chambers but was placed on the appropriations table. 
There are currently more than 100 bills on this table, which is managed by the appropriations committee. Bills that cost money that hasn’t already been allocated are placed here to vie for remaining unappropriated funding — or, as evidenced by this case, could instead be included in the budget plan. 
After the committee sets the budget, one of its final acts will be to “run the table” and decide which of the remaining bills will receive funds.
Other items added into the plan include one-time funding to upgrade courtrooms with video conferencing technology. However, the committee also moved out numerous other proposals related to the judiciary, such as funding for new positions, resources and ​​increasing the number of jurors called to jury duty.
“I think we’re shortchanging the judiciary,” said Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport). 
Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee, said he believed many of the items the committee ultimately voted out were important. 
“I think by the time we’re done here, there will be over $20 million in new funding approved for them, and I hope the process is that they’re able to come back and we’re able to do more for them over time,” Gattine said.

A move to maximize federal match for free school meals


By: Emma Davis -  11:34 am


















Amid chamber work Tuesday morning, the majority of the Appropriations Committee voted in favor of a change aimed to maximize federal dollars for free school lunches in order to save the state an expected $2 million. 
After the COVID-19 pandemic, Maine became one of a handful of states to pass legislation making school meals free.
“[That] took away that stigma and took away that paperwork that was associated with individual families and individual students, so now everybody in the school district does qualify,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. “But we do have some school districts that have not enrolled in the program, so we’re not able to maximize the federal funding that’s available.”
After the committee voted to pay the difference between the federal reimbursement and full price of meals for schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program, Brennan introduced an amendment to require that in order for schools to get this state funding they must first enroll in the free meal program in a way that makes them eligible for the maximum money available at the federal level. The committee approved the change with a 9-2 straw vote. 
Much of the committee’s work has been approving, or rejecting, a number of state government positions. Republicans have continued to raise objections to expanding state government personnel. 
“I think one thing we can agree on is that it’s all a balance,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “And, maybe we balance things in different places, but finding the right balance is part of what this is all about.”

Another of Gov. Mills’ proposed taxes removed from plan


By: Emma Davis - Monday June 9, 2025 4:53 pm


















Monday morning at the State House began with more talk about taxes as the Appropriations Committee continued its line-by-lines votes on what to include in the budget. 
The majority of the committee voted to remove Mills’ proposed tax on ambulance services, which is one of several tax increases the governor proposed as a means to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
The tax on non-municipal ambulance service providers would have been equal to 6% of their net operating revenue, which the Mills administration said it would have used to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements.
While Republicans on the committee said they supported removing the tax — as the minority party has made clear it will not support tax increases of any kind — they questioned how the state will deal with those shortfalls and pay for additional spending the committee has approved. 
One example from Monday was reallocating the cost of an emergency coordinator position that is partially funded through federal expenditures to being completely supported by the general fund. 
“We’re moving positions and costs into the general fund, and my only question is, where is that money coming from?” Sen. Sue Bernard (R-Aroostook) asked. “Is it coming from more tax increases? Is it coming from cutting other programs that we haven’t gotten to yet, or what?”
Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin), who co-chairs the committee, responded, “As we build this budget, we will take care of that in one way or another so that the budget will balance at the end.” 
It is not yet clear whether the committee will support some of Mills’ other proposed taxes or the cuts she proposed to health and child care programs. So far, the committee also voted out a proposed pharmacy tax. 
Implications from federal funding cuts were also top of mind. 
The coordinator position was one of several that the committee readjusted to be more reliant on state funding, though Mills made those recommendations before President Donald Trump’s administration began rescinding congressionally appropriated funds. 
“We have talked about the fact that if federal funds disappear, positions disappear,” Rotundo said. 
But some concerns about federal funding predated Trump’s second term. During the public hearing for the budget bill, the Maine Emergency Management Agency said budget deficits related to federal funding had already resulted in the agency leaving two positions vacant. 
The committee voted to fund two positions fully with the general fund, after they’d previously been supported solely by federal dollars. 
“It was important to make sure that these positions were preserved and that it was worth the investment in additional general fund dollars,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), the other co-chair of the committee.

With less than two weeks left, lawmakers still debating budget plan


By: Emma Davis -  4:51 pm


















During the committee’s last meeting on Thursday, the majority of its members rejected a tax on Maine pharmacies the governor had proposed, while voting in favor of additional funding and rate reform for nursing homes. 
The pharmacy tax would have imposed a 70-cent tax on every outpatient prescription filled by Maine pharmacies, the revenue from which the Mills administration said it would use to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements. 
“I haven’t voted for any items,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison on Thursday. “Yet, this will be my first, because I believe that we already collect too much taxes.” 
With a 10-2 vote, other Republicans backed removing the tax too, though the holdouts noted that their opposition was because of a lack of clarity about the overall budget plan. 
“I applaud the work of the majority in terms of removing this,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “However, I will be consistent in reviewing the overall global budget in determining whether or not I will support it.” 
That sentiment was also shared ahead of the committee voting 9-3 in favor of $20 million in additional funding for nursing homes over the biennium. This includes a $6.5 million investment for rate reform to support the direct care workforce and incentivize permanent staff, which would in turn unlock $12.2 million in funding from the federal government. 
“Nursing home rate reform is very important to us, however at this particular time we have not had a discussion about where additional general funds come from that we’re going to need,” Ducharme said. “In order for me to support this, even though I would historically support something like this, I want to know where the money’s coming from.”
Other Republicans had a different take. While Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata of New Gloucester would also like to know where the funds are coming from, “I feel right about supporting this,” she said. “I might not support the entire package, but I feel better knowing that this is in there, ultimately.”

(Courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) OMAHA — Federal authorities on Friday announced the arrests Thursday of four protesters outside of an Omaha immigration raid conducted earlier this week, alleging that the four were “aggressive” and captured on video damaging federal property and threatening to assault law officers in relation to the raid at Glenn Valley Foods.
The statement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided no names. It said the protesters arrested are expected to face felony charges of “assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating or interfering with a federal officer while engaged in the performance of their official duties, as well as damaging government property.”
Video of a few people throwing rocks and others blocking law enforcement cars at the Tuesday raid site were widely circulated on social media.
“Many of these protesters claim to be fighting for justice, but instead they damaged property, threatened federal officers and agents and attempted to obstruct a lawful operation aimed at arresting individuals who exploited stolen identities to work illegally,” Todd Lyons, acting ICE Director, said in a statement.
Federal immigration raid hits Omaha plant

During the enforcement operation at Glenn Valley, immigration agents detained nearly 80 workers. It was the largest immigration enforcement operation in Nebraska since President Donald Trump took office with a pledge to carry out massive deportations.
Of the workers detained, ICE has said some had active local warrants, prior DUI convictions or had been previously deported. The agency said in a statement that many may now face additional federal charges: fraud and misuse of visas, permits and other documents; assaulting a federal officer; resisting arrest; illegal reentry; and/or misuse of Social Security numbers.
The investigation was conducted by ICE Homeland Security Investigations, with support from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the FBI, and a fraud unit from the Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles.
“Peaceful protest is a right protected under the Constitution, and our agents are proud to defend that right every day,” said Mark Zito, Special Agent in Charge of ICE HSI Kansas City, which covers Omaha. “But threats, violence and property damage by criminal actors claiming some kind of vigilante justice will not be tolerated.”

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Legislation that would prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use passed with bipartisan support in the Maine Legislature Friday, winning over many Republicans who generally were less supportive of  previous attempts to provide the Wabanaki Nations greater sovereignty. However, initial votes show that support may not be enough to override an expected veto from Gov. Janet Mills. 
With 11 Republicans joining the Democratic majority, the Maine House of Representatives voted 86-60 on Friday in favor of the bill, preceded by ample debate. The Senate followed suit with a 20-12 vote but no discussion. 
However, a two-thirds vote in both chambers would be needed to override a veto. 
LD 958, which has bipartisan co-sponsors and received a favorable committee vote, would prohibit the state from exercising something called eminent domain on current trust and reservation land.
“This is an issue that small government conservatives and civil justice liberals can agree on,” bill sponsor House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) told Maine Morning Star. 
However, others in his caucus spoke against the bill during floor debate, highlighting that their opposition to this issue is attached to their overall opposition to tribal sovereignty efforts. 
“I cannot support this measure because I believe the issue is an issue to some degree less about eminent domain than it is about tribal sovereignty,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. Fredette went on to compare the Wabanaki Nations to states and municipalities. 
Governor opposed to latest change to Settlement Act backed by Wabanaki Nations

“Our states are not absolute sovereign from our federal government,” Fredette said. “Our towns are not absolute sovereign from the state in and the reality is that the tribes are not absolutely sovereign from the state of Maine.”
Most other federally recognized tribes are already afforded protection against states being able to seize tribal land for public use. However, the Wabanaki Nations are not, due to repercussions from the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. 
This land settlement agreement has resulted in the tribes being treated more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations like other federally recognized tribes. Overhauling this act in its entirety is the Wabanaki Nations’ broader goal for greater recognition of their sovereignty.
What would this bill do?
The U.S. government can seize private property for public use, a principle known as eminent domain, however that authority is restricted by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which requires just compensation for land taken, as well as some federal laws. 
In 1834, the federal Indian Nonintercourse Act prohibited land transactions with tribes unless authorized by Congress, but the Settlement Act specified that that federal law was not applicable to the Wabanaki Nations.
“As an ardent supporter of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights I stand opposed to the government taking people’s property through eminent domain,” Faulkingham said. “It is even more egregious to threaten seizure of property from sovereign tribes who have suffered from historic injustices of land seizures in the past.”
LD 958 would amend the Settlement Act to prohibit the state from exercising eminent domain on trust and reservation land, which is protected under federal law, though fee land — or private property for which the owner owns the title — would still be subject to the state taking.
The bill would also amend the 2023 Mi’kmaq Nation Restoration Act to make this change for the fourth Tribe of the Wabanaki Nations, the Mi’kmaq Nation, which wasn’t included in the Settlement Act.
“I feel like this is a no brainer,” Executive Director of the Wabanaki Alliance Maulian Bryant told Maine Morning Star. “We should have tribal land protected from state seizure, just like other tribes around the country.” 
Throughout committee consideration of the bill, it was amended to incorporate a proposed change from the Maine State Chamber of Commerce that the prohibition would only apply to current reservation and trust lands, and not land that may be put into trust in the future.
Each of the Wabanaki Nations are eligible to acquire up to 150,000 acres of trust land in specific areas identified in the Settlement Act. Several tribes have already acquired most of that. 
While the Judiciary Committee accepted that amendment, Passamaquoddy Tribal Rep. Aaron Dana, who is on the committee, told Maine Morning Star that some tribal leaders believed that compromise shouldn’t have been made. 
“We don’t want to keep negotiating away everything,” Dana said. “We’ve been negotiating everything away since the 1980s.”

Opposition 
“What we don’t know is what we don’t know,” Fredette said on the floor. “Would we, as a state, for the best interest of the state, require a sliver of a piece of land? I don’t know the answer to that.”
Fredette repeated many of the same talking points that the governor’s counsel, Jerry Reid, told the Judiciary Committee during a work session in which he shared that Mills is opposed to the bill.
After not testifying during the bill’s public hearing, Reid said on April 9 that Mills is concerned the bill could prevent the state government from addressing unpredictable future infrastructure needs, an issue also raised in written testimony from the Maine Department of Transportation. 
When pressed by committee members, Reid said he didn’t have a specific example of an infrastructure project that would warrant seizing tribal land but that, “We need to write the law mindful of the potential for problems.” 
Republican Sen. David Haggan of Penobscot, who was one of four committee members to vote against the bill in committee, invited Reid and Tim Woodcock, attorney with Eaton Peabody, to provide a question and answer session about the bill, which was only attended by Republican legislators on May 8. 
A handout from that meeting listed similar key points, pointing to uncertain future needs and arguing that the state needs to be mindful of the interests of the 1.4 million non-tribal Maine citizens, as well. 
“Informational sessions like this are not unusual,” the governor’s press secretary Ben Goodman said when asked why the session was held. 
So far, sweeping changes to the Settlement Act have failed due to opposition from Mills, though an omnibus sovereignty bill has been carried over into next year. Instead, the governor, lawmakers and Wabanaki leaders have successfully made some targeted adjustments, including expanding tribal authority to prosecute crimes last year. 
Craig Francis, a tribal attorney and Passamaquoddy citizen, told Maine Morning Star that the Wabanaki Nations hadn’t expected the eminent domain issue to garner the pushback from the Mills administration that it has.
“We’re trying to approach change that way because of what the governor has laid that out as a path forward,” Francis said, referring to the piecemeal approach. “We didn’t really see eminent domain as that big of an issue as her office is making it out to be.”
The state has not exercised eminent domain over tribal lands since the Settlement Act, a point Fredette also made on the House floor. This also means that, currently, the state’s ability to exercise eminent domain over tribal lands is not actually clear.
“I suspect that even if the state were going to attempt to take a piece of tribal land by eminent domain, it would be sufficiently litigated frankly for years before that were to happen,” Fredette said on the floor, “and so I think this is a bill that’s in search of a problem.”
Meanwhile, Francis said the likelihood of litigation is a reason to clarify rights now in the bill. 
“It leaves open legal questions that ultimately will end up having to be resolved by a court,” Francis said. “We’re trying to resolve it amicably because there’s always room for conversation in the future if [the state] needed land.”

(MDT graphic)A large-scale transportation study is now underway in central Montana, and the state Department of Transportation is looking for public input.
The Central Montana Transportation Study is looking for ways to improve access around Great Falls and Lewistown. Parts of nine counties in total will be part of the study, including Cascade, Choteau, Fergus, Judith Basin, Lewis and Clark, Pondera, Teton, Toole, and Wheatland Counties.
Increased development, as well as expansion of Malstrom Air Force Base, are expected to add traffic to the area. In one example, the average rate of traffic growth has increased west and south of the airbase by an annual rate of 1.3% since 2004.
“Malmstrom Air Force Base is preparing for construction, including on base improvements, as well as off base upgrades related to missile facilities and associated utility corridors, additionally, workforce hubs and temporary lay down areas are anticipated in surrounding communities to support off base construction,” a video for the project said.
An access management plan, which is part of the study, noted a number of car crashes in the area near the airbase and cutting those down is one of the focuses of the work. Other focus areas of the project near Great Falls include the intersection of Old Havre Highway and U.S. Highway 87.

In Lewistown, the “Sentinel Project” which will decommission Minuteman nuclear missiles and replace them with upgraded weapons, is likely to spark activity and traffic in the town, a MDT presentation said.
“Understanding the immediate and long-term transportation impacts of these developments is crucial for the city’s sustainable growth,” the presentation said. “This analysis will focus on traffic, safety, and infrastructure needs, considering both current conditions and anticipated growth.”
Other focuses include a seven-mile section of Armington Junction area east of Belt to the Cascade-Judith Basin county line. The primary route connecting Great Falls and Lewistown has a couple issues, state transportation said.
“Safety concerns in this area have been raised due to the narrow road width, poor roadside conditions, and limited passing opportunities,” the presentation said. “These issues are compounded by the nearby railroad tracks, Otter Creek, and the challenging terrain.”
MDT will be having two open houses on the plan, with the first to be hosted in Lewistown at Fergus High School on Tuesday, June 17 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. The second will be in Great Falls at the Civic Center’s Gibson Room on Wednesday, June 18 from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.

UPDATE:3:20 p.m., Friday, June 13, 2025 
A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement told Source New Mexico on Friday that Carrero-Marquez has been deported to his home country of Venezuela.
According to spokesperson Leticia Zamarripa, Carrero-Marquez “has been deemed a threat to the community due to his suspected affiliation with the foreign terrorist organization Tren de Aragua.” 
His wife, Daniela Marina Diaz-Ortiz, denied in an interview that her husband is a criminal or gang member, and a search of federal and state court records shows only a traffic ticket. The New York Times also recently reported that Trump administration officials have a low bar for deeming someone a Tren de Aragua member, including tattoos and clothing. 
As for the arrest itself, Zamarripa said Carrero-Marquez “passively resisted arrest and complained of having a medical condition.” Zamarripa said,“Emergency services were called,” to take him to the hospital and, upon being released from the hospital, and released to ICE custody. 
On Tuesday, June 10, Carrero-Marquez, ICE “removed him to his home country,” Zamarripa said. 





	Last Saturday around 8 a.m., as she followed her husband to a mechanic in Albuquerque’s South Valley, Daniela Marina Diaz-Ortiz says she and her 5-year-old daughter watched, terrified, as federal immigration agents leapt out of four SUVs and pulled her husband to the ground.
“They stopped him and took him out of the car. They didn’t ask him for any identification. They didn’t tell him he was under arrest or anything like that,” she told Source in Spanish in an interview outside her home Monday afternoon. “They just pulled him out of the car, threw him on the ground, putting their feet on his back and head. At that moment, they also lifted him up by his neck and forced him into the truck.”
Jesus Jose Carrero-Marquez, 30, was hospitalized at the Presbyterian Hospital emergency room for hours, potentially due to injuries sustained in the arrest, his wife and others told Source NM. 
Agents who waited outside Carrero-Marquez’s room told hospital workers that the detainee was a violent gang member, according to New Mexico Rep. Eleanor Chavez (D-Albuquerque), who advocates on behalf of working conditions for healthcare workers across the state. Chavez said she learned of the arrest from a hospital worker and relayed to Source what the worker told her. 
Diaz-Ortiz adamantly denied her husband is violent or a criminal or in a gang. Source’s review of state and federal criminal records for Carrero-Marquez showed only a local traffic ticket in January. 
Instead, Diaz-Ortiz said he is a father and husband who makes a living as a Doordash delivery driver, while seeking asylum on behalf of himself and his family after being injured in a protest against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro several years ago. The lawyer representing his appeal did not respond to requests for comment.
Diaz-Ortiz showed Source photos the family is using in its asylum appeal that show what appear to be injuries to Carrero-Marquez’s leg and back, which left him with a punctured lung and a limp, she said.
Source could not determine why federal immigration authorities arrested Carrero-Marquez on May 31; why they purportedly took him to the hospital; where he is being detained; or whether he’s been deported.
ICE offers Albuquerque immigrant reprieve — for now

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to questions from Source about Carrero-Marquez’s arrest, their alleged use of force or his current location. A spokesperson said the agency would respond but had not as of publication time after multiple requests. Source will update the story as necessary*. 
Advocates, including Chavez and immigration lawyers, have tried since May 31 to find him, including enlisting the help of U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office. A Heinrich spokesperson said the office had made efforts to find him but that “ICE is not providing timely or helpful responses to our inquiries.”
A recent change to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention policies has made it difficult to determine whether someone is in jail and, if so, at which detention center, said Sophia Genovese, a lawyer for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center who joined efforts this week to find Carrero-Marquez.
Following his arrest, Carrero-Marquez called his wife from detention somewhere in El Paso, Diaz-Ortiz said, and described severe pain in his head and back from the arrest, she said. 
The last time she spoke to him,  on Sunday, her husband “told me that they were taking him away, that he didn’t know where they were going, that he hadn’t seen a judge to decide whether he would be ordered to leave the country or not.” 
When she hadn’t heard from him again on Tuesday, Diaz-Ortiz told Source she felt certain he was gone.
“I believe my husband has already been deported,” she said, because otherwise, “I believe he would have called me.”
On Wednesday morning, Diaz-Ortiz said she woke up after a long night of making deliveries to check ICE detention records for updates, which she’s done multiple times a day since his arrest.
She discovered, and Source confirmed, he was no longer listed in custody as of Wednesday morning. And he still had not called her, she told Source.
“I still don’t know anything about what happened to him,” she said. 
“It just says, ‘Texas’”
Carrero-Marquez’s arrest follows the pattern of recent ICE detentions, which leave little trail for lawyers or advocates to follow, said Genovese with the Immigration Law Center.
After being arrested and hospitalized, Carrero-Marquez called his wife from his hospital bed, she said. But hospital workers would neither confirm he was there nor allow her to see or speak with him in the emergency room, she said. 
While the hospital would not confirm that Carrero-Marquez was hospitalized, a spokesperson said it has “Do Not Announce” protocols as part of federal patient privacy regulations and that patients may be under that protocol “for many reasons.” 
The hospital staff had no choice but to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, the hospital worker told Chavez, the state representative. A spokesperson for Presbyterian told Source that, while it cannot discuss specific patients, it is legally required to cooperate with all law enforcement agencies.
“We do not have policies designed to help or hinder any law enforcement or other governmental agencies,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday. 
Confusion reigns in New Mexico’s militarized border zone

The officers took Carrero-Marquez to jail, likely to the Torrance County Detention Center in Estancia, Genovese said, though jail records never showed him being held there.
Diaz-Ortiz was the first person to hear from him, a few days after the arrest, when he called from El Paso, she said. 
Before Wednesday, when his name disappeared completely, ICE records didn’t say where he’s being held, and instead only said “Texas,” instead of a facility name and address. According to Genovese, he could have been held at either the El Paso Service Processing Center or at a nearby former Border Patrol holding facility intended for short-term use that ICE recently took over. 
The ICE takeover of the holding facility has resulted in confusion and difficulty for lawyers seeking to speak to their clients. It also means no one knows where detainees are being held. 
“This is like a new trend, where we’re seeing a lot of people have the exact same situation where… it just says, ‘Texas.’ It doesn’t provide a detention facility,” Genovese said.
‘Thousands’ of arrests per day
As for why he might be in jail in the first place, Genovese said ICE agents increasingly have less discretion about detaining people who, like Carrero-Marquez, are appealing denials of asylum claims. 
According to online records and a document provided by Diaz-Ortiz, a judge denied Carrero-Marquez’s asylum request in February. Records also show he is appealing that denial, and that the appeal is pending. 
While he has not yet received a final removal order, ICE has discretion to detain him during “removal proceedings,” his current status., Genovese said. 
That said, given the sheer number of people currently in “removal proceedings” with pending appeals, ICE typically would not find and detain people until a final removal order is issued, Genovese said. 
New Mexico sheriffs respond to federal ‘sanctuary’ list

ICE, “for very real capacity reasons, given the limited number of beds nationwide and the millions of cases pending at immigration court, frequently exercised discretion in the form of releasing people on their own recognizance pending their removal proceedings,” Genovese said
But President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportation has removed ICE’s choice about when and where to arrest people, she said. 
“It’s changed now under the Trump administration, where there is a mandate, a requirement, that ICE make thousands of arrests per day,” she said. “And they are targeting people with active removal proceedings, many of whom do not have any sort of interaction with law enforcement which would trigger mandatory detention.”
‘We came here for a better future’
Carrero-Marquez’s daughter recently celebrated graduation at a South Valley school. His wife shared a picture showing the three of them smiling, with her in a graduation gown. 
Since witnessing her father’s arrest, the girl is depressed, Diaz-Ortiz said, and afraid of anyone who looks like a police officer. 
Diaz-Ortiz doesn’t know whether ICE will come next for her or her daughter, whether she should enroll her daughter back in school or what to do next. But she still has to work. 
On Tuesday, she took her daughter along with her as she made deliveries for DoorDash, she said, suddenly the sole caregiver and sole income earner in her family. 
Amid the confusion and uncertainty about her husband’s whereabouts, Diaz-Ortiz said she is terrified about the prospect of him being deported back to Venezuela due to his injuries and the government’s repressive policies.
“In Venezuela you can’t speak freely or say what you want because they attack you,” she said. “We came here for a better future.”

(DNRC photo)A fire near Helena is now 77% contained and was found to be human caused, according to a state press release this week.
Crews completed a line around the Hilger Valley fire on Thursday and were looking for hot spots. Helicopters were used throughout the week to make water drops on the fire, getting their water from nearby Upper Colter Lake.
The fire was initially spotted on Monday and quickly grew through the afternoon before crews were able to get a handle on it. The blaze was listed at 295 acres as of Friday morning. At its peak, nearly 200 personnel were assigned to work the fire.
The Hilger Valley Fire is 20 miles north of Helena, east of Interstate 15 near the Gates of the Mountains exit. The fire cost around $1.5 million to fight and threatened communication infrastructure, according to the National Interagency Fire Center’s daily fire report. It’s expected to be contained by June 20, the report added. The DNRC County Assist Team gave control back to Helena DNRC on Thursday, which will monitor the fire during the coming days.
Several early fires, including one near Wisdom and another near Plains have burned several thousand acres in Montana already this year. Fire officials have said the May and June wildfire starts are early and crews are expecting a long fire season.
Canadian fires, bringing smoke, have already burned more than 7 million acres this year.

(Photo by Danita Delimont/Getty Images)It’s rare enough to have environmental victories of any kind these days. Yet, while many environmental groups have decided to deal with the current administration by keeping their heads down, the Alliance for the Wild Rockies is fighting even harder — and winning!
When the Manti–La Sal National Forest issued its decision to log, masticate (grinding trees down to stumps), and burn across 952,115 acres — a stunning 1,487 square miles, which is more than two-thirds of the 1,413,111-acre forest — we filed suit in federal court. 
We’re overjoyed to announce the Forest Service decided to drop the project. Why? Because the agency knew it would lose in court since the area slated for habitat destruction included 454,452 acres — 710 square miles — of Federal Inventoried Roadless Areas that provide essential habitat for bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, bears, raptors, and birds, including the imperiled pinyon jay.
The Manti-La Sal National Forest stretches from central to southeastern Utah and into Colorado and contains the La Sal Mountains, the state’s second highest mountain range that includes areas in the Bears Ears National Monument.
Given the stunning beauty of this area one might credibly wonder why the Forest Service ever authorized this project. Although calling it “restoration” the project actually authorized mass logging and burning of conifers and aspens, including 170,000 acres of pinyon-juniper forest.
Pinyon jays are unique and social birds that travel in large flocks and play a significant role in maintaining the biodiversity of the West. But like many bird species, Pinyon jay populations have declined by 85% in the last 50 years due to habitat destruction. Ironically, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently issued a decision that pinyon jays may be warranted to be listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act because of loss of their habitat to projects like this.
While the Forest Service is very gung-ho on make-work “management” projects that destroy habitat, pinyon jays actually enhance their habitat by collecting and burying caches of piñon seeds, known as pine nuts. Because they don’t retrieve all the seeds they bury, many germinate and replenish the pinyon-juniper woodlands that are critical for their survival. 
This project was such a huge threat to the Manti-La Sal’s beautiful and biologically diverse roadless forests that the Castle Valley town council passed a resolution supporting our lawsuit, in large part to protect its critical watershed, which is fed by mountain snowpack in our ever hotter and drier climate.
Normally, those who prevail in lawsuits against the government are entitled by law to have their costs reimbursed. But because the Forest Service pulled this project prior to a court ruling, the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and our co-Plaintiffs Native Ecosystems Council, Wildlands Defense, and Council on Fish and Wildlife will not recover our attorney fees.
The Alliance caught the Forest Service breaking the law, we sued, and the agency caved. While this is a great victory for wildlife and their habitat, it’s a mystery why the Forest Service forced us to sue rather than heed our comments, which clearly stated the agency was breaking the law.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-683747825-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 17:38:53.411919
,California,2025-06-13 21:14:30+00:00,CalMatters,He misled the public about his last big immigration sweep. Now he’s leading the Border Patrol in LA,"Andrew Donohue, Sergio Olmos and Wendy Fry",,,,,https://calmatters.org/investigation/2025/06/los-angeles-border-patrol-chief/,"The immigration raids across Los Angeles have all the hallmarks of Gregory Bovino's Kern County sweep, which a federal judge says likely violated the Constitution.","In summary
The immigration raids across Los Angeles have all the hallmarks of Gregory Bovino’s Kern County sweep, which a federal judge says likely violated the Constitution. 


The day after Congress certified President Donald Trump’s victory, Gregory Bovino led his Border Patrol agents hundreds of miles north, sweeping through Kern County in an audacious immigration raid that shocked the local agricultural community. 
At the time, Bovino, chief of the El Centro sector, said that his agents had a “predetermined list of targets,” many of whom had criminal records, before they set off for Kern County. “We did our homework,” he said. 
In the weeks after, both the factual and legal foundation of Bovino’s bold sweep crumbled. Border Patrol documents obtained by CalMatters showed that 77 of the 78 people his agents arrested had no prior record with the agency. 
Then, a federal judge ruled the wide-net sweep – based on random, warrantless stops where day laborers and farm workers congregate – likely violated the Constitution’s protection against unreasonable searches. Lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security promised to re-train Bovino’s 900-plus agents on the Constitution. But that wasn’t enough. The judge issued an injunction forbidding the Border Patrol from conducting similar raids in California’s Central Valley. 
“You just can’t walk up to people with brown skin and say, ‘Give me your papers,’” said U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer L. Thurston.
It appears Bovino’s stock has only risen within the Trump administration since. 
On Thursday, Bovino – in his green uniform, with his high-and-tight hairdo – stood next to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and announced that he has been in charge of Customs and Border Protection operations in Los Angeles. Indeed, the immigration raids that sparked the protests have all the hallmarks of Bovino’s Kern County operation. 
Federal agents picked up day laborers outside of a Home Depot in Westlake. They went after car wash workers in Los Angeles and garment workers in Downtown LA. And farm workers have reported that Border Patrol agents have been conducting operations around the strawberry fields of Oxnard.  
Bovino doesn’t distinguish between field workers or paleteros and fentanyl dealers. To him, they all fit one category: “Bad people.”
“For Customs and Border Protection, that’s why we are here right now, is to remove those bad people and bad things, whether illegal aliens, drugs or otherwise,” he said at the press conference Thursday. “We are here and we’re not going away.” 
At this point, Bovino’s rapid rise from one of 20 section chiefs around the country to the face of Trump’s aggressive immigration sweeps in Los Angeles almost seems inevitable. His team employs a group of five agents to make videos, cranking out dramatic, fictionalized videos portraying migrants crossing the border as menaces with a bloodlust to commit crimes. 
Bovino seems to relish the camera himself. The El Centro sector posts staged photos of him in uniform, including a closeup with an AR-15, and one on a white horse in the desert, cradling a shotgun. In an interview with CalMatters in February, flanked by a wall of armed agents, he taunted his other Border Patrol counterparts. “Twenty sectors in the U.S. Border Patrol, and we do call ourselves the ‘Premiere Sector,’” he said with a smile. “So please let those other chiefs know we said that.”  


Bovino likes to praise President Dwight Eisenhower, who led the largest deportation in American history, rounding up 1.3 million Mexicans and Mexican Americans in 1954. The first buses deporting migrants – in what was called “Operation Wetback” – rolled out of El Centro over 70 years ago. 
The Kern County raids were pitched as a “proof of concept” for how the Border Patrol could be mobilized for mass deportation operations away from the border. It’s exactly the kind of operation that, according to the Wall Street Journal, top White House aide Steven Miller wanted to see when he convened top immigration officials in late May and demanded more aggressive action. Miller, the Journal reported, told officials they didn’t need targeted lists of immigrants – they should instead just go to Home Depots, inspiring the LA raids. 
Now, Bovino, at the same press conference in which agents handcuffed Sen. Alex Padilla after the senator tried asking questions of Noem, said he’s sticking around.
“You’ll continue to see us in Los Angeles,” he said. “Not going anywhere soon.” 
A new series of raids in California
Bovino labeled the Kern County sweeps “Operation Return to Sender.” Over three days, his agents detained day laborers, farm workers and others in a Home Depot parking lot, outside a convenience store and along a highway between orchards.  
The ACLU sued on behalf of United Farm Workers, arguing that the indiscriminate stops violated the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. 
The judge hasn’t yet ruled on the full case, but found the ACLU was likely to succeed, and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Border Patrol agents from taking similar actions. That restricts them from stopping people unless they have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in violation of U.S. immigration law. It also bars agents from carrying out warrantless arrests unless they have probable cause that the person is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. 
The injunction only applies to the Central Valley, but similar legal challenges could await after the latest wave of sweeps.
Advocates are still trying to get a handle on the scope and details of federal actions over the last week. 
Just after dawn on Tuesday, Border Patrol agents and other federal officers swept across Ventura, Kern, and Tulare counties, according to the United Farm Workers. 
UFW provided CalMatters with a video that shows a white and green Border Patrol truck pulling up to a business in Moorpark. Two masked agents emerged and arrested a man in a baseball cap and neon yellow work shirt who was opening the gate just before 9 a.m.
A video shared on social media by ABC7 shows officers in green Border Patrol uniforms chasing a farmworker through an Oxnard field. Another video shot from a different angle shows a green and white Border Patrol truck racing along the edge of the farm fields. 
The agents appear to catch the worker, but it is unclear what happens after that. “There’s a lot we don’t know yet,” said Antonio de Loera-Brust, a spokesman for UFW. The labor union representing farm workers is working to contact families affected by the raids. 
Other videos show white and green vehicles typically used by Border Patrol, but so far, the agency has not confirmed their participation. A spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency for Border Patrol, told CalMatters to direct our questions to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A spokesperson for ICE told CalMatters to contact Customs and Border Protection with our questions. 
“We’ve seen videos of Border Patrol trucks tearing through farmlands. I’ve heard reports of operations in farmlands, and we’re still investigating if the court’s order has been violated,” said Bree Bernwanger, an attorney with ACLU Northern California, which brought the Kern County suit.
“The Fourth Amendment really prohibits immigration agents from doing sweeps of communities, from doing racial profiling, from targeting people just because they’re Brown or looking like a farm worker.”
Oxnard Mayor Luis McArthur said his office has also received disturbing reports of immigration officials trying to enter agricultural fields and conducting vehicle stops. 
“These actions are completely unjustified and harmful. They create chaos and distress in our community without contributing to public safety,” he said. “The individuals affected by these operations; they’re not criminals. They’re hardworking families who make meaningful contributions to our local economy and to our greater community.”
Elizabeth Strater, vice president of the UFW, said that a number of employers stopped federal agents from accessing their land. 
“All across California one thing that is good to hear is that we can confirm in a number of locations federal agents attempted to enter a worksite and were repelled because the employer took the practical steps, like gates, and told the agents that they couldn’t come onto the property,” she said. 
In February, Bovino denied that his agents had gone after farmworkers. 
“For us, targeting agricultural workers at their job, absolutely not. That has no merit,” he said. “But when Border Patrol comes into contact with illegal aliens, you’re going to get arrested.”
He promised to take his fight across the state. “Our area goes through Central California all the way to the Oregon border, so anywhere in that area, we are going to go where that threat is, and where we can do the most damage to bad people and bad things as we possibly can,” Bovino said. 
For now, that’s Los Angeles. Bovino said at the Thursday press conference he had several hundred agents and officers there. 
“Many millions of illegal aliens have passed across that border over the past several years. It’s our job to get them out,” he said. “And that’s what we’re going to do and what we’re doing right now.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061325_Gregory-Bovino_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-13 17:38:53.411919

We look at the digits.","Workers with Health Care for the Homeless offer water, education and treatment to unsheltered New Mexicans in Albuquerque in response to high heat risk. (Courtesy of Health Care for the Homeless / Sara Lucero)Parts of New Mexico will get their first encounters with intense heat this weekend, including projected temperatures of 103 and 104 degrees in Las Cruces. 
The temperatures will be dangerously hot in some places, according to the National Weather Service’s Heat Risk Map. The map takes into account how unusual the heat is at a given time of year, how long it will last into the day and night and whether those temperatures pose a higher risk of heat-related impacts based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Local New Mexico officials told Source New Mexico earlier this week that they’re monitoring for heat threats and ready to take action during extreme heat.
Rio Rancho, Albuquerque and Las Cruces recently topped a USA Today analysis of cities with the largest increase of high-heat days — 90 degrees and upward — since 1985: 39, 36 and 31 more such days, respectively.
According to the Heat Risk Map, areas in and around Las Cruces will be so hot that they’ll turn from “red” to “magenta” beginning Monday, June 16. Areas can reach this “extreme” level of heat with rare or long-duration extreme heat with little overnight relief. 

 
 
 

Heat at the “magenta” level “affects anyone without effective cooling and/or adequate hydration. Impacts likely in most health systems, heat-sensitive industries and infrastructure,” the National Weather Service warns.
Despite the extreme temperatures predicted, local officials in Las Cruces told Source that, as of Wednesday,  they did not plan to extend cooling center hours, unless a power outage or further needs arise.
Heat of the Moment

Doña Ana Assistant County Manager Steven Lopez said recent temperatures have not reached a threshold of 105 degrees on the heat index. The county requires those high temperatures for several days to provide additional cooling sites, he said.
Dangerously hot temperatures forecasted in the coming days have nonprofit advocates and providers bracing for “life or death” impacts to unhoused people in New Mexico’s largest cities. Advocates said governments at all levels need policies, funding and data to better address the threat.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0198-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 17:38:53.411919
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-13 21:00:27+00:00,CT Mirror,CT urban mayors take different approaches to getting state funds,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/13/new-haven-hartford-ct-education-funding/,"One mayor says thanks, another complains. But both are advocating for their cities and seeking changes to public education funding in CT.","A week after New Haven’s mayor decried the inadequacy of state funding for local education, Hartford’s mayor came to the state Capitol office of House Speaker Matt Ritter to publicly offer thanks for the positive impact the recently adopted budget will have on his city.
“I come up to the Capitol very often to ask for things,” Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam said.
“You’re nicer than some mayors,” Ritter said, smiling.
“My mom told me, taught me, that if you are willing to ask for something, you better say thank you when you get it, and we’re here to say thank you,” Arulampalam said.
Behind the political politesse is the challenge of urban mayors to advocate for immediate needs, while also playing the longer game of seeking structural changes in how Connecticut meets its constitutional responsibility of equitably funding public education.
“The state has an obligation, constitutionally, to fund public education with regard to equity, and we don’t. We just don’t,” said Joe DeLong, the executive director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
DeLong was not party to Elicker’s denunciation of Gov. Ned Lamont’s refusal to raise taxes and provide greater funding for education, nor the press conference Arulampalam sought to publicize some of the fiscal relief coming to Hartford. But he understands both points of view.
The state both increased funding for special education and accelerated by one year the commitment to fully funding the Education Cost Sharing formula, through which most state aid for local education flows.
For Hartford, that means $3.4 million more for special education and an additional $2.8 million in ECS money. There is an other $8 million in new funding for the city, including $1 million that will be matched for the city to once again employ 800 young people in summer jobs.
“It’s a significant investment in our youth. It’s a significant investment in violence prevention in our city. It has so many layers of impact, and we really appreciate the legislature coming through,” Arulampalam said.
Ritter, a Democrat from Hartford, had expressed annoyance last week at Elicker’s complaint. On Friday, the former city council leader said he understood Elicker’s larger frustrations with the inability of the General Assembly to make more dramatic changes in funding schools.
“I have a lot of respect for all the mayors. I know what a hard job it is,” Ritter said. “So this is not a knock or a dig at anybody. What I would say, though, is that incremental progress in the legislature is often what happens. And so the idea that a group can ask for a half a billion dollars in one year is just not practical.”
Urban legislators are not a majority in the the General Assembly, but both chambers are led by urban Democrats: Ritter in the House, and Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney of New Haven in the Senate.
DeLong said the notion of incremental change and progress is reasonable, but it must be viewed in a larger picture: The ECS formula has not been changed significantly since 2013, and inflation means that the state’s share of K-12 funding actually shrinks some years even as over spending goes up.
Connecticut’s 36% state share of financing public schools is one of the lowest in the U.S.
“I wish I could walk in the legislature and get $545 million in a new Educational Cost Sharing formula. We have to, as leaders, deal with the realities in front of us,” Arulampalam said. 
Elicker said Friday his criticism was not directed at the legislative leaders, who were constrained by the governor’s refusal to consider higher taxes.
“We need to think big, and we need to act big,” Elicker said. “An unwillingness to raise taxes at the state level means raising them at the local level.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7869-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)Chants of “Todos somos Kilmar” — “we are all Kilmar” — punctuated a gathering of immigrant, labor, faith and civil rights organizations who gathered at a downtown Nashville church Friday ahead of Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s arraignment.
Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran native living in Maryland, was detained after a traffic stop in March and then deported to a Salvadoran prison under accusations of being a member of the MS-13 criminal gang.
His deportation — which a Trump administration attorney admitted was done in error — has become a lightning rod for public opposition to the administration’s immigration policies.
“Let’s be clear: We are fighting because they are continuing to call this an administrative error, but there’s nothing administrative about destroying a family, and this is not an error,”  Lydia Walther-Rodriguez, a leader with  immigrant advocacy group CASA Maryland, said. 
“This is an intentional attack to Black and brown communities. Not just in Maryland, but all throughout this country, they are continuing to fight to erase us, and we must continue to stand up and resist,” she said.
Abrego Garcia came to the United States illegally as a teenager. A 2019 immigration court order barred the government from sending him back to El Salvador, where he said he feared persecution.
The El Salvador government returned Abrego Garcia to the United States in June to face human smuggling charges issued in a grand jury indictment in late May. The charges stem from a 2022 incident when the Tennessee Highway Patrol pulled over Abrego Garcia’s SUV — which had nine Hispanic men inside — for speeding.
He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment at a Nashville federal courthouse Friday.
The group of organizations that met on the steps of the First Lutheran Church also included the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRRC), SEIU Local 205, Central Labor Council of Nashville and Middle Tennessee and The Equity Alliance.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)
Vonda McDaniel, president of the Central Labor Council of Nashville and Middle Tennessee, demanded fair treatment for Abrego Garcia, saying his case will not “disappear in the shadows of a courtroom.” She also questioned the legitimacy of the charges against him, which were filed after his deportation.
“This is a clear attempt to criminalize Kilmar retroactively in order to justify what they did to him illegally, and to intimidate other immigrants (and) workers who might dare to fight back when their rights are violated … Today, we stand before you to demand justice, not vengeance,” McDaniel said.
Speakers: turmoil in Nashville reflects broader pattern
TIRRC Executive Director Lisa Sherman Luna spoke of the Tennessee legislature’s recent actions, including a law that created an immigration enforcement division that is exempt from public records and created criminal penalties for local elected officials who “adopt sanctuary policies.” Another law created a new crime for harboring or hiding immigrants without legal immigration status “for the purpose … of private financial gain.”
“What happened to Kilmar Garcia is a chilling example of what could happen to any one of us, because it’s exactly what happens when those in power put themselves above the law, when court orders are ignored, when people are disappeared, when due process is erased,” she said. “Right now, immigrants are being used as pawns in a broader assault on our democracy.”
Sherman Luna said Nashville specifically has been under “full-scale assault” since ICE detained around 200 people, most of whom had no criminal records, from the city’s most diverse neighborhoods in May. 
U.S. “border czar” Tom Homan, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton and Trump administration officials have since denounced Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell for condemning the immigration detention sweep. 
‘There will be repercussions’ Homeland Security official targets Nashville mayor over immigration

After the detainments, O’Connell revised a 2019 executive order that requires some city employees to report interactions with federal immigration officials to the mayor’s office, shortening the original 3-day timeframe to 24 hours. The mayor’s office posted records of these reports, which inadvertently included the names of three federal immigration officials and one official’s first name, according to O’Connell’s administration. The posts were later removed.
Tennessee GOP leaders have accused O’Connell of endangering immigration officials and interfering with immigration enforcement.
O’Connell now faces an investigation by a U.S. Congressional committee, and Tennessee Republican state lawmakers have proposed legislation that would make it a felony for public officials to release immigration officers’ names. The bill would also remove state and local officials from office. 
“They criminalized the ability of local elected officials to protect immigrant residents, and now they’re trying to make it a crime to even release the names of ICE officers, people with immense power operating without any public oversight,” Sherman Luna said. “This is what governments do when they know they’re acting outside of the law, when they’re trampling on our rights (and) they want to do it with total impunity.”
District 17 Metro Nashville Council member Terry Vo, who chairs the Immigrant Caucus, said the state legislature “has already stripped Tennessee cities of the right to take care of our people, from banning sanctuary policies to restricting (minimum wage increases) and to blocking worker protections.”
Cities in Tennessee and throughout the nation, she said, cannot “comply in advance.”
“Let’s not forget the freedoms we enjoy now were not gifted to us,” Vo said. “They were fought for. They were sacrificed for.”
Tequila Johnson, co-founder and vice president of The Equity Alliance, said it’s the same system that “locks up Black bodies” and “is deporting immigrant families.”
“We owe it to our ancestors … to the people who died, who fought for these rights, to continue fighting,” Johnson said. “Because just because hate isn’t knocking at your door right now, doesn’t mean it’s not on your street.”

The counterclaim filed by Barletta Heavy Division Inc. and Aetna Bridge Company in Providence […]","Traffic flows in both directions on Interstate 195 on the eastbound side of the Washington Bridge on Friday, June 13, 2025, at 3:50 p.m. Demolition work that has removed much of the westbound side of the Washington Bridge is expected to be completed in December. (Rhode Island Department of Transportation Traffic Camera)Two of the 13 firms being sued by the state for allegedly doing negligent work on the westbound Washington Bridge have filed a counterclaim, alleging the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) failed to tell them about a key inspection report.
The counterclaim filed by Barletta Heavy Division Inc. and Aetna Bridge Company in Providence County Superior Court Thursday argues they should have been alerted to the findings of a January 1992 report by Lichtenstein & Associates, at the time they bid for the state’s $78 million contract to rehabilitate the Washington Bridge in 2021.
The 1992 report was cited by the state in its lawsuit against the firms, claiming they all should have known about deterioration in the concrete drop-in beams and signs of distress in the grout and cantilever beams that were eventually deemed a risk to the bridge’s structural integrity. The westbound span on Interstate 195 was closed in December 2023 when engineers determined the bridge was at risk of collapsing.
“RIDOT knew or should have known, or ought to have known, that the Washington Bridge incorporated a unique design that limited the ability to determine its condition from visual inspections alone,” the counterclaim states.
The westbound bridge is expected to be rebuilt by November 2028 and cost up to $427 million. Chicago-headquartered Walsh Construction Company was awarded the state’s contract on June 6 after two attempts by Gov. Dan McKee’s administration to secure a bridge builder.
Work is scheduled to begin in July, which overlaps with the ongoing demolition of the existing bridge by Aetna, which is among the 13 firms being sued by the state. The Warwick-based contractor is expected to complete its work by the end of 2025.
Barletta and Aetna claim the state concealed the true condition of the bridge and neglected to conduct the appropriate testing ahead of issuing a request for proposals in 2021. Instead, the companies allege that they received a project scope which did not identify any structural deficiencies with the post-tensioning system.
The 1992 report called for RIDOT to perform additional radiographic and other evaluation of the Washington Bridge before any future attempts to rehabilitate the span over the Seekonk River.
“The Rhode Island Department of Transportation may have averted a costly and disastrous emergency closure of the Washington Bridge last December if it had followed recommendations in a detailed 1992 inspection report,” Barletta spokesperson Sallie Hofmeister said in an emailed statement.
Because of the state’s alleged failure to investigate the bridge, Barletta and Aetna claim they were deprived of incentives available after successful completion of the initial rehabilitation project. The two firms have asked the court to issue a judgment against the state for all of its damages plus interest.
The state’s initial August 2024 complaint seeks to recover damages based on alleged economic losses and physical damages, along with breaches of contracts. 
RIDOT spokesperson Charles St. Martin deferred comment to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office, which is handling the state’s case. 
“Counterclaims are to be expected in a case like this,” Timothy Rondeau, a spokesperson for the AG’s office, said in an emailed statement.“The state stands by the allegations in its complaint. As this is part of ongoing litigation, we have no further comment.”

“Everything that they told me was that, yes, it’s an insecure facility. They do not have confidence in this facility, which is why they’re doing a security review, and it looks like moving most, if not all, of the detainees out of there while they do a review in that process,” Kim said. 
Four detainees escaped through a wall, made of drywall and mesh, that had toppled in the chaos, Kim said.

“It shows just how shoddy the construction was here, what happens when we are paying billions of dollars for for-profit prisons that are skirting the responsibilities they have and try to pocket as much of that money as possible,” Kim told protestors gathered outside the jail Friday morning. 
The Department of Homeland Security said the four escaped prisoners remain at large, but did not comment on Kim’s concerns or the transfer of detainees. A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson did not respond for comment. 
DHS officials also refuted claims of a chaotic night, despite video posted on social media that included authorities pepper-spraying activists and journalists and protesters forming a human barricade to prevent cars from entering the facility on Doremus Avenue in an industrial section of Newark. 
“Contrary to current reporting, there has been no widespread unrest at the Delaney Hall Detention facility. This privately held facility remains dedicated to providing high-quality services, including include around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietician-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice their religious beliefs,” Homeland Security officials said. 
Vans and buses lined up Friday morning alongside the jail to move detainees out. It’s unclear where they will be taken. New Jersey is home to one other migrant jail, the Elizabeth Detention Center. 
Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed facility, was the first immigration detention facility to open under President Donald Trump. The facility, run by prison operator Geo Group, opened just as the Trump administration ramped up efforts to mass detain and deport immigrants.
Backlash began even before it opened, and near-daily protests have cropped up outside since it started housing migrants in May. 
Newark officials sued Geo Group, claiming it lacked the proper city permits and inspections to open, including a certificate of occupancy. 
The facility captured national attention when Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested and detained for five hours after attempting to enter. While a judge later dismissed his charges, federal authorities charged Rep. LaMonica McIver with felony assault over a scuffle that occurred when agents handcuffed Baraka. 
In a statement early Friday, Baraka demanded answers from Geo Group and the Department of Homeland Security and urged authorities to “not allow this operation to continue unchecked.” 
“This entire situation lacks sufficient oversight of every basic detail — including local zoning laws and fundamental constitutional rights. This is why city officials and our congressional delegation need to be allowed entry to observe and monitor, and why private prisons pose a very real problem to our state and its constitution,” he said. 
Kim echoed concerns that Geo Group was “cutting corners” in a rush to open the facility.
“We need to see what exactly is going to be the future of this place and whether or not there will still be detainees in here past this weekend,” Kim said.
A Geo Group spokesman did not respond Friday to a request for comment, but has said the facility holds a valid certificate of occupancy and complies with health and safety requirements.
Lawyers barred from entering Delaney Hall
Attorneys were turned away from the facility Friday by guards. 
Franklin S. Montero, a Clifton-based immigration attorney, was there for his first visit with a client. 
When he arrived at the gate, guards told him a directive prohibited them from allowing anyone inside and offered no information on when he could enter. That means his client won’t be able to sign necessary petitions and documents before a hearing, he said.
“Never, never, never have I seen this before. In my years of practicing immigration law, I’ve always been able to get inside the facility and meet with my client,” Montero said. “Even during COVID. It’s just — it’s not normal, I’ll tell you that.”
Mustafa Cetin represents a man who has lived in South Jersey since 2022 and was detained during a routine check-in with immigration officials. His client now wants to be released to return to Turkey, Cetin said.
Cetin also got turned away from a scheduled meeting with his client Friday afternoon. He said that’s a due process issue that could be fought in court. 
“I don’t think that’s legal. That should be decided by a court if it’s reasonable for them to do that or not — weighing due process rights, our access to our clients, and them having the resources,” he said.

Lawmakers on the powerful budget-writing committee went back and forth for nearly three hours about the plans with Republicans saying they made significant investments in education and would help Wisconsinites while Democrats argued the state should do more for schools. 
Over $220 million for special education, no additional general aid for schools
The committee approved a total of about $336 million total in new general purpose revenue for Wisconsin’s K-12 schools — only about 10% of Gov. Tony Evers’ proposed $3.1 billion in new spending.
Special education costs will receive the majority of the allocation with an additional $220 million that will be split between the general special education reimbursement and a subset of high-cost special education services. 
The special education reimbursement funding includes $77.2 million in the first year of the budget, which will bring the rate at which the state reimburses school districts to an estimated 35%, and $151 million in the second year bringing the rate to an estimated 37.5%. It’s well below the $1.13 billion or 60% reimbursement for special education that Evers had proposed and that advocates had said was essential to place school districts back on a sustainable funding path. 
Education advocates spent the last week lobbying for the additional funding — and warning lawmakers about the financial strain on districts and the resources the students could lose. Ahead of the meeting Thursday, Democrats and a coalition of Wisconsin parents of students with disabilities spoke to the urgent need for additional investment in the state’s general special education reimbursement rate. 
“Everywhere we’ve gone in the state of Wisconsin, whether it’s rural school districts, urban school districts, whether it’s school districts that have passed referendums and those that haven’t, they all say the same thing — 60% primary special education funding is absolutely necessary for our schools to succeed,” Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said at the press conference.  “You can see that we have had a cycle of referendum throughout Wisconsin, and that cycle has to end.”

The special education reimbursement peaked at 70% in 1973, according to the Wisconsin Policy Forum. After falling to a low of 24.9% in 2015-16, the state’s share of special education costs has been incrementally increasing with some fluctuations. 
The Republican proposal represents, at maximum, about a 5% increase to the current rate by the second year. According to budget papers prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the investment lawmakers made last session was meant to bring the rate to 33.3%, but because it is a sum certain rate — meaning there was only a set amount of money set aside, regardless of expanding costs  — the actual rates have been 32.4% in 2023-24 and an estimated 32.1% for 2024-25.
Joint Finance Co-Chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said at a press conference ahead of the meeting that he would tell advocates who wanted the 60% rate that the state budget has to be “right-sized” and “affordable.”
“The governor’s budget has always [had] reckless spending that the state can’t afford, and so we’re choosing to make key investments and priorities, and these investments today will be some of … the largest investments you’ll see in the budget,” Born said. 
The committee also added $54.5 million to bring the additional reimbursement rate for a small number of high-cost special education services to 50% in the first year of the budget and 90% in the second year. The high-cost special education program provides additional aid when costs exceed $30,000 for a single student in one year. According to DPI, in 2025 only 3% of students with disabilities fell in the high-cost special education category.
In 2024-25, the program only received $14.5 million from the state. Evers had proposed the state invest an additional $18.5 million. 
Republicans on the committee insisted that they were trying to compromise and making a significant investment in schools — noting that education likely will continue being the state’s top expenditure in the budget. Meanwhile, Democrats spoke extensively about the need for higher rates of investment, read messages from superintendents and students in their districts and said Republicans were not doing what people asked for. 
“High needs special education funding only reaches about 3% of Wisconsin’s special education students,” Rep. Deb Andraca said. “You’re getting a couple good talking points, but you’re not going to get the kinds of public schools that Wisconsin kids deserve.” 
During the committee meeting, Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) criticized Democrats for saying they would vote against the proposals. He said Democrats would vote against any proposal if it isn’t what they want. 
“If we all voted no, we would return to base funding, which was good enough by the way for the governor last budget because he signed it,” Bradley said. “There would be no increases, but instead we’ve introduced a motion which will increase funding.”
McGuire responded by saying he wouldn’t vote for a proposal that is “condemning the state to continuing the cycle of referendum,” which he said Republicans are doing by minimally increasing the special education reimbursement rate and not investing any additional money in general aid. 
“Wisconsinites across the state are having to choose between raising their own property taxes” and the schools, McGuire said. 
The Kenosha School District, which is in McGuire’s legislative district, recently failed to pass referendum to help reduce a budget deficit. School leaders had said a significant increase in the special education reimbursement would prevent the district from having to seek a referendum again.
“They had a $19 million budget gap, and if this state went to 60% special education funding, you know roughly where we promised we would be, that would’ve gone down to $6 million,” McGuire said, “…$13 million of those dollars are our responsibility. That’s been our failing, and we should live up to that.”
“What are we arguing about? We’re putting more money in,” Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) said.“I would think that when this gets to his desk, Evers would sign this because it is a bigger increase than any of what he proposed while he was state superintendent.”
McGuire said the investment in the high-cost special education is also good, but only applies to a small number of schools and students. 
“You know, what would benefit all school districts in the state and will benefit all students who need special education? The primary special education reimbursement rate, which you put at 37.5[%], but everyone says should be at 60[%].” McGuire said. “I don’t think this is your intention, but I don’t believe that we should be exchanging children who need our assistance for other children who need our assistance. Why can’t we just help all of the kids who need our help?”
Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) said that the increase for high-cost special education will have a significant impact on some schools, especially smaller ones, and students, even if it’s not many of them.
“To get 90% for them is huge for any of our rural districts. One child, which deserves an education, can break the bank for our small districts,” Kurtz said. “Is it perfect? No, it’s not perfect, but we have to stay within our means.” 
Committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) echoed Kurtz’s comments saying that there will be “a lot of districts that are going to be awful happy about that.” 
“They’ve been worried about sometimes, a student moves into the district, and it’s of incredibly high, high needs,” Marklein said.
The committee also declined to include additional general aid for school districts. Republicans on the committee said  there was already a $325 per pupil increase to districts’ revenue limits built into the budget from last session due to Evers’ partial veto. The increase gives districts the option to raise property taxes, though it doesn’t require them to, and does not include state funding for the increase.
Sen. Romaine Quinn (R-Birchwood) told lawmakers not to forget about the increase, saying the “insulting part about that is that everyone gets it.
There are schools that don’t need that,” Quinn said. “72% of my districts spend less than [the schools of] my Democratic colleagues on this panel.” 
School Administrators Alliance Executive Director Dee Pettack, Wisconsin Association of School Boards Executive Director Dan Rossmiller, Southeast Wisconsin School Alliance Executive Director Cathy Olig and Wisconsin Rural Schools Alliance Executive Director Jeff Eide said in a joint letter reacting to the proposal that lawmakers failed to hear the voices school leaders, parents and community and business leaders.
“While the $325 revenue limit authority exists, it is not funded by the state. Instead, it is entirely borne by local property taxpayers. In addition, school districts will not see the requested support in special education,” the leaders stated. “Because of the lack of state support in these two critical areas, school districts will be left with no choice but to ask their local taxpayers to step up and shoulder the costs locally, regardless of their ability to pay.” 
The leaders said the state was investing minimally and school districts will continue to struggle to fund mandated primary special education programs.
State Superintendent Jill Underly called the Republicans’ proposal “irresponsible” in a statement Friday and said it “puts politics ahead of kids and disregards educators and public schools when they need support the most.”
“Our public schools desperately need and deserve funding that is flexible, spendable and predictable,” Underly said. “This budget fails to deliver on all three. Once again, those in power had an opportunity to do right by Wisconsin’s children — and once again, they turned their backs on them.” 
The committee also approved $30 million for the state’s choice school programs, $20 million for mental health services in school, $250,000 for robotics league grants, $750,000 for a single school, the Lakeland STAR Academy (a provision that Evers vetoed last session), $100,000 for Special Olympics Wisconsin, $3 million for public library system aid, $500,000 for recovery high schools and $500,000 for Wisconsin Reading Corps. 
Over $1 billion in tax cuts 
Republican lawmakers also approved tax cuts of about $1.3 billion for the budget Thursday evening after 8 p.m., including changes to the income tax brackets and a cut for retirees in Wisconsin.
Born and Marklein said the cuts would help retirees and other Wisconsinites afford to stay in the state.
“These are average, hard-working people in our state that will benefit from our tax cut,” Marklein said. 
The income tax change will allow more people to qualify for the second tax bracket with a rate of 4.4% by raising the qualifying maximum income to $50,480 for single filers, $67,300 for joint filers and $33,650 for married-separate filers. This will reduce the state’s revenues by $323 million in 2025-26 and $320 million in 2026-27. 
People currently eligible for the second tax bracket include: single filers making between $14,680 and $29,370, joint filers making between $19,580 and $39,150 and married separate filers making between $9,790 and $19,580.
Wisconsin Republicans have been seeking another significant tax cut since the last budget cycle when Evers vetoed their proposals. After the rejection, Republicans started to narrow their tax cuts proposals to focus on retirees and a couple of other groups with the hope of getting Evers’ approval. When negotiations on this year’s budget reached an impasse, Evers had said he was willing to support Republicans’ tax goals, but he wanted agreements from them, too. 
The proposal also includes an exclusion from income taxes for retirees that would reduce the state’s revenues by $395 million in 2025-26 and $300 million in 2026-27.
“This isn’t a high-income oriented kind of thing,” Marklein said during the meeting. “It just helps a lot of average people in the state of Wisconsin, so it’s very good tax policy.” 
Democrats appeared unimpressed with the tax proposal. 
The Legislative Fiscal Bureau told lawmakers that the income tax change would lead to about a maximum impact of $253 annually for married joint filers, $190 annually for single filers and $127 for married separate filers. 
“So roughly $5 a week for a married couple,” McGuire said. 
McGuire said that Democrats just have the perspective that Wisconsin could invest more in the priorities that residents have been expressing. 
“We heard from a lot of people about what they need,” McGuire said in reference to school districts. “We also know that as they’ve been attempting to get those funds they’ve had to go to referendums across the state, and… we think that’s harming communities and making it more difficult for people. As a perspective, we believe that that’s a good place to invest in dollars.” 
Tech colleges
The committee also voted to provide additional funding for the Wisconsin technical colleges, though it is, again, significantly less than what was requested by Evers and by the system.
The proposal will provide an additional $13 million to the system. This includes $7 million in general aid for the system of 16 technical colleges, $2 million in aid meant for grants for artificial intelligence, $3 million for grants for textbooks and nearly $30,000 to support the operations of the system. 
Evers had proposed the state provide the system with $45 million in general aid
Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) said the differences between Evers’ proposals and what Republicans offered were stark. 
“We hear my GOP colleagues talk about worker training all the time and this is their opportunity to make sure that our technical colleges have the resources that they need to make sure that we are training an adequate workforce,” Johnson said, noting that the state could be short by 1,000 nurses (many of whom start their education in technical colleges) by 2030. “I’ve never had an employer complain about having an educated workforce, not once, but I have heard employers say that Wisconsin lacks the skill sets and educational skills they need. It seems my Republican colleagues are more concerned with starving our institutions of higher education, rather than making sure they have the resources they need.” 
Testin said the proposal was not a cut and that Republicans were investing in technical colleges. 
“We see there’s value in our technical colleges because they are working with the business community … getting students through the door quicker with less debt,” Testin said. “Any conversations that this is a cut is just unrealistic. These are critical investments in the technical system.”

The owner of a Florida business that sells medical equipment has been indicted in Vermont on federal charges alleging that his company submitted false claims to Medicare for reimbursement.
A federal grand jury in Burlington indicted Donald Jani on Thursday on charges of attempted health care fraud and committing health care fraud. 
Jani was the co-owner of CSS Pain Relief Inc,, a company based in Fort Pierce, Florida, and an enrolled Medicare provider, according to the indictment. Medicare is a federally funded health care program providing medical services to elderly and disabled people across the country.
Jani and other unnamed co-conspirators between August 2020 and April of this year took part in a scheme to defraud Medicare by submitting fraudulent claims for medical equipment, such as back braces and glucose monitors, for his company’s customers, the indictment stated. 
The claims, the charging document stated, were for customers from several parts of the country, including Medicare beneficiaries in Vermont. 
In total, according to the indictment, Jani’s company submitted 2,252 claims for Medicare reimbursement for medical equipment that was “purportedly provided to 894” people throughout the United States. 
The Florida company submitted $1.9 million in Medicare claims and received $790,000 in reimbursements, the filing stated. 
The indictment does not provide a breakdown of how many of the alleged false claims involved Vermonters.
Medicare reimbursements are paid out if a claim has been determined to be medically necessary by a prescribing provider, according to the indictment. The claims submitted by Jani’s company, the filing added, allegedly contained “false representations,” including in cases where medical equipment was never provided to a customer. 
Jani, the indictment stated, has had several roles with the Florida-based company, from president to CEO to owner. Contact information for Jani could not be found Friday. His last known address, according to the charging document, was in India. 
A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont, which is prosecuting the case, did not return messages Friday seeking comment.

Gavin Newsom is seeking to close a $12 billion budget deficit, relying on internal borrowing to put off difficult decisions.","In summary
The California Legislature has rejected many of the spending cuts Gov. Gavin Newsom is seeking to close a $12 billion budget deficit, relying on internal borrowing to put off difficult decisions.


The California Legislature passed a state budget today that relies more on borrowing than spending cuts to close a projected $12 billion deficit, aiming to push off difficult decisions about priorities even as that gap is only expected to grow in future years.
The $325 billion legislative spending plan, which was approved by the Democratic majority along largely partisan lines, is something of a formality, because lawmakers are constitutionally required to pass a balanced budget by June 15 or forgo their pay.
Having rejected many of the cuts to social services that Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed last month to stabilize California’s finances long-term, they must now negotiate a compromise in the coming weeks, with the July 1 start of the fiscal year looming.
The two sides remain billions of dollars apart, particularly on Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for the poor, as well as home health services, public transit, higher education and raises for state workers.
Democratic leaders said they want to delay painful cuts by a few years to give themselves more time to find another solution that doesn’t “balance the budget on the backs of the most vulnerable” — and perhaps, as one lawmaker put it this week, wait for a “miracle” turnaround in California’s economy.
“The worst outcome here, though, would be to make cuts that we ultimately realize we didn’t need to make — to throw people off safety net programs and then come back and realize, you know what, the projections were off, that wasn’t something that was necessary,” Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, the Encino Democrat who chairs the Assembly budget committee, told reporters after the vote. “We could be in a totally different world six months from now.”
A major point of contention is Medi-Cal, which is driving a large portion of the deficit. The state expanded services significantly in recent years and costs are now rising faster than anticipated after more new patients enrolled than projected. Lawmakers allocated billions of dollars in additional funding to the program this spring to keep it solvent.
Newsom proposed major changes to address those structural issues, including freezing enrollment for adults living in the country illegally, who became newly eligible last year, as well as adding a $100 monthly premium and cutting long-term care and dental benefits for those who maintain their coverage. The governor also wants to eliminate coverage for weight loss drugs like Ozempic and reinstate a strict asset test for seniors, which was recently eliminated.
The Legislature has accepted some of those proposals, such as the enrollment freeze and stopping coverage of weight loss drugs, and scaled back others, including the asset test. Lawmakers want to lower the monthly premium for undocumented immigrants to $30, give those who lose their Medi-Cal coverage because they cannot pay it a chance to re-enroll, delay cutting their dental benefits and maintain their long-term care benefits.
Even that potential compromise has been anathema to some Democrats, who spoke out against what they deemed a “two-tiered health care system” during the floor debate, urging a no vote or asking the Legislature to instead consider raising taxes on billionaires.
“We cannot contribute to the fear and suffering of communities across our state, and I implore us to consider alternatives,” said Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez, an Arleta Democrat, who was nearly in tears as she told her colleagues that she was offended by the budget bill.
The legislative plan also rejects a Newsom proposal to cap overtime hours for in-home supportive service providers and eliminate those benefits for adults living in the country illegally. 
It restores funding the governor had sought to eliminate for family planning clinics; the University of California, California State University and student financial aid; and public transit. It moves forward with $767 million in raises for state employees that Newsom asked to pause and introduces funding for other legislative priorities, including more than $900 million for affordable housing construction and mortgage assistance for first-time homebuyers. It proposes lending up to $1.75 billion from the state for local governments in Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area transit agencies dealing with their own budget crunches.
All of that would add billions of dollars in spending, next year and ongoing, above Newsom’s plan — which already relies on shifting money meant to pay for climate projects and Medi-Cal provider reimbursements, and pulling $7.1 billion out of a rainy-day reserve fund to close the revenue gap. To pay for it, the Legislature seeks to borrow even more from state special funds.

Their approach could be difficult to maintain given the state’s grim fiscal outlook, with an annual budget shortfall projected to grow to $30 billion within the next three years. Turmoil in the stock market and key California industries caused by Trump’s sweeping new tariffs, as well as anticipated federal funding cuts, could deepen that hole.
“This budget was really passed on a hope,” state Sen. Roger Niello, a Roseville Republican who serves as vice chair of the Senate budget committee, told reporters. “A budget that is passed on hope is a budget that is destined for trouble.”
Out of touch with Californians on spending?
And it increasingly does not reflect the will of California voters.
The Public Policy Institute of California has been surveying residents since 2003 on whether they prefer having higher taxes and a state government that provides more services or lower taxes and a state government that provides fewer services.
While Californians narrowly expressed a preference for higher taxes and more services for more than 20 years, that has recently flipped. PPIC’s latest survey released this week found that 55% of Californians now would rather have lower taxes and fewer services — although that is only true of about a third of Democrats.
The survey also found that 56% of California adults think it’s a bad idea to dip into the rainy-day fund to help balance the budget, even as an equal number support some combination of spending cuts, revenue increases and borrowing. And 58% now oppose providing health care coverage for undocumented immigrants, a complete reversal from when the question was last asked two years ago.
Mark Baldassare, director of the PPIC survey, told CalMatters the shifting political landscape tracks with an increasing number of respondents in recent years who believe the state is headed in the wrong direction and that there are bad economic times ahead.
“There’s so much pessimism about what the year ahead might look like, both in California and the nation, that there’s really a desire to shrink down the size of government and expectations that we had previously,” he said. “Voters are just not convinced that we’re not going to be in times where we can afford all the things that we want from government.”
State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, dismissed the results of one poll. He contends that most Californians, asked if they want to cut specific programs such as funding for community health clinics or kick people off their health care, would say no.
“Yes, Californians want to have government that is run well and efficiently. I want that, too,” Wiener told reporters following the budget vote. “But Californians have shown over and over again that they care deeply about making sure that we have these basic services.”
A few Democrats agreed during the floor debate today that California needed to “right-size” its spending, especially with heavy cuts to federal funding likely coming later this year.
But most defended their plan as striking the right balance between fiscal responsibility and upholding California’s values, generating intense criticism from Republicans.
“Let’s be practical. We can’t be all things to all people, but we can be responsible to the critical issues that make California a great state,” said Assemblymember Diane Dixon, a Newport Beach Republican, who cited wildfire management and home health services as priorities that the Legislature should focus on funding. “We can’t be perfect, which means we can’t do everything.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/031325_Assembly-Floor_FG_CM_22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

Legislators, cutting $3.5 billion in overall funding, endorsed a freeze on state health care for undocumented immigrants but want lower premiums and other changes In Newsom’s proposal. Democrats are divided. 



As California lawmakers grapple with a multibillion-dollar deficit and looming federal cuts that could undo the state’s health policies for immigrants, they’re banking on a tenuous budget strategy: hope.
Legislators today rejected some of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s cost-saving proposals to limit Medi-Cal for immigrants without legal status, and expanded others. And in the long run, they hope that some good financial news will help them handle the rising costs of the state health insurance and preserve future access for immigrants. 
Newsom in May proposed freezing Medi-Cal enrollment for immigrants 19 and older without permanent legal status, canceling dental care and implementing a $100 monthly copay for immigrants.
In contrast, the legislators want to expand that Medi-Cal freeze to block enrollment by more people — all non-citizens with “unsatisfactory immigration status,” which includes some legal permanent residents. But they also want some provisions designed to help immigrants: Stipulating that people already enrolled in Medi-Cal will not “age out” and awarding a six-month grace period to re-enroll if they fall off of the program because their income rises temporarily or other disqualifications.
The lawmakers also want to lower the $100 monthly premium Newsom proposed for immigrants to $30 and limit it to adults 19 through 59, and delay elimination of immigrant dental benefits for two years, until 2027. They also rejected canceling home care for immigrants.
Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, a Democrat from Santa Rosa, said earlier this week that the Legislature’s budget reverses the most “draconian” of Newsom’s cuts. 
The Legislature’s budget cuts $3.5 billion from overall state spending and borrows or delays $8.8 billion of spending during the 2025-26 budget year. During the next budget year, cuts will grow to $12 billion. 
Today’s Assembly vote was 57-19 in favor of the budget plan, including one Democrat, Joaquin Arambula of Fresno, voting against it and three Assemblymembers not casting a vote. The Senate vote was 26 to 8, with one Democrat,  María Elena Durazo, opposing it and six senators not casting a vote.
The Legislature and Newsom have two weeks, until June 27, to negotiate a final budget deal. The governor’s office didn’t immediately respond to questions about the legislators’ Medi-Cal budget.
Lawmakers from both parties, as well as health advocates, have heavily criticized both budget proposals — though for different reasons.
Health equity advocates say the budget reneges on promises lawmakers and Newsom made over the past several years to provide health care for all Californians regardless of immigration status. 
Kiran Savage-Sangwan, executive director of the group California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, said the Legislature’s budget is “deeply disappointing.” 
“While the Legislature’s proposal is not as destructive as the…Governor’s May Revision, it still buys into the flawed premise that immigrant communities are less worthy of care that keeps people healthy.”KIRIN SAVAGE-SANGWAN, CALIFORNINA PAN-ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK 
“While the Legislature’s proposal is not as destructive as the devastating reductions proposed in the Governor’s May Revision, it still buys into the flawed premise that immigrant communities are less worthy of care that keeps people healthy,” Savage-Sangwan said in a statement.
Republican lawmakers, who are largely boxed out of budget negotiations, say continuing coverage for non-citizens is fiscally irresponsible because it could come at the cost of services for citizens. Assemblymember James Gallagher, who is the leader of Assembly Republicans, said Medi-Cal is “falling apart,” with inadequate money and providers to serve patients. 
Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance for low-income Californians, covers 15 million people, including 1.6 million immigrants. It has become a flashpoint in national and state debates over rising health care costs. California last year spent $8.5 billion on immigrant health care alone, and projections indicate that it will cost more than $12 billion in the upcoming year.
Lawmakers earlier this year appropriated additional funds to Medi-Cal to stave off a $6.2 billion shortfall. Growing senior enrollment and pharmaceutical costs accounted for most of the shortfall, but about $2.7 billion came from unanticipated enrollment growth of immigrants.
While the Legislature’s proposal softens some of Newsom’s language to freeze enrollment and implement monthly premiums, it doesn’t eliminate the changes nor does it identify new revenue sources that could sustain its rapidly growing expenses. Instead, Democratic leaders have laid most of the blame for California’s deficit on President Donald Trump’s tariffs, and said they’re banking on a future economic upturn to prevent cuts. 
“We have pushed things out for two years, because hopefully there will be a miracle, and we find ourselves at a better point for revenue,” said state Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson, chair of the health budget subcommittee and a Democrat from La Mesa, during a recent press conference.
Sen. Scott Wiener, budget chair and Democrat from San Francisco, pushed back on the idea of a miracle alleviating the state’s financial woes but said the state’s revenues frequently change unexpectedly. In 2020 and 2021, California’s budget swung wildly from a brief recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to a historic surplus because of the state’s reliance on capital gains taxes. 
“We have pushed things out for two years, because hopefully there will be a miracle, and we find ourselves at a better point for revenue.”SEN. AKILAH WEBER PIERSON 
Other lawmakers say tax returns from Los Angeles County, which have been delayed until October because of the January wildfires, may also provide some relief.
“You never know. In a year, two years, three years, our revenue could be very different from what we’re projecting,” Wiener said.
Unhappy Democrats
Some Democrats are among the most vocal critics of the budget.
Many members of the Latino Caucus, which pushed for the expansion of Medi-Cal for more than a decade, say the enrollment freeze and the monthly premium create a “two-tiered” health care system that makes immigrants second-class residents.
State Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Democrat from Van Nuys, said in a statement earlier this week that McGuire removed her from the budget health subcommittee because of her opposition to cuts for immigrants. McGuire’s office did not respond to questions about why she was removed.
On the floor today, Menjivar, who abstained from voting on the budget, said her vote wasn’t needed for the budget to pass, but her constituents needed to know she fought for them. 
“Your community is my community and we’re suffering right now and hurting. I need to be able to stand firm and tall for my constituents and say this is why I dissented,” Menjivar said.
Senate Majority Leader and Latino Caucus Chair Lena Gonzalez, from Long Beach, urged Newsom and other lawmakers to protect “health care for all.”
Other Democrats defended their choices.
“We are keeping the promises that we made,” Weber Pierson said on the Senate floor. “No one will be disenrolled from Medi-Cal. That means no one currently covered will automatically lose their health care coverage.”
Unhappy Republicans
In a rare showing of bipartisanship, a handful of Republicans opposed another Newsom proposal, which would reduce in-home supportive services that many seniors and people with disabilities rely on. But they criticize the choice to continue offering health care for immigrants, especially with a large deficit.
Newsom is “trying to prop up this faulty system, and a big part of it was expanding it to illegal immigrants. It’s not fiscally feasible. It’s ballooning the budget out of control,” Gallagher said.
Gov. Newsom is “trying to prop up this faulty system, and a big part of it was expanding it to illegal immigrants. It’s not fiscally feasible. It’s ballooning the budget out of control.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER JAMES GALLAGHER
State Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican from Roseville and ranking minority member on the budget committee, said the Democrats’ proposal relies on budget gimmicks, such as delayed spending or fund shifts, and fails to address the structural deficit caused by growing Medi-Cal costs. 
Niello pointed out that the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office projects steep deficits for the next three budget years. 
“Hoping against hope, that’s not a good budget strategy,” Niello said. “What you should do is hope for better, but prepare for the worst, and we’re not preparing for the worst. We’re not even preparing for the negative, reasonable expectation that we’re looking at over the next three or four budget years.”
Unhappy health advocates
In past years, the Medi-Cal expansion to immigrants has been popular with some Central Valley Republicans supporting it. But recent polls indicate Californians have mixed feelings about providing Medi-Cal to people who are not citizens. 
In a new poll commissioned by the California Endowment, 56% of likely voters supported allowing all low-income Californians regardless of immigration status to use Medi-Cal. But a Public Policy Institute of California poll published Thursday shows nearly the opposite, with 58% of adults opposing health care for immigrants without legal status. That’s in contrast to 2023 and 2021 polls from the institute showing clear majorities of Californians supported health care for immigrants.
Still, health advocates who have pushed for the expansion said the Legislature is callously sacrificing the health care of immigrants.
Amanda McAllister-Wallner, executive director of Health Access California, said lawmakers have not proposed any real solutions to keep health access for immigrants intact. Instead, they accepted Newsom’s framework to scale it back, she said. 
That is especially troubling, she said, because deep federal funding cuts likely to be approved before the end of the year will cause California even more financial pain. One cut approved by House Republicans last month in the federal budget bill punishes states that give health care to immigrants by reducing their federal reimbursements.
“If they’re not willing to fight now, I’m worried about that,” McAllister-Wallner said.

Mark Mullet, when he was running for governor. He’s now running to be mayor of Issaquah after retiring from the Legislature. (Photo courtesy of Mark Mullet gubernatorial campaign)Former Washington state lawmaker Mark Mullet didn’t break any laws when he accepted contributions to his campaign for Issaquah mayor in December, a judge ruled Friday.
Issaquah Municipal Court Judge Scott Stewart dismissed a complaint against Mullet, saying the city ordinance he was accused of violating, which restricted when candidates could receive donations, is unconstitutional.
Stewart ruled from the bench following a hearing that lasted a little over five minutes. He later issued a one-page order stating the city’s limitation violates the First Amendment right to donate to political campaigns.
“This unconstitutional law was left on the books too long. As mayor, I look forward to fixing inconsistencies in our laws like this one,” Mullet said afterwards.
The city pretty much conceded last month, informing the judge that it would defer to his decision.
Mullet, a Democrat and ex-state senator who ran unsuccessfully for governor last year, launched his mayoral campaign in December. That month, he raised $4,478.34.
A complaint filed in February accused him of violating an Issaquah law that says candidates can only fundraise in the same calendar year as the election for the office they seek. Therefore, he needed to wait until Jan. 1 because the mayoral race is on the November ballot.
Had the judge upheld the law, Mullet could have been ordered to surrender his December haul to the city as a penalty.
The Issaquah City Council passed that ordinance in May 2009, and it took effect on June 1 of that year. It also imposed a $500 cap on donations that is not affected by Friday’s ruling.
That same year, Mullet won a seat on the city council. He has said he recalled the debate on the city law focused on the contribution limit, not the timing for accepting donations. Mullet served on the council until 2013 when he entered the Legislature.
Mullet never disputed the facts. He questioned the legality of the ordinance and noted no other city in the state had such a rule restricting when contributions could be collected. 
In a May 19 letter to the court, Issaquah Prosecuting Attorney Alexa McBarron attached a February ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas, which said the city of Austin’s ban on fundraising outside a one-year period is unconstitutional.
Mullet and City Councilwoman Lindsey Walsh are competing to be Issaquah’s next mayor. 
In March, Walsh took a swipe at her opponent, saying she knew the rules and that it was important “that if somebody is going to lead the city, they respect and follow the laws.”
She declined to comment on Friday’s outcome.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mullet-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Several Arkansas cities are slated to be the scene of organized “No Kings” demonstrations Saturday, as part of a national protest against President Donald Trump’s policies and actions during his second term.
A map on the No Kings website shows 15 demonstrations are planned in Arkansas. In addition to Little Rock and Fayetteville, other demonstrations are planned for Bentonville, Fort Smith, Texarkana, Monticello, Jonesboro, Paragould, West Memphis, Hot Springs, Benton/Bryant, Russellville, Eureka Springs, Harrison and Mountain Home.
The demonstrations coincide with Flag Day, the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army and Trump’s 79th birthday. A large-scale military parade, costing as much as $45 million is planned for Washington, D.C. Although the Army’s anniversary celebration isn’t officially tied to Trump’s birthday, the president has had such an event on his wish list since his first term. 
“June 14, Flag Day, is when President Donald Trump is holding a military parade in the nation’s capital, wasting tens of millions of taxpayer dollars as a birthday gift to himself while his administration defies checks on his power, undermines our civil rights and tries to strip away essential benefits from veterans, seniors, hungry children and others,” the organizers of the No Kings protest in Fayetteville, Indivisible NWA, wrote in a press release.
The planned protests come as tensions in Los Angeles have flared in recent days due to arrests of immigrants the Trump administration says are in the country. The arrests led to large protests occasionally marred by violence. In response to the protests, Trump federalized the California National Guard over the objections of California Gov. Gavin Newsom in order to push back what he described as a “Migrant Invasion,” and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth promptly ordered them into Los Angeles in the name of protecting federal law enforcement.
A federal court Thursday issued a temporary restraining order returning the National Guard to state control, calling the Trump administration’s actions “illegal.” An appeals court temporarily stayed the ruling soon after.
Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders chimed in on the L.A. protests while in the nation’s capital earlier this week, saying that unlike Newsom, she would call the Trump administration for assistance if protests similar to the ones in California broke out in Arkansas. 
When contacted for comment on whether state resources would be utilized in response to protests this weekend, a spokesperson for Sanders directed the Advocate to the Arkansas National Guard.
“The Arkansas National Guard always stands ready to support the needs of the state, when directed by the Governor. At this time, we’ve received no request for military support,” Arkansas National Guard spokesperson Bob Oldham said in an email.
Jan Amann, one of Indivisible NWA’s co-leaders, said the emphasis is and always will be having a peaceful, nonviolent protest. She added that there will be marchers in the crowd who have been trained in deescalation techniques.
Indivisible NWA is trying to get attention, Amann said. The group has been protesting weekly in front of U.S. Rep. Steve Womack’s office and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton’s office in Rogers in attempts to have conversations with them, but their requests for a conversation or a townhall have not been acknowledged, she said.
Amann said she felt confident they were well-prepared for Saturday’s demonstrations. While anything can happen, especially when it comes to “kneejerk” reactions from individuals, the advantage to having a protest in Fayetteville is how experienced local law enforcement is with handling large crowds with opposing viewpoints, thanks to the presence of the Arkansas Razorbacks and Razorback Stadium.
“They know what to watch for,” Amann said. “Some people come [to protests] wanting to agitate. … When you’re getting a bunch of people with differing points of view, we need to expect that there might be something, but the whole key is preparation.”
Gracie Ziegler, a spokesperson for the city of Fayetteville, echoed Amann in saying the city was well prepared. She said preparations have been thorough, and that the protest organizers have been very communicative. She said the city did not anticipate major issues.
“The police department is aware of the plans, and they’ll be present to make sure everybody stays safe and peaceful, which is the goal of the organizers. They’ve all been in really good communication,” Ziegler said.
Amann said that while the NWA protest would be “rain or shine,” they were keeping an eye on the weather. If more severe weather affects the protest, it likely won’t go forward since their protest permit is for a specific period of time.
Other protests will happen in Little Rock, where organizers wrote online that demonstrators will cross the Broadway Street Bridge to North Little Rock. The Advocate was not able to get in touch with protest organizers in Little Rock.
Little Rock Police Department spokesperson Mark Edwards said the department has “a plan in place” for the protests, confirming that additional officers would be on-hand. He would not confirm whether the department would shut down the bridge, saying it was “premature to say what we’ll do. A lot of it will be dictated by the scene and the circumstances.”
“The goal is always for people to be able to — on both sides — to be able to protest in peace, and you want everybody to be safe,” Edwards said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250405_Fayetteville-Rally-6-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247
,DC,2025-06-13 20:23:56+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Radiation exposure fund backed by Missouri’s Hawley included in U.S. Senate mega-bill,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/radiation-exposure-fund-backed-missouris-hawley-included-us-senate-mega-bill,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri praised the addition of radiation exposure compensation funds in the Senate version of the costly “one big beautiful” budget reconciliation bill that extends and expands tax cuts and reduces funding from social safety net programs.Hawley, a Republican, said Friday the proposed revival and expansion of the fund for Americans in Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Wyoming and the Navajo Nation marks a “tremendous day for the people of Missouri and for nuclear radiation survivors across the country.”“This is a chance, finally, to make it right,” Hawley said on a call with reporters.“All of this is caused by the federal government's negligence in its testing program and its disposal program, where repeatedly the government, over the years, exposed citizens unwillingly and unwittingly to nuclear radiation,” Hawley said.Lawmakers on the Republican-led Senate Committee on the Judiciary included the bipartisan legislation in the panel’s text for the massive budget reconciliation bill, which the panel released Thursday. Hawley is a member of the committee.The complex budget process combines legislation from 10 Senate committees and only requires a simple majority to get through the chamber.If approved by the Senate, lawmakers in both chambers would then need to reconcile their separate versions. The House version does not include a reauthorization of the radiation exposure fund.Radiation exposure fundThe Radiation Exposure Compensation Fund, often called RECA, was established in 1990 and pays one-time sums to those who developed certain diseases after working on U.S. nuclear tests and to those who lived in counties downwind from test explosion sites in Arizona, Nevada and Utah.Uranium industry workers who were employed in 11 states who subsequently developed qualifying diseases also qualify.The U.S. conducted more than 1,000 atomic weapons tests from 1945 to 1992 — the first at the Trinity Test site near Alamogordo, New Mexico, where the U.S. tested the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project prior to dropping the weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, at the end of World War II.The Department of Justice administered the fund before it ended in June 2024, and by June 2022 had approved $2.3 billion in benefits.The Senate overwhelmingly passed the bipartisan bill in March 2024 but it died in the House.If the lawmakers approve the legislation as part of the budget reconciliation package, the fund would reach areas including in Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, where communities were impacted by radioactive waste dumping, uranium processing and other activities surrounding the testing.The bill would also expand downwind areas to include Colorado, Idaho, Montana and New Mexico and increase the one-time compensation sums to victims or surviving family members up to $100,000.Dawn Chapman, a Missouri advocate for radioactive waste cleanup and co-founder of Just Moms STL, told reporters on the Friday morning call that generations in the St. Louis area have suffered “extreme amounts of devastation in the form of illnesses.”“If you take a hard look at our bipartisan RECA family as we call ourselves, you'll see that we are made up of so many different backgrounds, so many different communities, so many different faiths,” she said.“And we understand politically right now that there's a lot going on with this big package. We're just hopeful that this is the one thing in this bill that everybody will agree is a great thing, and not touch and leave it in there and let us have our justice and peace.”Negotiations ongoingRepublicans have wrangled with limiting the price tag of the mega-bill as they aim to carry out President Donald Trump’s campaign promises of extending and expanding tax cuts, which cost roughly $3.9 trillion according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.To offset the massive costs, the House-passed version cuts social safety net programs and clean energy incentives.By changing eligibility requirements and what Medicaid can cover, the House bill would reduce federal spending on health provisions, including the government health insurance program for low-income individuals, by roughly $902 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.It would also tighten eligibility and shift to states costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP, resulting in a $285.7 billion reduction in federal spending, according to CBO.The bill would also eliminate $249 billion in clean energy investment and production tax credits over the next decade.With Senate negotiations in full swing, CBO released an analysis last week revealing the overall bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years.A separate CBO analysis also found the House version would tilt in the favor of higher earners and overall decrease resources for low-income Americans.Hawley, who vows he won’t support cuts to Medicaid in the Senate version, said Friday he’ll continue that stance, even with the added price tag of the RECA fund.“Not cutting Medicaid benefits is hugely, hugely important for me, (and) making sure rural hospitals don't close. Half of the hospitals in Missouri are rural. I don't want to see any of those closed, so I am in hourly contact with leadership in negotiations on this,” he said.Hawley is also pushing to significantly increase the child tax credit to $5,000, up from the temporary $2,500 in the House version. He did not comment directly on the call when a reporter asked whether the increased child tax credit remained a priority for him in the mega-bill.",,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

(George Frey | Getty Images)A legal challenge of West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order allowing religious exemptions to the state’s school vaccine requirements will proceed, despite the state school board voting this week to defy the order.
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice filed the writ of mandamus last month in Kanawha County Circuit Court on behalf of two parents of immunocompromised children. The lawsuit asks the court to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop granting religious exemptions in compliance with Morrisey’s executive order. 
“The lawsuit is still ongoing,” Aubrey Sparks, legal director for ACLU-WV, said Friday. “I think that there are a lot of questions about what [the board of education’s decision] means practically, whether this fixes the issue, or whether it doesn’t. At this point, it’s just too early for us to know the consequences of the school board’s actions, given that Patrick Morrisey is still committed to awarding these exemptions.”
The state school board unanimously voted Wednesday that Superintendent Michele Blatt would issue guidance to county boards of education that schools should follow the state’s existing vaccine mandates, which allow only medical exemptions, rather than the executive order. 
“The intent of the state board is to do what’s best for the 241,000 children, 23,000 educators and 15,000 service personnel in our 629 public schools,” the board wrote in a statement Thursday afternoon. “This includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws.
“The board is constitutionally bound to provide a thorough and efficient system of free schools, and our members remain committed to this charge,” they wrote. 
Sparks said the board’s action introduces a lot of uncertainty both to families who want religious exemptions and families of immunocompromised children who might be at risk if exemptions are granted.
West Virginia’s school vaccine laws are some of the strongest in the country. It’s one of five states that by law allow only medical exemptions for school-required vaccines. Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state to allow religious exemptions.
Despite the order, the Legislature this year rejected Senate Bill 460, which would have made the religious exemptions part of state law. 
Since Morrisey issued the executive order in January, the state Department of Health has granted at least 330 religious exemptions to the vaccine requirements. 
A spokeswoman for the school board said Friday that the exemptions that have already been granted will not be accepted for the upcoming new school year because, per the governor’s instructions, the exemptions must be renewed yearly. 
Alisa Shepler, a school nurse in Wood County, said the state school board’s move is a victory for school nurses and for West Virginia health care more generally. Immunizations protect more than only school children, they also protect immunocompromised people in the community, she said.
Shepler, who is retiring Friday after more than 25 years on the job, said she’s proud of the school board for going against the governor’s order. 
“I think that it’s very telling that our state board of education, they kind of drew a line in the sand,” she said. “And a lot of times, I think states don’t have that backbone, but obviously our state board of education did.”
In a statement Wednesday, a spokesman for the governor’s office said that the state school board is “trampling on the religious liberties of children, ignoring the state’s religious freedom law, and trying to make the state an extreme outlier on vaccine policy when there isn’t a valid public policy reason to do so.”
The governor’s executive order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act, a law signed by former Gov. Jim Justice in 2023 that prohibits government action that substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion unless it serves a compelling government interest and is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest.
Sparks said the religious freedom law gives people a process by which to say their rights have been violated, but it does not give the governor the right to ignore, override a duty created by the legislature. 
“What really is underlying this is an attempt at executive power over reach,” Sparks said. “Patrick Morrisey wanted a law passed. He lobbied to get a law passed, and he wasn’t successful at it. He didn’t pull it across the finish line because the Legislature didn’t agree with them. And it’s not a governor’s right or ability to ignore the laws that the Legislature passes just because they don’t like them.”

First quarter exports are down 6% compared to the first quarter of 2024 — and the quarter ended before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, which raised the effective tax on imports to 27%, before courts intervened and Trump reversed or paused some of the taxes. 
Minnesota exports have been hit harder than the country as a whole; nationally, exports were up 3% compared to this time last year.

Trump’s tariffs have prompted retaliation from two of Minnesota’s biggest trade partners: Canada and China, which imposed taxes on goods purchased from the U.S. 
Mexico, Minnesota’s second-biggest trade partner, has largely avoided major tariffs and has not retaliated with new import taxes of its own.
Exports from Minnesota to Mexico, however, have dropped 16%, as the country buys fewer Minnesota-produced vehicles, machines, food byproducts, cereals and iron. Exports to Canada, the state’s biggest buyer, are down 3%.
“On-again, off-again tariffs issued unilaterally by the Trump Administration continue to cause significant uncertainty and concern for Minnesota companies in planning their business strategies, including importing and exporting,” DEED Commissioner Matt Varilek said in a press release.
The effects of tariffs and economic uncertainty are distributed unevenly across states and industries; in nearby Wisconsin, exports have increased 2% compared to the first quarter of 2024. North Dakota’s exports are up 5%, while South Dakota’s are down 11%.

U.S. District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz had ruled Wednesday that federal authorities lacked grounds to hold Khalil, a permanent resident who’s been detained since March for helping to organize pro-Palestinian protests. His detention was likely unconstitutional, the judge decreed, ordering authorities to free him or ask the 3d Circuit Court of Appeals by Friday morning to step in.
But in a letter to the court Friday, government attorneys argued they were no longer detaining Khalil based on the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and instead held him based on a separate federal statute that allows authorities to keep immigrants in custody during removal proceedings.
“Detaining Khalil based on that other ground of removal is lawful,” the attorneys wrote. “An alien like Khalil may be detained during the pendency of removal proceedings regardless of the charge of removability.”
Secretary of State Marco Rubio in April released a memo justifying Khalil’s deportation that argued his support of pro-Palestinian protests would have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”
Farbiarz on Wednesday had noted the government could argue Khalil, who has no criminal convictions or charges, could be detained because some information on his lawful permanent resident application was allegedly inaccurate. But he’d cautioned that argument would be ineffective here because green card holders are virtually never detained for that reason.
“That strongly suggests that it is the Secretary of State’s determination that drives the Petitioner’s ongoing detention — not the other charge against him,” the judge wrote Wednesday.
Attorney Ian Fernando Hinonangan, who represents Khalil, echoed the judge’s own words and said federal authorities’ reasoning for his continued detention was part of a campaign of retaliation for Khalil’s First Amendment-protected speech.
While the judge’s order allowed officials to continue efforts to remove Khalil that were not based on Rubio’s memo, it did not explicitly permit them to continue detaining him for other reasons, Hinonangan wrote in a Friday declaration.
“The post-hoc charge is an undisputed continuation in the fabric of retaliatory motive and hence ‘carries the taint of unconstitutional conduct,’” Hinonangan said.

Pictured is a 2023 protest over abortion rights at the same location. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderFive years ago, an Atlanta protest that began peacefully ended in chaos with burning police cars and tear gas canisters.
With mass protests over the Trump administration’s policies set to take place around the country Saturday, Georgia’s leaders say they will be prepared if violent elements overtake peaceful protests. Around two dozen protests are scheduled across Georgia with hundreds across the country.
But organizers of the planned “No Kings” event in Atlanta say they’ve taken every step to ensure a morning of peaceful demonstration.
“This is a permitted rally,” said Laura Judge, an activist with the Indivisible Georgia Coalition, one of the main organizers of the Atlanta event. “We went and we talked with local officials and law enforcement to make sure that this is a safe and permitted, peaceful rally. But, you know, we went above and beyond to ensure that there is safety and de-escalation.”
Judge said that means over 100 volunteers, including 28 medics and 37 marshals trained in de-escalation, conflict prevention and crowd safety techniques. Medics will be specifically trained to assist older attendees and with disabilities, and the staff will include a law enforcement liaison to assist with communicating with police.
Georgia’s top leaders have warned against violent escalations. Gov. Brian Kemp vowed “heavy accountability,” and Attorney General Chris Carr issued a statement threatening to charge offenders with domestic terrorism, which comes with a prison sentence of up to 35 years.
“Our attorney general just put a statement out about how protests should look,” Judge said. “And while we’re committed and we want all our attendees to be peaceful and use their First Amendment rights, we don’t want anyone having that threat of being arrested or being detained when we have done everything, we have checked all the boxes to do what is right using our First Amendment.”
Organizers of Columbus’ event recommended an unusual response in case of unexpected behavior.
“In the rare event that individuals outside our organization come to the event and behave in ways that are contrary to our peaceful values, we strongly encourage attendees to sit, hold hands, and listen to to instructions from our trained de-escalators,” reads a post from Indivisible Columbus on social media. “We are 100% committed to and united in peace.”
Speaking at a virtual meeting for nationwide participants Thursday, Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin called for spirited but peaceful protests, saying that violence would play into the hands of their political opponents.
“When some bad actors engage in property destruction or violence, the Trump team says, ‘see, there, now we need to escalate further,’” he said. “And that’s Trump’s plan, rinse and repeat. It’s straight from the authoritarian playbook.”
Britt Jacovich, deputy communications director at the liberal MoveOn advocacy group, echoed Levin’s sentiments.
“Trump wants chaos on camera, and so we shouldn’t give him any footage to use,” she said. “We win by showing the truth. We are joyful, proud, nonviolent, in every corner of the country.”
Judge said problems caused by outside agitators are always a concern for protesters, but volunteers have been trained to deal with potential criminal elements.
“I believe it’s important that at least the organizers and the volunteers are all on the same page knowing who we go to and who we need to work with when things are escalating like that so that we’re not branded as these agitators,” she said. “Because that is not the purpose, our purpose is to show the power belongs to the people and we’re allowed to speak up and we should not just automatically be branded as agitators or instigators.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/abortion-protest-capitol.jpg,,,2025-06-13 17:02:36.417247

(Photo by Cecilia Lynch/USDA)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Friday released its renewable fuel standards draft rule which, if finalized, would set record high levels of biofuels to be blended into U.S. transportation fuels. 
Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said the draft rule, which proposes a total 24.02 billion gallon blending level in 2026, is a “very strong starting point for further discussions.” 
Shaw said the association will need time to evaluate the proposal, specifically as it relates to changes in credits for imported fuels and feedstocks. 
According to the proposal, EPA is considering “several regulatory changes” to the RFS program that would reduce the number of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs which is the measuring unit for renewable fuel, for imported renewable fuels and renewable fuels produced from imported feedstocks.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports imported biodiesel feedstocks, like used cooking oil, tallow and canola oil have all increased over the past several years due to the high cost of domestic feedstocks. According to the same report, in the 2023 and 2024 marketing year, the U.S. consumed nearly 30% of biofuel feedstocks exported globally.
The news to prioritize domestic feedstocks was welcomed by Iowa Soybean Association President Brent Swart, who said biomass-based diesel supports “roughly 10% of the price per bushel of soybeans.” 
“Biomass-based diesel has long provided significant value to soybean farmers, helping us weather difficult economic times and supporting our state’s thriving agriculture industry,” Swart said in a statement.
The EPA program sets overall standards and specific standards for different types of biofuels. The draft rules propose biomass-based diesel standards equivalent to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons in 2027. 
These figures are a significant jump from 2025 targets from EPA, which set an annual volume requirement of 3.35 billion gallons for biomass-based diesel.
“This is a significant step toward putting the market back on track,” Swart said. “It is also a long overdue recognition that Iowa farmers, soybean processors and the state’s biodiesel producers, can contribute even more (to) America’s energy output.” 
Swart said the announcement “provides added certainty” for soybean farmers during the growing season and he thanked the Trump administration for supporting “farmers’ critical role” in U.S. energy policy. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said USDA and EPA have “never been more aligned” on the demand for domestically grown biofuels. 
“This is the highest ever Renewable Volume Obligation and it sends a strong signal to the U.S. biofuels industry that President Trump has their backs and gives them the incentive to invest in American products for American consumers and to export around the world,” Rollins said in a statement. 


Biofuels in Iowa: 
Iowa is the leading producer of biofuels in the nation. According to Iowa Soybean Association, the soybean oil used to produce biodiesel in Iowa in 2024 was equivalent to more than 30% of the soybeans grown in the state. 
An IRFA report found that in 2024, the state produced 4.61 billion gallons of fuel ethanol, and the industry provided a market for nearly 60% of Iowa’s 2024 corn crop. 
The same study, however, showed a decline in economic impact from the biofuels industry, and IRFA said entry to the ultra-low carbon fuel market would be the “most cost-effective and impactful” way to revitalize biofuels and corn markets. 


The EPA proposal additionally waives the 2025 cellulosic biofuel volume requirement and reinstates the values through 2026 and 2027, due to a shortfall in the production of the fuels made from nonfood-based renewable feedstocks, like cellulose or lignin.
The draft rule also removes renewable electricity as a qualifying renewable fuel under the program, which follows a move from the Trump administration to block state-specific mandates on emissions that encouraged the use of electric vehicles. 
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst celebrated the move and the EPA announcement in a statement, saying it brings RFS “back on track.” 
“By eliminating the electric vehicle mandate and restoring the RFS’ original focus on liquid transportation fuels, prioritizing domestically grown crops over foreign imports, setting record-high volumes to revitalize the biofuel industry, and adopting safeguards to prevent small refinery waivers from gutting the program—it is clear the Trump administration is committed to championing rural America,” Ernst said. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig similarly applauded the move, including the proposed regulation changes to steer producers away from foreign-made feedstocks. 
“President Trump is once again demonstrating his commitment to showcasing how Iowa-made biofuels can be central to his effort to make America energy dominant,” Naig said in a statement. “Biofuels are a win for drivers and American farmers – they save drivers money at the pump, directly support corn and soybean prices, expand markets for farmers, and support rural jobs and communities.” 
EPA will host a public hearing on the rules July 8. 
Shaw said IRFA plans to work with EPA through the commenting period and to secure a final rule from the agency. 
“Agriculture is hurting, having just endured the largest two-year drop in net farm income in history,” Shaw said. “We need forward leaning RFS blending levels to maximize American energy dominance.”

(Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A three-judge appeals court panel on Friday cleared the way for Kansans to resume changing their gender markers on driver’s licenses, rejecting arguments made by Attorney General Kris Kobach and overturning a lower court ruling.
The Kansas Court of Appeals panel ordered the case return to the district court level to be heard by someone other than Shawnee County District Judge Teresa Watson, who abused her discretion and committed legal and factual errors, according to the Friday ruling.
Judges Karen Arnold-Burger, Stephen Hill and Sarah Warner determined the state would suffer no harm by allowing transgender residents to be identified by their “gender,” which is a personal identity or expression, rather than their “sex,” which relates to reproductive systems. Kobach’s office had argued that the two terms are interchangeable.
The Legislature passed a law in 2023 that requires vital statistics to recognize a person’s biological sex at birth. Kobach sued the Kansas Department of Revenue for continuing to allow transgender residents to change the gender markers on their driver’s license, as the office had done since at least 2007.
From 2011 to 2022, KDOR issued 9,316,937 driver’s licenses. During that period, 380 drivers changed their gender marker.
Watson in 2023 issued a temporary injunction to block changes in gender markers on driver’s licenses. The appeals court, which heard arguments in January, removed that injunction and replaced it with an order to allow changes.
Watson, the higher court said, had committed a legal error by concluding, without any support, that Kobach’s mere allegation that KDOR was violating state law had established irreparable harm. Additionally, the higher court faulted Watson’s conclusion that changing a gender marker could hinder law enforcement officers.
“The problem with the district court’s finding is that the AG presented no evidence to support this claimed injury beyond unsubstantiated speculation,” Arnold-Burger wrote on behalf of the appeals court panel.
In fact, she wrote, “the evidence was overwhelming that there was no harm.”
At the district court level, Shawnee County Sheriff Brian Hill testified that one time, he didn’t say when, he arrested a transgender woman who told him that she was a man. One of the problems with that example, Arnold-Burger wrote, is that he relied on the individual’s “outward appearance,” not their driver’s license. And, she wrote, the same mistake could be made for any cisgender woman who appears less feminine and more masculine than the average woman.
Additionally, the sheriff’s gender confusion didn’t prevent the arrest or immediate discovery of the person’s identity. And, Hill acknowledged that law enforcement officers can’t always rely on a driver’s license anyway because people change their names.
“The district court committed an error of fact by concluding that there was evidence — any evidence beyond mere speculation — to support a finding that law enforcement would be immediately hindered in the identification of suspects, victims, wanted persons, missing persons, detainees, and others if the driver’s license did not display the driver’s sex assigned at birth,” Arnold-Burger wrote.
The appeals court ruling also noted that the Kansas Supreme Court has recognized a distinction between “sex” and “gender” since at least 2002. And it determined that Kobach was unlikely to prevail in the case.
The appeals court panel ordered the case return to the district court level for a hearing before a new judge.
“Because of the district court’s abuse of discretion, the KDOR has been unable to issue reclassifications of gender designations on Kansas driver’s licenses for two years while this litigation languished,” Arnold-Burger wrote.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/4F5A8392-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-13 15:57:13.782636

CHICAGO — Transit agency officials in Chicagoland met this week and formally began the process of planning for next year’s budget, including drawing up plans for major service cuts and potential layoffs.

It’s the latest chapter in an ongoing fight between public transit officials and state lawmakers over funding. Public transportation agencies’ federal COVID-19 relief funds are set to run out in 2026. Despite the funding, ridership on buses and trains still hasn’t reached prepandemic levels.

Now, transit agencies running buses and trains in northern Illinois are facing a $771 million annual combined budget gap — and lawmakers did not pass funding reform legislation by a critical May 31 deadline.

While House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch told Capitol News Illinois last week that lawmakers “have time” to handle the situation, transit officials told a very different story at two meetings this week.

“We have told everyone they needed to act by May 31st or else,” Regional Transportation Authority board member Tom Kotarac said at a board meeting Thursday. “We are in the ‘or else’ phase.”

Officials at the RTA laid out a plan Thursday to handle the monetary uncertainty: create two budgets. In one scenario, budget planners assume the gap is filled, and agencies can move forward with the rough plan approved late last year.

“But we cannot operate on assumptions and pledges of good faith and promises. We just can’t, legally,” RTA government affairs director Rob Nash said.

The RTA board formally asked the agencies it oversees — the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra commuter rail and Pace Suburban Bus — to prepare a budget that assumes no new funding from Springfield before the end of the year. This means a roughly 20% reduction from what the agency expected.

Multiple RTA officials called it the “doomsday” scenario. RTA Chief Financial Officer Kevin Bueso said it would require “catastrophic” cuts. CTA acting President Nora Leerhsen told the CTA board on Wednesday that it was “severe and sobering for all of us and hard to stomach.”

Under both plans, the RTA would institute fare increases in 2026 and administrative “efficiencies” to reduce costs in 2025. The RTA also plans to create an ad hoc task force to plan cuts and manage the year’s unusual budget process.

The austerity measures are not just a piece of political theater. The RTA, under state law, must tell service boards the amount of revenue that will be available to them by Sept. 15 each year and the boards must submit individual budgets based on that revenue. The oversight agency releases preliminary funding amounts for transit planners to use months earlier in July.

Leerhsen said the CTA will continue to operate with its current 2025 service plan, but that over the summer and into the fall, the agency will hold public hearings to “more specifically consider” the consequences of the fiscal cliff.

The September deadline is three weeks before the General Assembly's fall session begins — the earliest that lawmakers are scheduled to meet.

But even if lawmakers meet in October and pass funding reform, officials said that missing their spring deadline has already guaranteed harmful effects.

“I don't want to give anyone false hope that there is still any way to avoid some of these negative impacts,” RTA Executive Director Leanne Redden said. “The negative impacts are here, and now we're going to have to all work together to mitigate the worst of those impacts for as long as possible while the legislature continues to do their work.”

Even if lawmakers pass a new funding mechanism, because of the time it takes to implement new policies, that money might not become available to transit agencies until next summer, either due to far off effective dates on any new laws or the delays of implementing new policies.

Delays in funding would, according to Nash, impose “costs, financial and otherwise, to the system and to riders.”

“We are likely to face a challenge in the first part of 2026 no matter what the General Assembly does at this point,” Nash said during the Thursday RTA board meeting.

What’s next in Springfield

Over the past year, several proposals have been pitched in Springfield to address problems in Chicagoland transit agencies.

Two major proposals came from a coalition of environmentalists and labor unions. On Thursday, representatives of the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and Labor Alliance for Public Transportation, two groups that have occasionally disagreed on how to address transit agencies’ woes, released a joint statement.

The groups said the RTA’s Thursday meeting “unveiled the disastrous consequences of Springfield’s inaction” and called for lawmakers to meet this summer to address the problem.

“We cannot wait any longer — the General Assembly needs to avert further disaster and address the transit fiscal cliff with reforms and dedicated revenue, while working with existing agencies to ensure that we are investing in the future of our transit systems. The time to act is now,” the groups said.

While no proposal received close to the support it needed this spring, one bill made it through the Senate in the final hours of lawmakers’ legislative session.

That bill would have instituted several reforms that had been broadly agreed on, although not unanimous. Certain provisions laying out the balance of power on various boards were opposed by local governments.

Its funding mechanism, however, ignited quick controversy. The provision that sparked the greatest opposition would have instituted a $1.50 tax on package deliveries except on orders of groceries and medicine.



[caption id=""attachment_70909"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1140""] The board of the Chicago Transit Authority meets June 12 at the agency’s downtown Chicago headquarters. (Capitol News Illinois photo by Andrew Adams)[/caption]



That provision drew near-immediate opposition from businesses and interest groups with influential networks of lobbyists. The major tech lobbying group TechNet, along with Uber, Instacart, DoorDash, Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce and several retail industry groups, registered their opposition.

That bill was not considered in the House, and no bill with a similar funding mechanism was proposed in that chamber.

Paula Worthington, an economist and senior lecturer at the University of Chicago, told Capitol News Illinois that imposing a new tax like the delivery fee would be difficult.

“That is a heavy lift, procedurally, legally,” Worthington said. “You can’t just wave a magic wand.”

Worthington pointed to other states’ systems of transit funding that typically include “some elements of shared burden.” Other states have implemented a “commuter transportation mobility” tax on certain businesses, taxes on road users, or expanding taxes on ride sharing companies. Worthington said Illinois could consider those or other taxes during discussions over the summer to identify a solution.

“But those discussions now need to be out in the public,” Worthington said.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is urging insurers to continue covering vaccinations during pregnancy in an open letter signed by 30 prominent professional health organizations.
Pregnant patients and their infants are vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. In the letter to payers and insurance companies released this week, ACOG stressed the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations and how they protect babies and pregnant people. It was signed by prominent professional groups including the American College of Physicians, Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Public Health Association.
The letter follows U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy children and healthy pregnant patients, sidestepping an established decision process by scientists. Kennedy, who has made false claims questioning vaccine safety, earlier this week fired all 17 experts on the federal vaccine advisory committee panel, replacing them with eight new members, four of whom have spoken out against vaccines.
The Trump administration’s moves have alarmed health experts, who worry about coverage and access to the shot amid the agency’s dismissal of science.

“We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” the letter reads. “Given the historic gaps in research, investment, and support for women’s health, it is essential that all aspects of obstetric and gynecologic care — including COVID-19 vaccination — be grounded in the best available scientific evidence.
Studies have shown babies born following a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have a higher risk of low birth weights, stillbirth and respiratory distress, and data demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.

Pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are also at higher risk of complications such as blood clots, are more likely to be hospitalized in intensive care units or to need ventilators, and are at a higher risk of death, the letter notes.
Payers should make the vaccine available to “pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” the letter reads. Without insurance, a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 shot can cost roughly $140 for adults.
Following the recommendation rollback, public health officials in some states have emphasized their support of COVID-19 vaccines.

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, for example, said it “continues to recommend the current COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older,” noting that newborns “depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection.” Wisconsin Medicaid will also continue to cover the shot, the department said in a media release.
Officials in Georgia also said they expect continued coverage of the shot.
In Washington, a spokesperson for the state health agency told local media that the department is advising pregnant people to speak with their provider “to determine if receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is best for them.”
During this year’s legislative sessions, at least seven states introduced legislation aiming to ban or limit mRNA vaccines. Instead of using a weakened or dead version of the actual virus to stimulate an immune response, mRNA vaccines use a genetic code created in a laboratory to tell the body’s cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology.
“The COVID vaccines were a remarkable scientific accomplishment, and they remain the best tool that we have to prevent severe outcomes associated with COVID infection,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, ACOG president, wrote in a statement. “Ob-gyns know that COVID infection during pregnancy can be incredibly dangerous for our pregnant patients — and we know that the vaccine can protect both them and their infants after birth.”
When patients are “forced to pay out of pocket, or to cover high cost sharing,” he wrote, “they are less likely to be able to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”

NMDOH urged anyone who was possibly exposed to check vaccination status and to stay home if symptoms such as a rash or fever develop. Further questions about testing, vaccinations and potential treatment can be directed to the NMDOH Hotline at 1-833-796-8773.
Measles symptoms do not develop immediately, often between one to three weeks from exposure. People are infectious several days before and after symptoms such as headache, cough, runny nose, red eyes, fever, and spotty red rash appear.
Additional information, such as vaccine clinic hours, is available on NMDOH’s measles webpage.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-06-13 19:34:28+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,New Jersey issues new guidance on national opioid settlement spending,Dana DiFilippo,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/06/13/new-jersey-issues-new-guidance-on-national-opioid-settlement-spending/,N.J. announced a plan to guide governments on how to spend over $1B in opioid settlement funds. A court fight in Irvington shows why it's needed.,"A Reach NJ poster along Pacific Ave. in Atlantic City on Feb. 13, 2023. (Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)A state panel on Thursday issued a five-year strategic plan advising New Jersey communities how to spend over $1 billion in national opioid settlement funds they’re expected to receive over the next decade and a half.
The plan comes as an escalating court fight over two “opioid awareness concerts” in Irvington shows such guidance may be overdue.
Investigators from the state comptroller’s office have raised concerns about fraud, misuse of money and contract and ethical improprieties after Irvington paid nearly $370,000 in opioid settlement funds in 2023 and 2024 to two entertainment companies — both tied to a township employee — that ran the concerts, according to a defamation lawsuit Irvington filed in April. The comptroller’s office was set to release a report on investigators’ findings when the township sued to block its release.
The state’s strategic plan announced Thursday — drafted by an advisory council convened in 2023 — offered no definitive answers on whether drug awareness concerts are an acceptable use of settlement funds. Instead, the council said spending should be evaluated on an array of metrics to ensure it is “data-driven and equity-focused.”
The settlement funds come from pharmaceutical companies and others that helped fuel the opioid crisis, and the settlement agreements arose from separate claims by states and local governments. The state of New Jersey and its local governments will each get about half of the more than $1.1 billion in funding expected to flow to New Jersey through 2038.
Thursday’s plan is intended to guide the disbursement of the state’s share of settlement funds, “though hopefully it will prove a helpful tool for subdivision decision-making,” said Tom Hester, a state Department of Human Services spokesman.
“The state does not provide legal advice nor approve or deny local proposals related to subdivision settlement funds. Subdivisions are encouraged to review the national and state subdivision agreements for guidance on how these funds may be used,” he said.
County and municipal officials must publicly report each year how they spend settlement funds, which began disbursing in 2022.
Some reported that they haven’t started spending yet. But those that have invested in things like direct services to people struggling with addiction, drug-awareness school assemblies and community events, and Narcan training and supplies for government employees.
The reports give a snapshot of the various ways officials have spent funds, including:

Union County paid for transportation to treatment centers, with the goal of removing that barrier to recovery.
Salem County used some funds to build up its overdose fatality review team.
Paterson spent part of its distribution on medication-assisted treatment.
Middlesex County spent some on “go bags” — filled with Narcan, drug-testing strips, addiction treatment information, and more — to give people discharged from the county jail.

Irvington was the only municipality that used its funds to host concerts, according to the filings. Berkeley Township reported that it shared educational materials on safe medication disposal and drug drop box locations at an annual scheduled summer concert series — but did not spend settlement funds to do so.
In Irvington’s 2024 filing, township officials reported that Irvington has received almost $1.1 million in settlement funds since 2022.
They reported that they opted to host the opioid awareness concerts after doing “internal research on the benefits and effectiveness of concerts and festivals in making the community and stakeholders (aware of) the impact of opioid use and misuse.” They did not engage the public to help decide how to use the funds, have a strategic plan, complete a risk assessment for demographic or geographic impact or measure key performance indicators to track the success or impact of the spending, according to their filings.
Local officials unsure what would be sanctioned uses of opioid settlement funds “should seek legal advice from their own counsel and/or guidance ‌from their respective County Advisory Council,” said Allison Inserro, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office.
The plan’s particulars
The strategic plan recommends that officials plotting how to spend settlement funds should prioritize harm reduction services, addiction treatment and social services that fix problems, like housing insecurity, that can impede recovery.
Its overarching goals are to reduce overdose deaths, remove barriers to treatment and build “a robust monitoring and evaluation framework” to track the funds’ impact and ensure accountability, according to a Department of Human Services announcement.
Overdose deaths have fallen in New Jersey since an epidemic high of 3,171 in 2022, with 2,816 overdose fatalities reported in 2023, 1,813 in 2024, and 490 so far this year, state data shows. Health officials largely have credited harm reduction efforts for the decline.
The state already has allocated at least $120 million of the funds it has received. State officials announced last year that $95 million would support housing, harm reduction and mobile units to deliver medication-assisted treatment and $25 million would go toward free legal services for people struggling with addiction, an initiative to reduce teenage addiction and emergency response needs like xylazine-testing kits to reduce misuse of a horse sedative known as “tranq” or “zombie drugs.”
Human Services Commissioner Sarah Adelman chairs the advisory council that issued the strategic plan Thursday.
“While no amount of settlement payments can undo the harm and human toll of the opioid crisis, we can and must ensure New Jersey uses the funding wisely to help our residents and communities recover,” Adelman said in a statement.
Hundreds of people who have struggled with addiction shared their thoughts with the advisory council, resulting in a “strong plan that prioritizes evidence-based harm reduction, treatment, and recovery services,” she said.
Meanwhile, in Irvington …
Late last month, a state appeals judge granted Irvington’s request to block the comptroller’s office from releasing its findings on the drug awareness concerts.
The office already had given early copies, as is its practice, to Gov. Phil Murphy, Senate President Nick Scutari, and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin. So last week, Judge Mark K. Chase made an unusual move — he extended the injunction to them, forbidding “any government entity or official” from distributing the comptroller’s report on Irvington any further.
Irvington’s attorneys have complained that state investigators did not let them adequately respond to their findings.
In a brief filed last week, they wrote that the report “reads like a ham-handed and overly-broad Drew Pearson serial with an accusatory purpose.” They warned that it threatens to irreparably harm the township’s reputation, endanger vendor contracts, hurt the township’s ability to carry out public health initiatives, and erode the trust of state and federal officials who interact with the township.
“All of those harms would be especially pernicious in Irvington, a predominantly Black and minority community, which has historically faced discrimination in oversight and in governance,” the attorneys wrote.
But Friday afternoon, the comptroller’s office snagged a win.
Chase denied Irvington’s injunction request, calling the matter moot because the report had already been released to 
Murphy and top legislative leaders.
Besides, the comptroller’s office had given the township 15 days to respond to its draft report, Chase added. Officials “failed to do so. They now complain of the contents of the report,” the judge wrote.
He gave Irvington until 4 p.m. Monday to ask the state Supreme Court for relief, saying his stay on the report’s release should remain in place until then.



But, the judge added, “any further suppression of OSC’s report hinders its statutory mandate and oversight role, and directly harms the public interest.”

Newsom lambasts Trump for giving immigrants’ health data to deportation officials,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/06/newsom-trump-immigrant-data-deportation-medicaid/,"Many undocumented immigrants have long feared that their Medi-Cal data would be used against them. Newsom calls it ""an abuse.""","In summary
Many undocumented immigrants have long feared that their Medi-Cal data would be used against them. Newsom calls it “an abuse.”


Calling the move “legally dubious” and an “abuse,” Gov. Gavin Newsom today heavily criticized the Trump administration after reports surfaced that personal medical information — including immigration status — is being shared with deportation officials.
The governor’s comments come as protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are being held in parts of downtown Los Angeles for the eighth day in a row. 
According to the Associated Press, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to give the Department of Homeland Security immigration and other medical data for millions of non-citizens. The data transfer includes information about California enrollees and other states that allow immigrants without legal status to enroll in health services, according to the AP. 
The order overturns longstanding federal policy that prohibits the agency that oversees the nation’s publicly operated health programs from sharing private enrollee data with other federal agencies.
During the first Trump administration, many groups that assist people with Medi-Cal enrollment reported high levels of mistrust of government programs and declining enrollment because of the fear that it could be used to refuse citizenship applications or initiate deportation proceedings. 
“Sharing Medicaid beneficiary information with the Department of Homeland Security – which is itself legally dubious – will jeopardize the safety, health, and security of those who will undoubtedly be targeted by this abuse, and Americans more broadly,” Newsom said in a statement. 
In a letter sent to states last month, Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said he was putting states “on notice” that he would no longer allow “federal dollars to be diverted” for immigrant health care. 
“Medicaid is not, and cannot be, a backdoor pathway to subsidize open borders,” Oz said in a news release accompanying the letter. 
Trump administration officials, including Oz, have previously claimed without evidence that states like California are illegally using federal money to pay for immigrant health care. 
Newsom’s office confirmed that the state’s Medicaid agency, the Department of Health Care Services, responded earlier this year to a federal data request to show that the state was not improperly using federal funds, which cannot be used to pay for health services for immigrants without legal status. 
Six other states and the District of Columbia allow immigrants to enroll in some state-funded health programs, but none are as expansive as California’s. All states are required to provide emergency Medicaid to immigrants.
California currently uses more than $8.5 billion in annual state revenue to provide coverage to about 1.6 million immigrants through Medi-Cal, the state’s version of Medicaid.
Newsom’s office did not say whether it planned to sue to block the use of Medicaid data for immigration enforcement. But spokesperson Elana Ross said in a statement that the administration would “explore all avenues to protect Californians’ information and safety.”
“The federal government continues to instill fear across this nation and shroud its continued violation of Americans’ privacy rights in propaganda,” Newsom said.
California officials, including the Department of Health Care Services, have long reassured immigrants without legal status that their data would not be shared with federal agencies for immigration enforcement. 
The state health care services department refused to answer questions about sending information to the federal government, instead directing CalMatters to Newsom’s statement.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/121923_MediCal-Expansion_LJ_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-13 15:57:13.782636

(Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Complaints from the farm and hotel industries that President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort is costing them valued workers will prompt change, Trump promised Thursday in a post on Truth Social.
“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” wrote Trump, who owns a number of hotels in the U.S., including one in Las Vegas. 
“It’s a very simple thing to say, ‘we’re going to secure the border and we’re going to deport violent criminals and terrorists.’ Everybody agrees with that,” Culinary Local 226 Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said during a phone interview Thursday. “When you bring in the Marines to arrest dishwashers, that backlash is exploding in industry, among citizens and voters. If there’s one thing this president knows how to do it’s to backtrack quickly when he gets a backlash.”
The U.S. employed more than 782,000 farm workers in 2023, according to the government. About two-thirds are immigrants, according to the government.
The leisure and hospitality industries in the U.S. employ some 14 million people, and almost one-third are immigrants, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.
Nevada’s hospitality and leisure industries employed 368,400 people as of April, according to the Federal Reserve.
“These industries are run by very smart people, and they understand that the immigrant workforce powers this economy,” said Pappageorge.
Pappageorge said he’s not bothered by a carve-out from the deportation policy for two industries, suggesting agriculture and hospitality are just the first two to the table.
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who endorsed Trump and was endorsed by Trump, did not respond to inquiries about whether he’s reached out to the White House regarding the president’s deportation plan and disruption to the labor force.
The Nevada Resort Association, which represents casino hotels in Nevada, referred the Current to the American Hotel and Lodging Association.
“Along with our members, we continue to communicate with Congress and the administration about the importance of building a strong hospitality and tourism workforce,” the AHLA, which represents 32,000 properties, said in a statement. “As an industry, we are committed to strict compliance with labor laws and immigration regulations, including those focused on recruitment, background checks and employment verification.”
The hospitality industry is already reeling from a precipitous drop in travel resulting from Trump’s trade wars, Bloomberg reported last week.
“The AHLA urges Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and strengthen the H-2B visa program, which allows temporary non-agricultural work in the U.S., and the J-1 visa program, which allows participation in exchange programs,” says the AHLA website. “We believe that the United States can have both an effective and welcoming legal immigration process that enables hotels and other businesses to meet our workforce needs, while also protecting our national security.”
How Trump plans to exclude workers from the two industries from deportation is unknown.
“They could do this by prosecutorial discretion possibly,” said Michael Kagan, director of UNLV’s Immigration Clinic. Immigrations and Customer Enforcement (ICE) has the option to close cases and allow individuals to avoid deportation.

Jerry Moran demanded commitments from federal officials during hearings Thursday to keep airspace safe at Reagan Washington National Airport, the site of a deadly collision in January. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran pressed federal officials Wednesday on how they intend to ensure safety at the Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C., in the wake of a January crash between a passenger plane from Wichita and an Army helicopter that left no survivors.
Moran, a Kansas Republican, questioned U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Federal Aviation Administration administrator nominee Bryan Bedford at separate committee hearings Wednesday on whether they would commit to keeping in place restrictions on non-essential helicopter flights around the D.C. airport.
“It’s my understanding, from information from the Army, that since Jan. 29, seven flights have taken off and landed at the Pentagon,” Moran said to Hegseth. “Six of those flights occurred during periods of high volume at DCA. One of those aircraft caused two different commercial flights to abort landing on May 1, and since this latest incident, I understand that all flights have been halted.”
Since the January crash, Moran has pushed for aviation reforms, introducing legislation that mandates in busy airspace the use of Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast, or ADS-B, which automatically transmits an aircraft’s location to nearby pilots once per second. The legislation also removes the possibility for pilots to opt out of using ADS-B.
Moran introduced that legislation after close calls at the same airport where the crash took place. The Pentagon, which is less than two miles away from Reagan National as the crow flies, halted military helicopter flights near the airport. The legislation has been in a committee awaiting action since it was introduced in early May.
Moran wants the flight restrictions in place until the FAA can come up with a safe route, if there is one.
Hegseth, in response, said no authorization for VIP or convenience flights exists in that area.
“You have our assurance that I’m working with (Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy) very closely to make sure that the only flights that would be — even in a modified path — would be those that are necessary and are authorized,” Hegseth said.
Moran sits on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, where he questioned Hegseth, and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, where he requested a commitment from Bedford to maintain safety restrictions.
“My understanding is the FAA is supreme when it comes to the control of the airspace,” Bedford said. “But we want to be good partners with the Department of Defense, and we have protocols on how to do that — multiple protocols, as I understand.”
The FAA creates military operating areas, which include restricted and prohibited spaces, and line of fire space and alert zones, and determines the airspace classifications around airports. The busiest airports, like Reagan, are Class B airspace. Bedford said the FAA can accommodate the U.S. Department of Defense’s needs, but he added, “we can’t have this mixed-use traffic in Class B airspace.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250913_moran-1024x451.png,,,2025-06-13 15:57:13.782636

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A University of Northern Iowa employee is suing the institution after she was demoted from an assistant vice president position, alleging discrimination against her age that led to her taking a pay cut as well as her title and some duties being handed off to younger coworkers.
Shelley O’Connell, former UNI assistant vice president and executive director of Student Health and Well Being and current assistant to the vice president, filed suit against the university and the Iowa Board of Regents June 2 and requested a trial by jury. According to court filings, she is seeking funds “in an amount which will fully and fairly compensate her for her injuries and damages” like emotional stress, lost wages and more.
“As a proximate result of Defendants’ actions … Shelley O’Connell has in the past and will in the future suffer mental and emotional harm, anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, loss of dignity, lost wages and benefits, loss of professional career, and lost earning capacity,” the court filing stated.

The 59-year-old started working at UNI in 2001 as an administrative assistant, the filing stated, and according to her LinkedIn profile, O’Connell earned a master’s degree in educational leadership and administration from the institution in 2007.
She moved into the assistant vice president position in 2022. In her time in the role, the court filing stated O’Connell received positive performance evaluations and received an award for her “outstanding dedication and service.”
In August 2023, O’Connell had a meeting with her then-supervisor Heather Harbach, the university’s vice president for student life, according to the filing, during which Harbach asked O’Connell if she had any plans of stepping down or moving out of a role supervising staff. These questions were “motivated by (O’Connell’s) age,” the filing stated, to which O’Connell replied she had no interest in retiring or stepping away.
This exchange led to distance between the coworkers, according to the filing, and O’Connell brought her concerns to the university’s Title IX office, saying she felt Harbach was trying to make her vacate her position based on her age.
“Shelley remained committed to her job and providing the best service to the University that she possibly could,” the filing stated.
Harbach informed Shelley of her demotion in April 2024,  according to the filing, providing the new title and saying her duties specific to her previous role were being transferred to Allyson Rafanello and Nick Rafanello, a married couple.
The employees Shelley oversaw were transitioned to work under one of the new assistant vice presidents, and Shelley’s pay was reduced by more than $50,000. Allyson Rafanello received an around-$50,000 pay increase for the new duties, the filing stated.
In addition to holding the assistant vice president title, Allyson Rafanello is the dean of students and Nick Rafanello is the executive director of university housing and dining.
“Shelley will have to work longer than she had anticipated because her wages were slashed by more than $50,000 per year, thereby delaying her ability to retire,” the filing stated.
The plaintiff also had 15 more years of experience at UNI than the new assistant vice presidents, according to the filing, and decades of experience in health care and public health. One of her previous duties was overseeing all university medical facilities, which was transferred to the Rafanellos after her demotion.
UNI, and the board of regents, committed age discrimination by setting higher standards for O’Connell than her peers, the filing stated, as well as not treating her equally to younger employees, allowing discrimination from her supervisor, demoting her and offering less pay.
UNI spokesperson Pete Moris said the university “does not comment on pending legal matters.” The university must provide an answer to the petition within 20 days of its filing to the Polk County courthouse.

(Ed Murray for New Jersey Monitor)A handful of New Jersey’s Assembly primaries remained too close to call early Friday afternoon, and counts for some races were poised to stretch until provisional ballots are tallied next week.
Most of the state’s races were decided on or shortly after Election Night due to a 2022 law that allowed election officials to prepare mail ballots for counting ahead of Election Day. But candidates in a handful of contests were separated by fewer than 200 votes, leaving final tallies up to provisional ballots that won’t be counted until next week.
“The legislature and the Governor saw a problem, and they saw a need to fix it, and apparently they have fixed it because now we seem to be a fast-counting state, or at least we were this time,” said Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics.
In the 31st District, where voters gave Hudson County Commissioner Jerry Walker the Democratic nomination, Assemblyman William Sampson’s (D-Hudson) lead over Assemblywoman Barbara McCann Stamato (D-Hudson) narrowed somewhat after county election officials updated vote tallies Thursday.
Sampson leads his onetime running mate, who sought reelection under gubernatorial hopeful and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop’s slogan, by 194 votes, down from 308 on Wednesday.
Hudson officials on Thursday reported there were 101 vote-by-mail ballots and 698 provisional ballots yet uncounted. Those could be enough to bring McCann Stamato back to second place in the district’s primary. They’re unlikely to save her running mate, Jacqueline Weimmer, who lags Sampson by 403 votes.
Election officials will continue receiving late-arriving mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day until 8 p.m. Monday, though those ballots are typically small in number. Provisional ballots can only be counted after the end of the mail-voting grace period. In some counties, officials aren’t counting more ballots until next week.
Not all outstanding ballots will have been cast in Democratic primaries, and some mail and some provisional ballots won’t be counted because the voters who cast them were ineligible to vote, among other deficiencies. Voters whose mail ballots are rejected have until June 18 to cure them.
The contest for a second seat in the 20th District remained tight Friday morning. There, independent Democrat Ed Rodriguez leads party-backed Union County Commissioner Sergio Granados by 105 votes with Assemblywoman Annette Quijano (D-Union) in a distant first place.
There were 543 mail ballots and 707 provisional ballots left uncounted in the Union County-based district late Thursday. The race remains too close to call and will likely be decided by provisional ballots. The uncounted ballots won’t be enough to bring Walter Wimbush, Rodriguez’s running mate, into contention for the seat.
Rodriguez is among the independent Democrats who performed well in races that featured opponents on competing slates backed by party organizations and Fulop.
“When you get a one-on-one, you can say, ‘Well, the other guy stinks,’” Rasmussen said. “But when you’ve got six candidates — as we did in the gubernatorial field and as we did in some of these Assembly races — it’s not enough to say the other guy stinks. You’ve got to say, ‘No, this is why I’m the best and I deserve your first or your second vote.’”
Outstanding ballots in the 35th District appear to favor Assemblyman Al Abdelaziz (D-Passaic), who leads his party-backed running mate, Passaic County Commissioner Orlando Cruz, by 261 votes for second place.
Nearly all votes are counted in the Bergen County portion of the district, where only 18 mail ballots and 44 provisional ballots remain untallied. Passaic has more outstanding votes: 1,195 between both categories, and Abdelaziz ran ahead of Cruz in the county.
Newark Corporation Counsel Kenyatta Stewart, who ran on an independent ticket, leads the assemblyman by 1,301 votes — more than the number of ballots currently outstanding — and will go on to face Republicans Nelvin Mercado-Duran and Rawell Perez-Muñoz in November. The district has not had a Republican member in three decades.
A second-place race between Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla and Assemblywoman Jessica Ramirez (D-Hudson) in the 32nd District remained tight. Bhalla leads the incumbent, who ran on Fulop’s slate, by 194 votes with 717 mostly provisional ballots left uncounted as of Thursday afternoon.
Former New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency chief of staff Katie Brennan leads Ramirez by 497 votes and is virtually certain to be one of the district’s Democratic nominees. Brennan, whose accusations of sexual assault against a 2017 Murphy campaign staffer roiled Trenton, ran with Bhalla on an independent ticket.
“This was a district where voters were paying attention and had really good choices, and I think the result of picking Katie Brennan at the top of the field is really a remarkable outcome for a housing advocate and a planner and somebody who we know about, given her experience with the Murphy campaign in the early days of the Murphy administration,” Rasmussen said.
The three remaining candidates, Jersey City Councilman Yousef Saleh, Crystal Fonseca, and Jennie Pu, are not in contention for either seat.
Some other contests remain close.
In the Democratic primary in the 2nd District, Fulop-aligned Bruce Weeks trails Joanne Famularo, who has party backing, by just 82 votes with 1,026 ballots uncounted. The district is held by Republican Assembly members Don Guardian and Claire Swift, who were unopposed in the GOP primary.

Vitello said interest in the rally has grown following the Trump administration’s crackdown on mostly nonviolent protests in Los Angeles and the recent forcible removal and handcuffing of U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-C.A.) by federal law enforcement at a Department of Homeland Security press conference.
Such actions have come in defiance of federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, where Trump has deployed the National Guard against demonstrators.
“As much as what we were all warned about what a second Trump term could be like, it’s gone far beyond what people could have envisioned,” Vitello said.
Saturday’s protests are timed to coincide with the national military parade in Washington D.C. meant to celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday — along with President Trump’s 79th birthday. Saturday is also Flag Day.
Indivisible Rhode Island, which organized the demonstration at India Point Park, referred to the D.C. festival as a “vanity parade” on its website. The group also organized the “Hands Off!” rally outside Kennedy Plaza in April against proposed cuts to federal funding.
Among those speaking at the India Point Park rally will be Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat.
“I am pleased to know that there is a movement where thousands of people all across the country and especially right here in our backyard of Providence, Rhode Island are here to take a stand,” Morales said in an interview.
The national festival and parade are expected to cost between $25 million to $45 million, according to reporting by States Newsroom. It will feature roughly 6,700 soldiers from every division, 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, 34 horses, two mules and one dog.
But the parade will not include any members of the Rhode Island National Guard. Col. Brenton Groeneveld, a spokesperson for the Guard, confirmed the state will not participate in or provide any support for the parade.
“​​The RING was not asked or tasked with providing any support to the June 14 parade,” Groeneveld said in an email.
The No Kings coalition projects millions of demonstrators will take the streets of over 2,000 cities and towns across the country — just not the nation’s capital.
“Real power isn’t staged in Washington,” national organizers wrote on the coalition’s website. “It rises up everywhere else.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Inmate Stephen Stanko, who was sentenced to death twice in separate cases, is set to be put to death at 6 p.m. Friday.
The 57-year-old is scheduled to be the sixth inmate executed since the state resumed executions in September. He chose to die by lethal injection, as his attorneys questioned whether the state had properly carried out previous death sentences.
A 4th SC death row inmate opts to die by lethal injection following concerns over firing squad

A federal judge and an appeals court declined to halt Stanko’s execution earlier this week. His attorneys asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene Thursday.
If the nation’s highest court doesn’t step in, Stanko’s final hope of avoiding the death chamber would be for the governor to grant him clemency. Gov. Henry McMaster, a former prosecutor and state attorney general, has declined to commute the sentences of any inmates previously executed.
Appeals
After Stanko’s attorneys unsuccessfully petitioned the state Supreme Court for more information about the state Department of Corrections’ execution protocols, Stanko chose to die by lethal injection.
His decision was to avoid the electric chair, which legislators made the default in 2021, and not because his concerns about other methods were assuaged, he wrote in a statement attached to the decision.
2 SC legislators call for independent investigation into latest execution

Stanko’s attorneys filed a separate appeal, this one in federal court, raising concerns about all three of the state’s allowed methods of execution: lethal injection, electrocution and firing squad.
The firing squad, in particular, has been under scrutiny by the state’s death row lawyers and some legislators after an autopsy of the last inmate executed in the state, Mikal Mahdi, showed two bullet holes instead of the expected three. The bullets also appeared not to have hit Mahdi squarely in the heart, as they had for a previous inmate, according to the autopsy report.
The marksmen, shooting at a target 15 feet away, might have intentionally missed the target to cause more suffering for Mahdi, who was put to death for killing a police officer, the attorneys claimed in their filing.
The state corrections department argued two bullets struck Mahdi in the same spot and followed the same path through his body. The bullets did hit his heart, the marksmen didn’t miss, and the target was properly placed, the state has said in legal filings.
Next, Stanko’s attorneys argued the state’s use of two “massive” doses of the sedative pentobarbital in at least two of the three previous lethal injection executions also suggests something went wrong. One inmate, Freddie Owens, declined an autopsy for religious reasons.
Attorneys for the state have said this is the state’s protocol and nothing has gone amiss in any executions carried out since September.
A federal judge declined to intervene. U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel wrote in an order Wednesday he would not rule on firing squad arguments since that was not Stanko’s selected method. Furthermore, he saw no cause for intervention based on the previous lethal injection executions, he wrote.
The crime
Stanko’s crime spree began April 7, 2005, at the Murrell’s Inlet home he shared with his girlfriend, librarian Laura Ling.
Ling’s 15-year-old daughter woke at about 1 a.m. to find Stanko standing over her in her bedroom. She ran to her mother’s bedroom, where she found Ling incapacitated and bleeding on the floor beside the bed, according to court records.
Stanko tied up, beat and raped Ling’s daughter, then choked Ling to death. He slit the daughter’s throat and left her for dead before packing a suitcase, stealing Ling’s credit card and jewelry, and fleeing in Ling’s car, according to court records.
Around 4 a.m., Stanko called a friend, Henry Turner. Stanko lied saying his father had died and asked Turner if he could spend the night.
SC executes second death row inmate by firing squad

Turner agreed and called his partner, who lived in Charlotte, to tell her. He ended the call in his usual style, saying, “I love you, brown eyes,” Cecelia Kotsipias later testified in court.
The next morning, after getting the two of them breakfast, Turner went to shave his face in the mirror. Using a pillow as a silencer, Stanko came up behind Turner and shot him in the back, according to court documents.
Stanko then struck Turner and fatally shot him in the chest.
Stanko took Turner’s truck, stole money from his bank account and drove to Columbia. There, he spent an evening posing as a businessman and buying people drinks at bars before taking off for Georgia.
In Augusta, Stanko told a woman he met that he was in town for the Masters golf tournament. A charming man, as people who knew him later testified, he convinced her to let him stay at her house.
Stanko stayed there until April 12, before leaving abruptly in the middle of the night. After his departure, the woman recognized Stanko’s photograph in the newspaper alongside a headline about Turner’s death. She called the police, who apprehended Stanko before he left the city, according to court records.
Back home, Stanko had a reputation as a scam artist. Over the years, he was charged and convicted more than a dozen times for stealing money, computers and cars from employers and falsely posing as a lawyer.
Stanko also had served a prison sentence for kidnapping his then-girlfriend with the intent to kill her. While serving that sentence, he helped write the book “Living in Prison: A History of the Correctional System with an Insider’s View,” alongside researchers Wayne Gillespie and Gordon A. Crews.
Stanko was released from prison for that crime about a year before committing those that would land him on death row.

Stanko never claimed innocence, instead arguing he had brain damage that caused him to commit the killings. Two separate juries, in 2006 and 2009, convicted Stanko of murdering Ling and Turner. The juries recommended death sentences for each of the crimes.
It’s Turner’s killing for which Stanko is set to be executed Friday. His appeals in the other case are ongoing.
Stephen Stanko
Growing up, Stanko was smart and well-liked. Although his father could be harsh and his parents weren’t particularly involved in his life, Stanko was outgoing and cheerful at school, teachers and neighbors recalled during his trials.
He was a member of the honor society, Beta Club, and junior engineering club, as well as an escort at school pageants and vice president of the school’s Spanish club. He placed in a regional competition for the Olympics of the Mind, in which students would participate in academic challenges, former teachers said.
“He was, I think, a role model to the other students,” one of his middle school teachers, Barbara Poland, testified. “I think the other students really did look up to him.”
As an adult, Stanko remained intelligent and charming, his former girlfriend, Elizabeth Buckner, testified. But she saw a darker side to him, too, in the four years they were together, she said.

Stanko lied to Buckner repeatedly about work, telling her he’s been promoted when really he’d been fired or saying he was starting a side business selling cars without telling her the cars were stolen.
Stanko had an “inability to speak the truth about anything,” Buckner testified.
“He ran into trouble in every position that he held,” she said.
When Buckner confronted Stanko, he tried to knock her out using a combination of chemicals. When that didn’t work, he tied her up. He pleaded guilty to kidnapping and assault and battery with the intent to kill, according to court documents.
Henry Turner
Turner was a jester, both literally and figuratively.
He was a member of the Royal Order of Jesters, an invite-only faction of Shriners for which Turner would don clown makeup and the distinctive fez to ride tiny cars in parades. He was always making jokes and acting eccentric, friends and family testified during Stanko’s 2009 trial.
Turner, who served as a master sergeant in the Air Force, loved to wear a pair of red, white and blue joggers wherever he went, said his partner Kotsipias. At first, she asked him to wear something else, but eventually, the pants grew on her.

“Everywhere we’d go, he got attention by these pants, and I grew to love them, too,” she said.
Turner loved fishing, and he passed down the passion to his three children and six grandchildren, his children testified. When his daughter, Debbie Gallogly, needed a break from the chaos of two younger brothers, her dad would take her out on the lake.
“We don’t have his laughter, or his humor, or his intelligence, or his compassion,” Gallogly testified. “All of that is erased when you lose a family member, and to lose someone the way that he died — it hurts my heart so bad to know the circumstances surrounding my father’s death.”
At the time of his death, Turner had been working for Stanko to make extra money so he could take Kotsipias on a cruise, she said.
“We had a wonderful life together, and Stephen Stanko has ruined our lives,” Kotsipias said. “He has ruined it entirely, because Henry would have been living today. We would have been fishing, we would have been singing, we would have been having a wonderful time together.”
Laura Ling
Christina Ling remembered her mother as a hard worker. After divorcing Christina Ling’s father, Laura Ling worked a job at a library, raised her three children and earned a master’s degree in library science all at once, Christina Ling testified in 2006.
“It was tough, but she did it, and she was so successful,” Christina Ling said.
Laura Ling also helped at her friend Rebecca Cahly’s greenhouse, often working harder than even Cahly herself for little or no pay. Really, Ling would ride her children’s bikes to help because she liked the time she could spent chatting with Cahly, the friend testified.
A talented seamstress, Ling handmade Halloween costumes and Christmas stockings so elaborate that Cahly, a seamstress herself, said Ling must have put more than 100 hours of work into them.
“I wish that I would have asked her to teach me how to sew and stuff before she passed away, because I’m not very good at it,” Christina Ling testified.

Laura Ling loved playing tennis and watching movies with her children. When Cahly went through a difficult pregnancy, Ling made a habit of calling her up and, instead of saying hello, yelling into the receiver, “I love you.” If Christina was around, she’d join in, Cahly testified.
A couple years before Laura Ling was killed, she and her daughter went through a rough patch, spurred in part by Ling’s preoccupation with her other children, her job and her degree. Hoping to work it out, Christina Ling wrote her mother a letter that she later found buried in the bottom of her mother’s purse.
“You have been my mom and on some occasions even my dad, my tennis mate, my friend, my mentor through the good and the bad,” Ling wrote in the letter, which she read in court. “To be honest, I’m sure we have got a lot of bad ahead of us, but just know that I’m going to be sticking it out there with you and that I love you very much.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0019-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 15:57:13.782636

“You never want to close the road, but a two-day closure has a lot less impact on everyone,” said Bob Hammond, resident engineer with the Wyoming Department of Transportation. WYDOT plans to close the road to traffic during the weekend of June 21.
Without the closure, work needed to finish fixing the “Big Fill” landslide — last year’s catastrophic failure of a 30-yard chunk of Wyoming Highway 22 over the steep mountain pass — could stretch over 10 days or more. Keeping the road open during construction would mean resorting to one, alternating lane of travel.

“It would just back up horribly,” Hammond said of the traffic that would result.
 Crews will work 24 hours a day to expedite Teton Pass project

During peak traffic hours, delays could be so substantial that motorists might opt for the longer detour anyway. When the mountain pass closes, commuters from the Idaho side of the Teton Range, where housing is cheaper than Jackson Hole, typically re-route their daily travel through Swan Valley, Alpine and the Snake River Canyon. That adds roughly 1 hour and 6 minutes to what is usually a 24-mile and 32-minute drive.

Community stakeholders have generally agreed that it’s best to end the disruption quickly, said Stephanie Harsha, a WYDOT public relations specialist who has been working with Teton County organizations to get the word out about the closure slated for 6 p.m., June 20, through 6 a.m. June 23.
“I think people understand how we came to the decision,” Harsha said. “We’re very thankful for their support. When we do close it, we are disrupting commerce and the economy because there are so many commuters. We understand the impact it has in the area.”
Crews will work 24 hours a day to expedite milling, grading, placing crushed base and paving. They’ll also install guardrails and signs.
The highway will be closed between the Coal Creek Campground on the west side and the gate at mile marker 7 on the east side. People can still bike and otherwise recreate on the east side of Teton Pass and access the Coal Creek Campground on the west side. But WYDOT is warning walkers and bikers to beware of heavy trucks and not descend from the top of the pass down the west side toward the Big Fill work site.
The June 7, 2024, landslide made national news, spurring local businesses to reassure visitors they could still reach Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. But the closure also highlighted the vulnerabilities of a mountain community’s robust tourism and lifestyle economy.

 Teton Pass essential to travel for workers, visitors and school kids

That so much depends on a single road became evident just last week when a trailer lost its load on Highway 22, blocking both lanes of travel near the Snake River bridge.
On June 5, Hammond started receiving texts from contractors working in Teton County on a second major WYDOT project, building a new four-lane bridge over the Snake River between Jackson and Wilson. The multi-year, $60 million bridge reconstruction and intersection redesign is expected to wrap up in July.
A log cabin fell off a trailer, “at least twice,” including on the WYDOT jobsite. Crews moved some concrete barriers to give the abode a temporary home.
“We were able to get that cabin off the road to get the lanes open,” Hammond said. “Otherwise, it was blocking the entire road.”
The transport company had tried to move the Etna-bound cabin in the middle of the night but quickly ran into trouble, the Jackson Hole News and Guide reported Friday. The sudden sight of a cabin taking up residence on the bridge spawned some humor on social media, with commenters posting on Facebook, “rent is 3k as it sits”; “Hey you can’t park there” and “someone move in, squatters rights!”

But it also seriously snarled the morning commute, backing eastbound traffic all the way up Teton Pass and disrupting travel for workers, visitors and school kids, who had their tardies excused. Even after the road reopened, it took another four hours to clear the congestion, Hammond said. The cabin was finally removed Saturday morning, he said, “before everyone was up.”
Although unrelated to the Teton Pass project, the cabin debacle shows how long it can take to clear traffic once commuters from Idaho get stacked up, Hammond said.
Highway 22 between Jackson and Teton Village Road sees about 18,000 vehicles per day on average — but 24,000 in July and August with a peak of 27,000, according to WYDOT data. The stretch over Teton Pass to the Idaho state line sees an average of 10,000 vehicles per day. In the height of summer, daily trips jump to around 16,000 west of Teton Village Road and 10,000 east of Victor, Idaho. For comparison, the divided four-lane stretch of Interstate 80 between Green River and Rock Springs accommodates an annual average of 25,000 vehicles per day.
Knowing how any disruption can create problems on the busy Teton corridor, WYDOT wanted to give at least two weeks advance notice of the upcoming weekend pass closure so workers could plan ahead.
“We wanted to give them an opportunity to maybe set up an alternate schedule,” Hammond said. “We can’t really reach all the tourists, but we’ll be putting up variable messaging signs.”
 A permanent fix?

After the road first failed, WYDOT contracted for $900,000 with Evans Construction to put in an emergency detour. That got the vital highway reopened within 20 days. Now Ames Construction is putting the finishing touches on the permanent fix to the tune of about $43 million.

The detour functioned well but has an 11.3% grade and a 20-mph speed limit. The rebuild follows the original, more gentle contour that uses fill material to create a bridge between two hills, hence the name “Big Fill.” The speed limit will return to 45 mph with a speed advisory that likely will be set at 35 mph, Hammond said.
Although WYDOT had observed movement there for decades, Hammond said, “it wasn’t a big concern until it was. When it slid out.”
WYDOT hired a geotechnical engineer with experience working on landslides around the country and has taken steps to avert future problems.
The three factors that contributed to the slide were lubrication, too much weight “or driving force” on top of the fill and too little “resisting force” holding the bottom together, Hammond said.
“When you get all three together, that’s typically when landslides happen,” he said.
So crews have inserted drains at the base of the fill so groundwater doesn’t pool there like it did before. Workers have excavated and drilled “micro piles” — steel rods inside a casing — in a pattern to stitch  together the ground beneath the new fill to increase “resisting force.” To reduce “driving force,” the new fill includes lightweight material that cuts the total weight in half to around 60 pounds per cubic foot compared to the typical 120-125 pounds per cubic foot, Hammond said.
Hammond credits both Evans and Ames with getting the job done quickly in the face of catastrophe.
“We got some contractors who understood what they had to do and how important it was,” he said.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A version of this story originally appeared in the Utah News Dispatch.
The group pushing for a rail line in eastern Utah that would allow the state to ramp up oil production is hoping to fund the project through $2.4 billion in U.S. Department of Transportation bonds.
The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition for years has been lobbying for the 88-mile Uinta Basin Railway, which would connect the oil-rich region of northeastern Utah to national rail lines, facilitating the export through Colorado of waxy crude oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast.
To pay for the railway, the coalition — which consists of representatives from Dagget, Carbon, Duchesne, Emery, San Juan, Servier and Uintah counties — approved a resolution last month announcing its intent to seek $2.4 billion in private activity bonds from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
That’s a $500 million increase from 2023, when the coalition passed a similar resolution seeking $1.9 billion in federal bonds.

The railway extension could allow for the transport of an estimated 350,000 barrels of oil each day, massively increasing the state’s oil production. The refineries in Salt Lake City, for instance, currently have a market capacity of 85,000 barrels per day.
But connecting the Uinta Basin to national rail lines means increased oil exports through Colorado, which has proved to be a major sticking point. In 2022, environmental groups and Colorado’s Eagle County sued the coalition, arguing that the federal Surface Transportation Board — the agency tasked with the environmental review — fell short in its analysis, failing to consider the risks of the railroad expansion.
Down the Line: Tracing the route — and risks — of Utah’s proposed Colorado-bound oil trains

The project cleared a major roadblock in May after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a prior court ruling that found the environmental review was incomplete. The ruling returns the case to a lower court for consideration.
“This was not only a win for the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition and counties in the state of Utah, but a win for the United States in being able to move forward with a major infrastructure project,” said Greg Miles, a Duchesne County Commissioner who sits on the board of the coalition, during a public meeting Thursday. “There’s a lot of things that oil does for us in our lives.”
And although it still faces regulatory and legal hurdles, the coalition has made several moves over the last month toward financing the railroad. On Thursday, it heard public comments related to the bonds.
The Department of Transportation’s Private Activity Bonds program is a tax-exempt financing option from the federal government aimed at supporting private-public partnerships. The program has financed bridge replacements, highways, rail lines and other transportation-related ventures.
That $2.4 billion is the total estimated cost for the project, according to the coalition, although it’s unclear how much money will come from private investments.
But funds for the bond program are running dry. According to the department’s data, there’s only $500 million left to allocate, the program having dished out $29.4 billion of its $30 billion cap. It’s up to Congress to replenish the program.
“How is the coalition going to get this money? And when?” asked Deeda Seed with the Center for Biological Diversity during the meeting Thursday.
Seed also raised concerns over the “ballooning” cost of the railway, which has increased in the last few years.
“How does this project pencil out? We have no clue, the public has no clue, especially when President Trump hopes the price of oil will decline to $40 to $50 per barrel,” she said.
Just about all of the roughly two-dozen commenters on Thursday spoke against the railway, and using bonds to fund it — they cited concerns over the project’s rising cost, potential harm to wildlife and habitat, the negative impact on air quality, and how a derailment could harm the Colorado River and the people who rely on it for drinking water.
“I deplore subsidizing the increase of oil production in the Uinta Basin, which will increase the ozone and air pollution, at a time when all federal subsidies are being cut for renewable energy,” said Joan Entwistle, a Summit County resident. “It’s just another example of how we’re putting the thumb on the scale for fossil fuels.”
“The tariffs are being imposed at a level of 50% for steel. Clearly, that is going to raise the prices. Railroads are notorious for cost overruns,” said David Bennett, also a Summit County resident.

The Republican president’s March 25 executive order sought to compel officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for everyone registering to vote for federal elections, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline.
The attorneys general had argued the directive “usurps the States’ constitutional power and seeks to amend election law by fiat.” The White House had defended the order as “standing up for free, fair and honest elections” and called proof of citizenship a “commonsense” requirement.
Judge Denise J. Casper of the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts said in Friday’s order that the states had a likelihood of success as to their legal challenges.
“The Constitution does not grant the President any specific powers over elections,” Casper wrote.
Casper also noted that, when it comes to citizenship, “there is no dispute (nor could there be) that U.S. citizenship is required to vote in federal elections and the federal voter registration forms require attestation of citizenship.”
[RELATED: CT one of 19 states suing Trump over elections order]
Casper also cited arguments made by the states that the requirements would “burden the States with significant efforts and substantial costs” to update procedures.
Messages seeking a response from the White House and the Department of Justice were not immediately returned. The attorneys general for California and New York praised the ruling in statements to The Associated Press, calling Trump’s order unconstitutional.
“Free and fair elections are the foundation of this nation, and no president has the power to steal that right from the American people,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said.
The ruling is the second legal setback for Trump’s election order. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., previously blocked parts of the directive, including the proof-of-citizenship requirement for the federal voter registration form.
The order is the culmination of Trump’s longstanding complaints about elections. After his first win in 2016, Trump falsely claimed his popular vote total would have been much higher if not for “millions of people who voted illegally.” Since 2020, Trump has made false claims of widespread voter fraud and manipulation of voting machines to explain his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
He has said his executive order secures elections against illegal voting by noncitizens, though multiple studies and investigations in the states have shown that it’s rare and typically a mistake. Casting a ballot as a noncitizen is already against the law and can result in fines and deportation if convicted.
Also blocked in Friday’s ruling was part of the order that sought to require states to exclude any mail-in or absentee ballots received after Election Day. Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Oregon and Washington, which conduct their elections almost entirely by mail, filed a separate lawsuit over the ballot deadline, saying the executive order could disenfranchise voters in their states. When the lawsuit was filed, Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs noted that more than 300,000 ballots in the state arrived after Election Day in 2024.
Trump’s order has received praise from the top election officials in some Republican states who say it could inhibit instances of voter fraud and will give them access to federal data to better maintain their voter rolls. But many legal experts say the order exceeds Trump’s power because the Constitution gives states the authority to set the “times, places and manner” of elections, with Congress allowed to set rules for elections to federal office. As Friday’s ruling states, the Constitution makes no provision for presidents to set the rules for elections.
During a hearing earlier this month on the states’ request for a preliminary injunction, lawyers for the states and lawyers for the administration argued over the implications of Trump’s order, whether the changes could be made in time for next year’s midterm elections and how much it would cost the states.
Justice Department lawyer Bridget O’Hickey said during the hearing that the order seeks to provide a single set of rules for certain aspects of election operations rather than having a patchwork of state laws and that any harm to the states is speculation.
O’Hickey also claimed that mailed ballots received after Election Day might somehow be manipulated, suggesting people could retrieve their ballots and alter their votes based on what they see in early results. But all ballots received after Election Day require a postmark showing they were sent on or before that date, and that any ballot with a postmark after Election Day would not count.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25113797609746-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 14:56:54.334930

(Getty Images)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”













Now they’ve seen measles in their community so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’


– Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas





In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”

 Measles outbreak moves north in the U.S.

In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”

Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-25 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-20 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.

 ‘Cautiously optimistic’ measles outbreak is improving in Texas

According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 6, there are 1,168 confirmed cases affecting 33 states. Texas reported two more cases June 10, and Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 17 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Former dean Cameron Wright, whose demotion sparked campus uproar, alleges UW President Ed Seidel pressured him to make an improper budget transfer and retaliated after Wright refused. 
The post Ousted engineering dean sues University of Wyoming, seeks job back appeared first on WyoFile .","Ousted University of Wyoming engineering dean Cameron Wright sued the school this week over his demotion, alleging retaliation by university President Ed Seidel. 
Wright’s large group of vocal supporters on and off campus has maintained Seidel maneuvered for the then-dean’s ouster after he protested the transfer of a portion of the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences’ funding to a new school of computing. That new school is run by Seidel’s romantic partner.
Wright, who remains a university professor, has largely stayed quiet in public. But in his legal complaint, filed Thursday in Albany County District Court, his attorney alleges Seidel “personally and through third parties improperly pressured” Wright to sign off on the transfer of $500,000 to the College of Computing, though university guidelines dictated Seidel should stay out of the matter given his relationship with computing dean Gabrielle Allen.
When the former dean refused, Seidel orchestrated his ouster, the complaint alleges. 
Wright declined to comment Friday, citing the advice of his attorney, May Elizabeth Galvan. She also declined to comment on the lawsuit. In a brief statement, UW spokesperson Chad Baldwin said the school contests Wright’s depiction of events.
“The university disagrees with allegations made in the complaint and will vigorously defend against it,” Baldwin wrote.

According to previously disclosed records, Wright opposed the transfer because he believed it violated legislative direction to spend the money on the engineering college. Specifically, Wright argued the money was allotted toward a long-held goal from state leaders to push that college into the top tier of engineering schools nationwide. 
Seidel and other university officials, including the school’s trustees, have argued the budget transfer was proper and say Wright was let go for failing to sufficiently advance the school’s Tier 1 goal. 
Ultimately, it was the trustees who voted to remove Wright from his deanship, not Seidel. They voted to do so unanimously in a closed session in early April. But in the complaint, Wright’s attorney alleges the board made the decision “at Dr. Seidel’s insistence,” though the complaint does not elaborate on how the former dean knows that. 
Ahead of his demotion, the complaint alleges that Seidel retaliated against Wright through “public dissemination of false information concerning [Wright’s] tenure as Dean of the College of Engineering and Physical Science.”
And after the vote, as the university community erupted in furor over the widely popular dean’s removal, the trustees also denigrated Wright’s reputation, the complaint alleges. 
“Following [Wright’s] removal as Dean, the University of Wyoming Board of Trustees, acting in their official capacities, publicly disseminated otherwise confidential information falsely denigrating his performance as Dean,” the complaint reads. According to the lawsuit, Wright was demoted, though he received good performance evaluations and had no disciplinary or negative incidents on his record. The demotion also came over the objection of the 10 engineering college department heads, who backed Wright and sought to head off his demotion in a letter to the trustees before they took their vote.

The lawsuit asks a judge to order UW to reinstate Wright as dean, award him back pay and attorney fees and for “further relief as may be just and equitable.” 
Wright’s demotion led an overwhelming majority of the faculty senate to back a vote of no confidence against Seidel on April 7. It also led the deans of the university’s other colleges, except Allen, to write a letter to Seidel and the trustees expressing “deep concern for the trajectory of the university.” 
Two major donors to the university also publicly announced they were reconsidering their financial support after the demotion. 
This is a developing story.

(Shasti Conrad/WA Dems) Washington state Democratic Party chair Shasti Conrad is getting another shot at a leadership post with the Democratic National Committee and a voice in retooling the political strategy for the national party.
Conrad is one of three women vying for a vice chair position in a do-over of the Feb. 1 election won by Malcolm Kenyatta.
In that bid, Conrad made the case to voting delegates that the formula that brought Democrats success in Washington last year — a sweep of nine statewide executive posts, gains in their majorities in the Legislature and defeat of three conservative-backed ballot measures — is one the party can use to win back control of Congress and the White House.
Her message hasn’t changed heading into balloting this weekend.
“We’ve won elections year after year. Today, through recruitment efforts and organizing, we’re gaining ground in red communities,” she says in a one-minute video sent to the roughly 400 people who will vote.
If elected, she vowed to “focus on winning elections, constituency organizing, and changing lives for the better.”
In February, Kenyatta and David Hogg were elected as vice chairs. But those contests were invalidated after a complaint that contended the party failed to follow its own rules on gender parity in officer elections. 
DNC members decided this week to rerun elections for those seats. Only candidates who made it to the final round of voting in February and are eligible for each seat under party rules, can compete.
The new elections are being conducted separately, with ballots cast virtually.
Hogg, a 25-year-old gun-control activist and the party’s first Gen Z vice chair, isn’t running to keep his seat. He’s faced backlash from fellow Democrats for his plans to support challengers to incumbent Democrats with his group, Leaders We Deserve. His critics contend that party officers need to be neutral in primaries.
Hogg’s exit left Kenyatta as the only eligible candidate in the first election because the position must be filled by a male under the DNC rules. Voting began Thursday and ends Saturday for the spot held by Hogg.
Conrad, Kalyn Free, a national committee member from Oklahoma, and Jeanna Repass, chair of the Kansas Democratic Party, are competing to be second vice chair. A candidate of any gender can hold this seat. For this position, voting begins at 7 a.m. Sunday and runs through 2 p.m. Tuesday. 
Free filed the complaint that set the new elections in motion.
Conrad led the King County Democrats for four years before being elected chair of the state Democratic Party in 2023 and re-elected in January. She is the first South Asian woman to lead a state party.
She enjoys strong ties to DNC Chair Ken Martin, who appointed her in March to be an associate chair for the national party. In this role, she said she’s strived to spotlight issues of importance to Asian Americans and to work with influencers on ways to better engage younger voters.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_8020-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-13 14:56:54.334930

Gov. Phil Scott’s three-month extension for this group is set to expire June 30 – and local service providers say the state’s interpretation of the governor’s order caught them off guard.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Over 300 highly vulnerable households will lose eligibility for Vermont’s motel voucher program by the end of June.
That’s because an executive order that extended motel stays for families with children and people with acute medical needs is set to expire June 30. A spokesperson for Gov. Phil Scott confirmed this week that the Republican governor does not plan to extend the order.
By July 1, 348 households currently housed under the order will reach the end of their eligibility period if they don’t transition out of the motel program beforehand, according to Monika Madaras, director of communications and legislative affairs for the Department for Children and Families’ Economic Services Division.
“It’s probably going to be very similar to what we saw last September,” said Miranda Gray, the deputy commissioner of the division. Last fall, over 1,500 people were evicted from motels – including families with young children who resorted to camping – prompting widespread public outcry.

The impending expiration was a surprise to some organizations and local officials who serve unhoused Vermonters, because of widespread confusion about how the program’s time limits would work.
Current law says people can receive 80 nights of emergency housing per year. But any motel stays during the winter months – December through March – do not count toward that time cap.
Scott signed the executive order in late March, just as that winter eligibility period was slated to end. Lawmakers had sought an extension for everyone sheltered through the program at that time to halt another mass eviction, but Scott fiercely opposed the effort, twice vetoing a midyear spending bill over the disagreement. Instead, he took executive action to extend stays for a narrow group of people, writing at the time that “we have an obligation to protect children and Vermonters who are most vulnerable.”
The order states that “the 80 day maximum shall be waived” between April and June for eligible households, “to allow time for DCF to ensure” they have access to services and supports needed to transition to a long-term housing, shelter, or healthcare placement.
DCF communication to providers after the order came down in March stated that the order “lifts the 80-day limit,” allowing eligible people to remain housed through June 30, 2025. It did not specify that days during this period would count toward the cap.
Many service providers understood the phrasing to mean that people sheltered under the executive order would not accrue days toward the 80-day limit. But DCF recently sent notices to clients stating the opposite.
“Your household is part of a special group covered by Executive Order No. 03-25, which may allow you to get more than 80 days of housing assistance through June 30, 2025,” states a draft notice, dated June 3, posted on the department’s website. “However, any days you use under this executive order still count toward your 80-day limit.”
The notice caught many off guard.
Sarah Russell, Burlington’s special assistant to end homelessness, believed households covered under the executive order group would have their 80-day clocks essentially frozen until June 30. 
“My assumption originally was that this was an extension of the adverse weather conditions,” she said, referring to the winter exception period. “I think that was a pretty universal assumption among providers.”
Russell did not think there would be another mass eviction until the fall.
But department officials interpreted the executive order to mean that enforcement of the 80-day limit would be paused for these households between April and June, allowing people to stay put even if they had surpassed that cap.
Gray said officials sent out the notices earlier this month after they realized there was a misunderstanding.
“When it became clear that there was confusion, then we wanted to make sure that it was clear for people,” Gray said. 
Madaras, the DCF spokesperson, said the Agency of Human Services has ramped up its efforts to support people in the executive order group who are willing to accept services.
Asked how many households the state has helped ensure alternative accommodations for past June 30, Madaras declined to provide a number.
“The Department does not systematically collect data on clients’ living arrangements after they exit the program,” she said. 
If the past is any indication, however, at least some of those households will pitch tents come July 1.
To Brenda Siegel, an advocate with End Homelessness Vermont, the state’s effort to winnow down which unhoused people count as the most vulnerable was already unconscionable. But evicting this group that officials have deemed the most at risk of harm if unsheltered is worse.
“After identifying them, the first next move is going to be to send them to live outside,” Siegel said. “That is just horrifying for our state to do.”

(Photo credit: Daniel Gitlin/DOTD)Gov. Jeff Landry is making leadership changes at the state highway department that will go into effect Monday.

In a statement issued Thursday, the governor’s office said Department of Transportation a Development Secretary Joe Donahue will move from that post to become the agency’s executive counsel. Glenn Ledet Jr. will leave as executive director of the Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority to become DOTD’s new secretary.
Also, Eric Dauphine, DOTD’s current Lafayette region administrator, will become a deputy secretary for the department.
“Joe has done an outstanding job in one of the most thankless roles in state government. Louisiana’s roads and infrastructure are in dire need of reform, and Joe worked every day to move DOTD forward despite the challenges,” Landry said in the statement. “Now, he’s returning to his passion — practicing law — and I know he’ll bring the same dedication and integrity to his new role as DOTD Executive Counsel. I’m excited about the new era of leadership Glenn and Eric will bring to the department.”


Ledet departs the CPRA after a year and a half as its leader and previously working as administrator of its operations division. The authority has state-level oversight of major coastal infrastructure projects in Louisiana. The governor credited Ledet with CPRA’s  implementation of the state’s $50 billion Coastal Master Plan.


The governor’s office shared no information on plans for Ledet’s replacement at CPRA.


The incoming DOTD secretary’s background includes 13 years in civil and environmental engineering, including management positions with private companies that have worked as contractors for the state transportation department.  Ledet holds an environmental engineering degree from LSU and is licensed as a civil engineer in multiple Gulf Coast states.


“I am honored and grateful to Governor Jeff Landry for the trust he has placed in me to lead DOTD,” Ledet said in a statement. “I look forward to working alongside the agency’s dedicated team and partners throughout the state to strengthen Louisiana’s transportation network. Together, we will focus on delivering efficient and safe infrastructure that meets the needs of Louisiana’s residents, communities, and businesses both now and in the future.”

Donahue has worked with Landry since the governor held the attorney general’s post. In addition to his time at DOTD, Donahue has also been a staff lawyer with the state Department of Environmental Quality.

His exit comes as state lawmakers have approved a package of Landry-backed bills that call for greater efficiency and accountability at DOTD, while also giving the governor more say-so on state highway spending. The changes will include a new deputy secretary of transformation. Landry’s office has not clarified whether Dauphine is filling this position or an existing deputy secretary’s position.

Donahue is the third member of Landry’s cabinet to move out of their role since the governor took office in January 2024, and the first to stay within state government.

Madison Sheahan left her job as secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries in March to become deputy director for U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The move reunited her with Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem, for whom Sheahan worked when Noem was governor of South Dakota.

Last month, Aurelia Skipwith Giacometto resigned as DEQ secretary to take a job with a Washington, D.C. law firm.

They're tightening that aid in a way that would deny it to people convicted of felonies.,"In summary
California Democrats set aside millions of dollars for immigrant legal services. They’re tightening that aid in a way that would deny it to people convicted of felonies.


After a fiery debate months ago over services for immigrants, California Democrats are quietly responding to Republican criticism by restricting immigrants convicted of certain crimes from accessing a state-supported legal defense fund.
A budget agreement advanced by the Legislature this week would prohibit roughly $40 million in state funds from providing deportation defense or other immigration legal help for immigrants convicted of any felony. 
It’s one way Democrats, who in the last decade trumpeted sanctuary policies for immigrants and more lenient treatment for those accused of crimes, have subtly adjusted their approach on both issues amid persistent Republican criticism and more hardline voter sentiments. 
While some state funds earmarked for immigration legal services already come with restrictions preventing money from being used to help people with “serious or violent” felony convictions fight deportations, the new language would apply to any felonies. Legal aid providers said that could include property crimes, shoplifting, or writing a bad check. 
“This is very damaging and it diverts from the purpose of the bill,” said Kathy Brady, directing attorney of Immigrant Legal Resource Center. 
Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas’ spokesperson Nick Miller, in a statement, said the language was still subject to negotiation as the budget moves to Gov. Gavin Newsom. But he acknowledged the restriction was a response to a political skirmish over the funding in January.
Created in 1999, the Equal Access Fund distributes money to legal aid organizations throughout the state to provide civil legal services to low-income residents who cannot afford a lawyer. It is funded annually by the Legislature, but has never before faced restrictions in its application. The money serves “the people who need it most in California,” including those at risk of deportation, eviction or domestic violence, according to the State Bar, which administers the fund. 
The fund covers a wide range of legal services, including for issues around housing, domestic violence and immigration. Roughly 34 of the fund’s 89 grantee organizations used part of their money to provide immigration legal services, said Doan Nguyen, director of the Office of Access and Inclusion at the State Bar, in a statement to CalMatters. Last year, grantees helped over 30,000 Californians resolve roughly 31,000 legal problems, she said. It’s not clear how many immigrants with felony convictions, if any, have been served through the funds. 
“This prohibition would have a devastating impact on low-income Californians seeking immigration legal assistance, likely stoking fear and creating a chilling effect on client communities in need of vital legal services,” said Nguyen. “Additionally, the restriction would impose significant administrative and financial burdens on nonprofit legal aid organizations that will be forced to find alternative funding sources just to screen clients for eligibility.
Newsom stresses cooperation with ICE in some cases
Republican lawmakers sharply criticized their Democratic colleagues earlier this year over funneling an additional $10 million to the fund to protect vulnerable Californians during the new Trump administration. 
Another state fund, specifically earmarked for immigration legal services and distributed by the Department of Social Services, already comes with the restrictions on serious or violent felonies. Lawmakers earlier this year also added $10 million to that program.
Republican Assemblymember Leticia Castillo from Corona introduced an amendment to add more language barring the money from those with felony convictions, but Democrats shot it down. The Republican caucus slammed the votes for blocking “common-sense efforts to prevent taxpayer funds from being used to shield illegal immigrant felons … from the consequences of their actions.”
“These votes show just how out of touch the Democratic supermajority has become,” Assembly Republican leader James Gallagher of Chico said in a news release in February.
Newsom signed the bill with a note, “None of the funding in this bill is intended to be used for immigration-related legal services for noncitizens convicted of serious or violent felonies.” He urged lawmakers to pass another law saying so, “to the extent further clarification is necessary.” 
Miller said the new budget language reflects that.
“The Legislature doubled-down on investments in legal aid this year, because immigrant workers, students and parents need support more than ever in the face of Trump’s raids and terror,” he said. “The governor’s message from January regarding aid and felons, and any draft language, will be discussed during ongoing budget negotiations.”
In a state where politicians have fiercely opposed Trump’s deportation plans, Newsom has made the arrest and deportation of immigrants with felony convictions his line in the sand, noting state prison officials have transferred more than 10,000 former inmates to immigration authorities’ custody since he took office in 2019.
When lawmakers floated expanding the state’s sanctuary law to prohibit prison officials from cooperating with ICE, Newsom quickly quashed the bill by saying he would veto it.
“When these guys say we don’t go after criminals, they’re lying,” he told MSNBC last Sunday, referring to Republican arguments about Democrats’ stance on immigration enforcement.
‘Not the time to exclude more people’
But legal experts and advocates were alarmed to see such a broad carve out for people with felonies on their record, especially amidst the routine criminalization of immigrants.
“There’s always a story to get into that we don’t see when you just paint somebody broadly with that brush of, ‘You have a felony conviction,’” said Shiu-Ming Cheer, deputy director of immigrant and racial justice at California Immigrant Policy Center. “This type of restriction moves us in the opposite direction from actually being able to support immigrant Californians.”
Longtime GOP consultant Mike Madrid said Democrats have “finally wised up.”
“You can’t just have a blank check for everybody who’s otherwise convicted of a felony,” he said. “The appetite for the American public is not there.” 
Over 70 organizations on Thursday sent a letter to lawmakers and Newsom, urging them to oppose the restriction.
“Legal representation is the backbone of a fair process and often the only way for individuals to assert their rights, remain with their families, and protect themselves from targeted abuse,” they wrote. “California needs to be a leader in protecting immigrant communities, it is not the time to exclude more people from accessing legal representation. Everyone deserves due process.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)In my long career as an immigration lawyer, I have spent a lot of time contemplating what it means for something to be legal. So often when folks find out what I do for a living they like to tell me that they really do support immigration to the U.S. as long as it is legal. Conversely, a lot of people also seem to approve, either eagerly or tacitly, of punishment for non-citizens who they perceive to do things illegally. For many the situation is a binary: if you do it legally, you are welcome, but if you do it illegally, then you deserve whatever our government cooks up to punish you, even as it becomes more and more severe. 
What’s challenging for me when I talk to people in that frame of mind is that most of them have absolutely no clue what it means to immigrate to the United States legally or illegally. They are fired up or filled with conviction but can rarely explain how it all works. The immigration system is incredibly complex and is constantly being rearranged as public policy seismically shifts, sometimes on a daily basis. That complexity does not hold up against steady propaganda from our political leaders, and by extension our mainstream media, who insist that the only necessary analysis is that non-citizens in our country have done something illegal and need to be harmed. Sadly, the easy explanation is the one that prevails in people’s minds. 
I remember a time when I was representing a woman who came to the United States and lawfully sought political asylum. She was detained (because we detain asylum seekers even when they have not broken any laws) and she was pregnant. She ended up miscarrying her pregnancy in federal custody while shackled — something unimaginably brutal. When sharing her story, I remember people saying to me that if she hadn’t wanted that to happen, she shouldn’t have broken the law. It repulsed me to hear her condemned to such a horrifying fate based on someone’s incorrect perception that she was a criminal. I don’t believe criminals should experience things like that, much less someone who has never broken a law in our country. 
These perceptions can create terror in our communities. In New Mexico and nationwide, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now savagely hunting a massive group of people who entered the United States through a parole program set up by the Biden Administration, legally obtained work authorization and are working on their removal cases in Immigration Court. People in this posture have not done anything illegal as it pertains to our immigration system. They followed every authorized step put before them and complied with the requirements of the government. A person can question whether the system was good public policy on the Biden administration’s part, but the people who availed themselves of it didn’t break a single law. 
And yet these folks have unilaterally had their paroles cancelled, been stripped of their work authorization and when they show up to court, as is required by law, ICE is having their cases dismissed, arresting them on site, detaining and deporting them. You can watch ghoulish videos of people being cornered in federal buildings by masked agents or snatched off the streets and stuffed into vans. The people I talk to are simply terrified. When government officials are asked to account for this injustice and violence, they simply say that these people are illegal immigrants who didn’t follow the law. This explanation is a lie. 
Our president and his ICE force, bolstered now by the military, are expecting our compliance with authoritarian violence against our non-citizen family, friends, colleagues and neighbors based on a very flimsy explanation that people are criminals or that they have done something illegal. They are expecting us to nod our heads and accept that millions of people with complex immigration histories and statuses in this country deserve to be treated with the utmost brutality. And now they are promising to turn that brutality on all of us if we don’t. 
Even though I am a lawyer and I am supposed to honor what is  legal and illegal in our immigration system, I can’t do that exclusively. Those words have been used in such a manipulative manner — so carelessly, so incorrectly — that they have warped our collective sense of right and wrong around this issue. And ultimately that is what matters most to me: what is right and what is wrong. 
What ICE is doing in New Mexico and nationwide is simply wrong. We know it in the pits of our stomachs when we hear stories of parents ripped from their children, when we watch videos of masked agents snatching people off the street and when we see our communities absolutely terrorized by this modern American gestapo. We can shrug and believe our government that tells us this is a necessary violence because people broke the law, or we can choose to think more critically, to learn and to listen to our gods or the small voices inside of us saying that nobody, no matter where they were born, deserves to be treated so inhumanely. 
Laws come and go and change all the time. The legal system is not etched in stone but cobbled together by so many forces, some good and some bad. It is sometimes an expression of morality, but it is more often an expression of political power and greed and control and fear. The law is going to keep on changing as we continue to reckon with our identity as a nation but what we will be left with is what we did with our own senses of right and wrong in this moment. I know what ICE is doing is wrong and because of that, action must follow.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/californiaprotests-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 13:57:14.575124

Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, participates in a forum hosted by the Sutherland Institute at the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics on Oct. 14, 2024. (Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)A version of this story originally appeared in the Utah News Dispatch.
Utah Sen. Mike Lee is bringing back a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Utah, Colorado and other Western states.
Lee says it will open up “underused” federal land for housing and help communities manage growth — opponents, including a number of Democrats in Congress and environmental groups, say it’s an attempt to pay for tax cuts and warn it will jeopardize access to public lands.
Introduced Wednesday evening, Lee’s amendment to congressional Republicans’ budget bill, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill,” renews an effort initially spearheaded by Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, and Mark Amodei, R-Nevada, that sought to dispose of 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah and some 450,000 acres of federal land in Nevada.
But Lee’s proposal is much broader — rather than earmark specific parcels of land for disposal like Maloy and Amodei’s amendment, Lee wants to require the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture to sell off a percentage of land managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
According to the amendment, both agencies would be required to dispose of between 0.5% to 0.75% of land they manage, which amounts to about 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. State and local governments would be allowed to nominate parcels of land, and would be granted priority to purchase.

Eleven states would be eligible — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Notably, Montana is exempt, and Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke was instrumental in sinking Maloy and Amodei’s original proposal, stating that selling public lands is a line he would not cross.
Though the scope is much bigger, Lee’s reasoning behind the proposal is the same as Maloy and Amodei’s — identify parcels of federal land near high-growth areas, and sell them at market value to local governments to use for housing, water infrastructure, roads and other development.
The amendment prohibits the sale of land that’s already designated, like national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas or national recreation areas. Land that has an existing right, like a mining claim, grazing permit, mineral lease or right of way is also off limits.
If it passes, the secretaries of the departments of Interior and Agriculture would have to prioritize nominating land that’s next to already developed areas, has access to existing infrastructure or is “suitable for residential housing.” The amendment also directs the secretaries to nominate land that’s isolated and “inefficient to manage,” and to reduce the checkerboard land pattern, the result of railroad grants in the 1800s that left small plots of private land scattered within swaths of federal land and vice-versa.
“We’re opening underused federal land to expand housing, support local development and get Washington, D.C. out of the way for communities that are just trying to grow,” Lee said in a video address. “We’re talking about isolated parcels that are difficult to manage, that are better suited for housing and infrastructure. To our hunters, anglers and sportsmen, you will not lose access to the lands you love. Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands.”
But that reasoning didn’t fly for a number of environmental groups, including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, which called Lee’s proposal an attempt “to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”
“Senator Lee’s never-ending attacks on public lands continue. His hostility stands in stark contrast with Americans’ deep and abiding love of public lands. Senator Lee’s plan puts Utah’s redrock country in the crosshairs of unchecked development,” said Travis Hammill, Washington, D.C. director for the alliance. “In Utah and the West, public lands are the envy of the country — but Senator Lee is willing to sacrifice the places where people recreate, where they hunt and fish, and where they make a living.”
The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, called Lee’s amendment “a shameless ploy to sell off pristine public lands for trophy homes and gated communities that will do nothing to address the affordable housing shortage in the West”; the National Wildlife Federation dubbed it a “fire sale” that is “orders of magnitude worse” than Maloy’s proposal; The Wilderness Society said it was “a betrayal of future generations and folks on both sides of the aisle” and warned that could spark political backlash.
Maloy’s proposal identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George. The land would have been used for water infrastructure (like reservoirs and wells), an airport expansion in St. George, new and widened roads, recreation and housing.
The proposal was widely celebrated by the water district and local governments, who said it would help them make adjustments as the region continues to experience rapid growth. But nearby tribes, environmentalists and politicians from both sides of the aisle were skeptical.

Newborns will be screened for more rare diseases. Cities will have to consider heat mitigation when drafting master plans. Those are just a few of the real-world outcomes of the hundreds of bills passed by the Democratic-controlled Nevada State Legislature and signed into law by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
The session officially adjourned June 2 but won’t truly be over until the governor signs or vetoes each bill that passed. Lombardo has until Friday to approve or reject the bills or else they automatically become law.
In 2023, the first-term governor did not allow any bills to automatically become law, opting instead to take a stance on each piece of legislation that came across his desk. (Lombardo’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, did the same.)
As of Friday morning, the Legislature’s website listed 515 bills as signed and an additional four bills awaiting approval or veto. Eighty-seven bills were vetoed.
Here’s a look at more than a dozen bills the Nevada Current has previously covered that have now been signed into law:

Working teens Teenagers will soon be prohibited from working between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. before a school day, thanks to Assembly Bill 215, sponsored by Assemblymembers Daniele Monroe-Moreno and Brian Hibbetts, a Democrat and Republican, respectively. Teachers and students pushed for the change, citing the negative impact lack of sleep has on learning, mental and social health. The new restrictions, which do include some exemptions, go into effect on Oct. 1.
Regional rail group Nevada will soon form a Regional Rail Transit Advisory Working Group to assess the need for regional rail systems in Southern and Northern Nevada and look at potential funding sources for such systems. The group was created by Assembly Bill 256, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch of Reno. The working group will be composed of lawmakers, transit experts and county representatives. They are expected to deliver to lawmakers a report in July 2026 with “an actionable plan” for achieving regional rail transit and recommendations to the 2027 Legislature.
Wrong-way driving Driving on the wrong side of the road will soon be a misdemeanor crime, following the passage of Republican Assemblymember Brian Hibbetts’s Assembly Bill 111. Previously, wrong-way driving was only a civil offense. Nicknamed “Jaya’s Law” after 3-year-old Jaya Brooks who died in a wrong-way crash in Las Vegas last year, AB111 was unanimously supported by lawmakers and goes into effect Oct. 1.
Protections for health care providers Employees and volunteers of reproductive health care facilities, as well as their spouses, domestic partners or minor children, will soon be able to request a court order that keeps their personal information confidential on otherwise public records within the offices of county recorder, county assessor, county clerk, city clerk, Secretary of State, or Department of Motor Vehicles. Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth’s Assembly Bill 235 saw some bipartisan support in the Legislature before being signed by the Republican governor. The legislation goes into effect July 1.
Right to Contraception Assembly Bill 176, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Selena Torres-Fossett, strengthens protections against a state or local government burdening access to contraceptive measures.
Newborn screenings Nevada will expand the number of rare but treatable conditions newborn babies are screened for, thanks to Senate Bill 348, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Julie Pazina. The expansion is being funded through an increase in the fee hospitals pay the Nevada State Public Health Lab. The prior rate had been the same for more than a decade and kept Nevada behind what the federal government recommends for newborn screening.
Raises for elected officials Many county elected officials will get a raise with the passage of Senate Bill 116, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Skip Daly. The bill establishes a formula to elevate the pay for the elected district attorney, sheriff, county clerk, county assessor, county recorder, county treasurer and public administrator of each county. The formula keeps those public servants’ pay above the highest paid person in their office. Meanwhile, commissioner salaries across the state are also being bumped up by a set amount, followed by 3% annual increases for five years starting in 2026. The changes will go into effect in July with the new fiscal year.
Foster parents People with criminal records of marijuana possession for amounts that are currently legal are now eligible to become foster parents. Democratic Assemblymember Tracy Brown-May sponsored Assembly Bill 107 for Clark County, which told lawmakers that otherwise qualified Nevadans are being needlessly turned away. The state faces a critical shortage of foster homes.
Water rights Nevada will establish a Voluntary Water Rights Retirement Program that allows willing landowners to sell their water rights back to the state through the year 2035. The program was established by Assembly Bill 104 and unanimously supported.
Charters behind on PERS With Senate Bill 418, the Nevada State Superintendent of Public Schools will be able to withhold a charter school’s state-funded per-pupil dollars if the charter school is more than 90 days delinquent in retirement contributions to the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Nevada (better known as PERS). Administrators for PERS told lawmakers a mechanism for recouping the contributions is needed because of the unique quasi-public nature of charter schools.
Local input on tax abatements Companies seeking massive tax abatements will have to enter into agreements to defray the costs of the government-provided services they require. Storey County, home to the heavily abated Tesla Giga Factory, sponsored Senate Bill 69.
Heat mitigation Cities and counties with populations exceeding 100,000 people must include “heat mitigation” as part of their master plans, following the passage of Assembly Bill 96.
Inmate firefighters Democratic Assemblymember Jovan Jackson sponsored a bill, Assembly Bill 321 to require the Nevada Department of Corrections to create a program to allow formerly incarcerated people to work as firefighters within the Division of Forestry. The program is expected to help recidivism rates.
Medical respite care Nevada’s Department of Health and Human Services will apply for a federal waiver to amend the state Medicaid plan to cover medical respite care for people experiencing homelessness. The requirement was passed in Senate Bill 54.
Net proceeds of minerals The Net Proceeds of Minerals Bulletin will soon be public again. Long made publicly available by the state, a new interpretation of state law resulted in the bulletin being kept private. Assembly Bill 277 makes the bulletin public again. The bill was sponsored by Republican Assemblymember Rich DeLong and had the approval of the mining industry.
Tax increment areas Senate Bill 28 creates “tax increment areas” in which a portion of future property tax revenue can be used to pay interest on bonds used to finance affordable housing development and public transit. The bill, sponsored by the City of Las Vegas, saw some bipartisan support in the Legislature.
Mental health The Medicaid reimbursement rate for mental health providers will increase through Senate Bill 353, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Marilyn Dondero Loop.
Immigration guardianship Assembly Bill 460, sponsored by Assemblymember Cecelia González, streamlines the process for selecting a temporary guardian for minors prior to any immigration action.
Insulin costs Assembly Bill 555  prohibits private insurance companies from charging people more than $35 for a 30-day supply of insulin. The bill, sponsored by, Democratic Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager,  received broad bipartisan support, with only Senate Republicans John Ellison and Robin Titus opposing.

 No signature needed

Democratic Assemblymember Joe Dalia’s Assembly Joint Resolution 8, which would let voters in 2028 decide whether Nevada should establish a dedicated business court, also passed the legislative finish line. Resolutions are not subject to vetoes by the governor.
AJR1 is now set to return to the 2027 Legislature for consideration. If lawmakers pass the resolution again, it will appear in front of voters on the 2028 general election ballot for final approval.
A dedicated business court could entice large companies to incorporate in Nevada and settle their corporate litigation here, Dalia and other proponents of the resolution have argued.
Nevada Supreme Court Chief Justice Doug Herndon announced the court would try to establish a dedicated business court on its own as early as next year. Herndon said in a statement he didn’t believe AJR1 to be necessary.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/legi-building-cropped-1024x547.jpg,,,2025-06-13 13:57:14.575124

The century-old dam is a crucial one. Not only is it responsible for maintaining the water level in South Pond, but it also controls the flow of water out of the pond and into the lowlands.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published by News & Citizen on June 12.
Just south of the popular summer destination of Lake Eden lies a quieter body of water.
South Pond, an idyllic retreat populated mostly by modest bungalow camps and accessible only to property owners, is, like many such bodies of water in the state, managed by a collective. The South Pond Land Owners Association charges a small annual fee for the maintenance of roads and property owned by the association, and the cost of insurance.
Among the shared assets is a small dam at the pond’s northwestern edge where it feeds into a tributary that eventually runs into the Gihon River. The 2-foot-thick concrete core is embedded within a sloping earthen wall, with only a concrete auxiliary spillway at the hill’s summit and a green box sitting just beyond it in the water as clues to its existence.
The century-old dam is a crucial one, however. Not only is it responsible for maintaining the water level in South Pond, but it also controls the flow of water out of the pond and into the lowlands. It was reclassified within the last few years from a “significant hazard dam” to a “high hazard dam” by the state, a designation indicating the outsized risk for loss of life and property should the dam fail. South Pond Dam is one of five dams with such a designation in Lamoille County.
This increased risk designation, though it has nothing to do with the condition of the dam — both the landowners association and the state attest to it being in excellent shape and at no risk of failure — and the increasing scrutiny of state regulators toward privately owned dams has pushed the South Pond community to take proactive measures to ensure the safety of their dam, which has meant a greater shared cost.
A routine inspection of the dam in 2022 concluded with the state recommending that the hydrologic and hydraulic analysis studies be conducted to evaluate the dam’s performance, including a detailed dam failure analysis, and act on the recommendations that come out of those studies.
After the issue was discussed by association members, the majority decided to begin conducting such studies despite the increased expense to its members.
“As one association member put it at our last annual meeting, we feel we have a moral obligation to follow up on the (dam safety program) inspection recommendations in order to minimize the risks to the people living downstream,” association officer Mark Frederick said.
A history of the South Pond dam
Even before the dam was built, South Pond had been a notable water formation in the county, albeit an inaccessible one, locked away in an Edenic wilderness considered remote even by Vermont standards, although the Lamoille Newsdealer noted in 1871 that was used by the local community as a reservoir.
In 1922, a St. Albans utility company constructed the dam, expanding the pond and turning it into a reserve for downstream hydroelectric facilities, or basically turning the pond into a big battery, as Ben Green, head of the state’s dam safety program, put it.
The dam failed in the flood of 1927, contributing to the most devastating deluge Vermont has experienced to date, according to Frederick. A dam inspector brought up from New York a year later declared it to be safe, but worth watching at times of heavy rain, according to a contemporaneous report in the News & Citizen.

In the intervening decades, campers marked out their territory along South Pond’s shores. The dam was acquired by the now-defunct Central Vermont Public Service. Property owners and the utility coexisted peacefully for years, until the owners petitioned the state to tighten regulations on the publicly accessible portions of South Pond in 1988.
This prompted the utility to claim it owned all the land within 15 feet of the shore. Though some landowners had deeds dating back decades, the records for the properties had “turned up missing,” according to the News & Citizen.
After a protracted legal battle, minutes from the South Pond Land Owners Association’s annual meeting in 1990 shows its members voted unanimously to acquire the rights to the pond — and its dam — for $98,500, paid off in installments.
‘Unintended consequences downstream’
For years, it was the responsibility of a designated neighbor to alter the flow of the dam during times of intense rainfall or in danger of flooding and to “exercise” the dam annually. Still, according to Frederick, the dam was “overbuilt” and water has never been close to rising to the height of the dam as it towers 15 feet above the pond’s usual water level.
This hand-operation method was replaced in 2004 by a spillway, a green box that sits in front of the dam and allows the free flow of water through it, allowing the pond to self-regulate. A primary concern of the state remains that the dam tunnel allowing water to pass through it has been unchanged since it was built, and there is no auxiliary spillway except at the top of the dam, where water can flow out and erode the ground encasing the dam.

A spot inspection conducted by the state following the July 2023 floods found the dam to be in good condition and in no danger of failure, though investigators recommended debris be removed from its spillway.
According to Green, who has worked closely with Frederick and the landowners association to address the concerns raised in the 2022 inspection, Vermont has lagged behind the rest of the country in regulating dams, and its authority to regulate privately owned dams has historically been weak, with the state unable to step in unless a failure is imminent.
That’s beginning to change, though efforts to phase in new regulations have been stymied by the distraction of multiple 2023 floods and another last summer requiring more immediate attention. Still, Green praised the South Pond landowners for being proactive and cooperating with the state of their own volition.

Frederick said the cumulative studies recommended by the state should cost between $100,000 and $150,000, a price tag that the association members were unable to afford to pay in a single year of collected dues. The state has allowed the association to pay for the undertaking study by study in annual installments, though this still means that landowners used to paying a few hundred dollars a year are now paying over $1,000 each year for the privilege of living on South Pond.
These studies could potentially lead to an eventual reconfiguration of the dam, Green said, which could in turn allow for the reduction of the dam’s hazard level and a higher condition rating.
The amount of water the dam pushes into the Gihon brings its own considerations. The dam’s spillway, particularly in extreme flooding events, simply releases the water gathering in South Pond into the Gihon, whose flooding contributed to the excessive damage that has reshaped the town of Johnson and other downstream villages. It’s the size of the passage below the dam, unchanged for over 100 years, that will be important to get right if any changes are made.
“Whenever you modify a spillway, you have to be careful in doing so. It might be attractive to release a bunch more water,” Green said. “While that sounds attractive, that can have unintended consequences downstream.”
South Pond is the model for the rest of privately owned dams in the state, Green said, but as the state increases its regulatory scrutiny, what are now recommendations being made by the state may become requirements.
“I think a lot of owners have gotten into a little bit of a groove of not really spending the money necessary, so this is going to be, unfortunately, a little bit shocking for some owners,” Green said.

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)Seven Arkansas families with children in public schools filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday to block the implementation of a new state law requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms.
Northwest Arkansas parents and their minor children who identify as Jewish, Unitarian Universalist, Humanist, agnostic, atheist and nonreligious filed the complaint Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas against the Fayetteville, Springdale, Bentonville and Siloam Springs school districts.
The plaintiffs are asking a judge to declare the law unconstitutional and are seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions to prevent the school districts from complying with the law, according to the complaint.
Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds.
According to the law, posters shall be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions to a local school board, building governing entity or the Building Authority Division. Posters that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.
In a statement, plaintiff Samantha Stinson said that as American Jews, she and her husband “deeply value the ability to raise our children in our faith, without interference from the government.” Fellow plaintiff Carol Vella agreed, noting that her children are among a small number of Jewish students at their school.
“The classroom displays required by Act 573 will make them feel like they don’t belong simply because they don’t follow the government’s favored religion,” she said. “The displays will also violate core Jewish tenets, which emphasize tolerance and inclusion and prohibit evangelizing others.”
The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, the ACLU, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett serving as pro bono counsel, according to a press release.
The complaint alleges Act 573 violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” and its Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].”
“As a result of the Ten Commandments displays mandated by Act 573, Arkansas students—including the minor-child Plaintiffs—will be unconstitutionally coerced into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state’s favored religious scripture, and they will be pressured to suppress their personal religious beliefs and practices, especially in school, to avoid the potential disfavor, reproach, and/or disapproval of school officials and/or their peers,” the complaint states.
By mandating a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments be displayed, “Act 573 adopts an official position on religious matters, violating the Establishment Clause’s prohibition against taking sides in questions over theological doctrine,” according to the complaint.
In a statement, Americans United for Separation of Church and State President and CEO Rachel Laser said the Constitution’s guarantee of the separation of church and state means families, not politicians, decide if and how public school children engage with religion.
“This law is part of the nationwide Christian Nationalist scheme to win favor for one set of religious views over all others and nonreligion — in a country that promises religious freedom. Not on our watch,” Laser said.
Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, and Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs, sponsored Act 573, but the merits of the legislation were largely presented in committee hearings by WallBuilders, a group “emphasizing the moral, Christian, and constitutional foundation on which our nation was built,” according to its website.
Supporters of the measure emphasized the Ten Commandments as a historical document, an argument rejected in Wednesday’s complaint.
“This nation’s core founding documents — the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights — were not based on the Ten Commandments, and there is no longstanding history or tradition of prominently and permanently displaying the Ten Commandments in public-school classrooms,” the complaint states.
The complaint cites longstanding court precedent, including Stone v. Graham, a 1980 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law mandating classroom displays of the Ten Commandments as unconstitutional.
A federal district court ruled last year that a Louisiana law similar to Act 573 violates the First Amendment. Plaintiffs in that case, which is on appeal, are represented by the same counsel as the Arkansas lawsuit, according to the press release.
Plaintiffs in the Arkansas case plan to file a motion for preliminary injunction, which will ask the court to issue an order temporarily preventing implementation of the law, set to take effect Aug. 5, while the lawsuit is pending, according to the release.

Rallies are planned to take place in every U.S. state and more than a dozen countries.
The No Kings protest comes after an explosive week of confrontations among protesters and the National Guard in Los Angeles, sparked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests at a worksite on June 6.
In Connecticut, state police said they were preparing to maintain a safe environment for participants and bystanders and are coordinating closely with local, state and federal partners. 
“As demonstrations and public gatherings are expected throughout Connecticut, we want to reaffirm our commitment to ensuring the safety, rights and well-being of all individuals throughout our state. We recognize and support the constitutional right to peaceful assembly and free expression,” state police said in a statement. “We ask everyone to demonstrate safely, respectfully and lawfully.”
Police urged the public to dial 911 in the event of an emergency.
At the Connecticut state Capitol in Hartford, Capitol Police said that they are anticipating a smooth day.
“For all intents and purposes, we believe this will be a nice, peaceful protest, so people can feel free to come and express their views in a safe environment, and that’s what we strive to provide,” said Lt. Greg Wimble.
Sen. Chris Murphy participated in a preparatory call on Thursday with organizers of the No Kings protest.
“I think it may be that this weekend may go down as a key turning point in our movement to save our democracy, to stop Donald Trump from converting it into some kleptocratic oligarchy,” Murphy said. 
During that call, organizers shared a list of safety practices for participants, including attending with a buddy, choosing an emergency contact, and identifying exits and meeting points. They also recommended writing important phone numbers on an arm or leg with permanent marker in case a cell phone is unavailable or a participant makes the choice to leave it at home. The organizers said that participants should not wear contact lenses in the unlikely event that tear gas or pepper spray is deployed.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/npr.brightspotcdn-5-1024x683.webp,,,2025-06-13 12:58:12.246835

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Longtime Oklahoma teachers will continue earning annual salary increases for an extra 10 years, and their children will qualify for a major state-funded scholarship under new laws the governor signed this week.
Gov. Kevin Stitt approved House Bill 1087 on Tuesday to extend the teacher salary schedule, which grants annual incremental pay raises, up to 35 years. The bill also adds one day to the minimum length of an Oklahoma school year, stretching it to 181 instructional days in public schools.
HB 1727, which Stitt also signed Tuesday, opens the Oklahoma’s Promise college scholarship to the children of classroom teachers with at least 10 years of experience. Oklahoma’s Promise pays an amount equal to full resident tuition at a public college or university.
The state’s largest teacher union, the Oklahoma Education Association, celebrated both bills as ways to retain veteran educators. 
Offering scholarship funds to educators’ children is a “powerful step for Oklahoma valuing its teachers and their households,” OEA President Cari Elledge said.

“By granting Oklahoma’s Promise Scholarship to children of certified educators with at least a decade of service, this bill eases the college burden on our families while incentivizing long-term commitment to our schools,” Elledge, a former Norman teacher, said. “OEA championed this from committee rooms to the governor’s desk because addressing the educator shortage requires meaningful investment.”
The governor also signed a bill offering grants to school districts that are trying to boost the pipeline of new teachers. 
Senate Bill 235 offers matching funds to districts that have established Grow Your Own Educator programs, which give undergraduate college tuition assistance or loan repayment to aspiring teachers.
The bill’s author, Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said lawmakers set aside $5 million for these grants. 
Pugh, who leads the Senate Education Committee, said the slate of school-focused bills the Legislature passed this year are “building a stronger foundation for Oklahoma’s future.”
“Each of these measures reflects our commitment to supporting students, empowering teachers and ensuring every child in our state has access to a high-quality education,” Pugh said in a statement.
Multiple bills emphasizing math also passed.

Stitt approved HB 1287, giving $3 million to the University of Oklahoma for a math tutoring program assisting the lowest-performing ninth graders. Qualifying students must attend a school district with enrollment of at least 30,000 or a public charter school.
The governor also signed on Tuesday the Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency Act, also known as SB 140. It’s expected to cost $1 million, according to a fiscal impact estimate from legislative staff.
The new law requires public schools to screen students’ math proficiency three times a year in grades 2-5. Schools must create a math intervention plan for children who score below their grade level and could receive extra funds dedicated for these students. Struggling students also must be screened for dyscalculia, a learning disability affecting comprehension of arithmetic.
Those who screen above their grade level in math must be offered advanced learning opportunities.
“Senate Bill 140 is a critical step forward in improving math outcomes across our state,” the bill’s author, Sen. Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, said. “By identifying students who need additional help or more advanced instruction, they will now have personalized support to ensure every child can succeed.”

(Provided by Emily Wiles)ANDERSON — South Carolina plans to rebuild or repair an estimated 900 homes damaged by Hurricane Helene.
A state Office of Resilience plan lays out spending for nearly $200 million in federal and state funding set aside in the wake of the massive storm, which swept across the Southeast last September.
Helene marked the deadliest storm in state history, leading to the deaths of 49 people and bringing tropical storm-force winds and heavy rainfall across most of western and central South Carolina.
The 49 people in SC killed by the deadliest storm in state history

To aid in recovery, the Palmetto State will spend more than 80% of the $150 million it received from U.S. Housing and Urban Development on housing.
The lionshare — $110.7 million — will go to repairing and replacing homes, said Disaster Recovery Director Scott Sharpe.
HUD requires the state to spend most, if not all, the federal funds in what it considers the heaviest-hit counties: Greenville, Abbeville, McCormick, Edgefield and Orangeburg.
No more than 20% is allowed to go to residents of Aiken, Saluda, Greenwood, Laurens, Union, Spartanburg, Cherokee, Anderson, Oconnee and Pickens.
Legislators also approved $40 million in the upcoming budget to replenish one of the state’s own disaster recovery funds, a portion of which the Resilience Office will use to rebuild homes in impacted counties not eligible for federal dollars.
The state is focusing rebuilding efforts on those families with the greatest financial need, starting with families earning just 30% of the area median income and further prioritizing those with children and elderly or disabled family members, Sharpe said.
In Greenville County, that’s less than $29,000 for a family of four. In Orangeburg County, it’s an income less than $20,400, according to HUD figures.
A series of disasters taught SC how to work with FEMA. Leaders encourage reform, not ending it.

The state will spend up to $225,000 to rebuild a home and up to $75,000 to make repairs not covered by insurance or other financial aid, Sharpe said.
The goal is to make those rebuilt homes more storm resistant. They’ll have reinforced roofs and windows resistant to hurricane-force winds. The state also will elevate those in flood plains, Sharpe said.
When it comes to mobile homes, if the homeowner owns the land, the state will replace them with standard, single family homes. If the homeowner leases the lot their mobile home sits on, the state will replace it with a new mobile home.
Once it receives federal approval, the Resilience Office will begin taking applications for federal aid, likely in late August.
The state dollars can be spent sooner, Sharpe said. State recovery officials, known as disaster case managers, have already been gathering a list of eligible homeowners and Sharpe hopes to begin rebuilds on as many as 200 homes in the next few weeks.
Beyond repairs, the state is setting aside $13 million to buy out repeatedly flooded homes.
Want to aid SC recovery efforts? One SC Fund re-activated to collect and distribute donations

And $7.5 million will go to repair rental properties for landlords who agree to keep the rent at an affordable level as set by HUD for at least five years.
Sharpe said Helene heavily impacted renters. Tenants made up roughly 40% of aid applications filed with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Finally, the state is turning to volunteer organizations to help with repairs and stretch the recovery dollars further. Those volunteer groups are often nonprofits that pay for repairs through their own fundraising. They’re also eligible for money from the One SC Fund.
The fund was created in 2015 with the backing of then-Gov. Nikki Haley to respond to historic flooding after Hurricane Joaquin stalled off the coast and dumped up to 2 feet of rain on parts of South Carolina. The Central Carolina Community Foundation, which manages the fund, reactivated it in response to Hurricane Matthew in 2016, Hurricane Florence in 2018, the COVID pandemic, and most recently, Hurricane Helene.

Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Another Idaho hospital announces it can no longer deliver babies

Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
 Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals in the United States still have labor and delivery services

Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
Three rural labor and delivery departments in Idaho have closed since 2020, according to the report. That represents 16% of rural hospitals in the Gem State. In 2025, 14 of Idaho’s rural hospitals don’t have labor and delivery services, and the median driving time to get to those hospitals that do is 39 minutes in Idaho, according to the center’s report.
There are 16 rural hospitals in Idaho that still offer labor and delivery services, representing 53% of all rural hospitals statewide. But four of those rural hospitals are at risk of closing, according to the report.
“A labor and delivery unit is counted as ‘at risk of closing’ if the hospital lost money on all patient services (not just labor and delivery services) in both of the two most recent years available and also had a negative total margin in both years,” the report states.
  (Map courtesy of Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform)
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.

 Births in the U.S. are expensive, especially in rural areas

The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.













 You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services.


– Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform





“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
Idaho’s OB-GYN exodus throws women in rural towns into a care void

For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.

 Ripple effects on ambulance, drive times

Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
 State action and Medicaid cuts

Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
Idaho doctor who worked at closed maternity ward says abortion ban harmed recruiting

As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

Casper issued a preliminary injunction stopping the order from going into effect while the case is pending.“There is no dispute (nor could there be) that U.S. citizenship is required to vote in federal elections and the federal voter registration forms require attestation of citizenship,” Casper wrote in her order.“The issue here is whether the President can require documentary proof of citizenship where the authority for election requirements is in the hands of Congress, its statutes … do not require it, and the statutorily created (Election Assistance Commission) is required to go through a notice and comment period and consult with the States before implementing any changes to the federal forms for voter registration,” Casper, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, continued.Democratic attorneys general in 19 states brought the suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts after the president signed the order in March.The order directed the federal Election Assistance Commission, which distributes grants to states, within 30 days to start requiring people registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or state-issued identification that indicates citizenship.Harm to votersIn her decision to grant the preliminary injunction, Casper said the states had shown that without a pause on the executive order, “citizens will be disenfranchised.”“The States have also credibly attested that the challenged requirements could create chaos and confusion that could result in voters losing trust in the election process,” she said.The executive order posed risks of irreparable harm to states “for at least three reasons,” Casper wrote.She noted the cost and resources to implement the executive order, the federal funding states are at risk of losing if they do not comply with the order and discouraging voter participation.Chilling voter participation is “the antithesis of Congress’s purpose in enacting the (The Uniform Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act) and the (National Voter Registration Act),” she wrote.The order also would prohibit the counting of absentee or mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day. States set their own rules for ballot counting and many allow those that arrive after Election Day but postmarked before.The states that brought the challenge to the executive order are: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.Crackdown on immigrantsThe executive order that Trump signed in March was a culmination of his rhetoric on the campaign trail about people without U.S. citizenship voting in federal elections and his vow to crackdown on immigration and carry out mass deportations.Republicans have sought to use the rare examples of people without citizenship voting in federal elections, and local governments that allow immigrants to vote in local elections, to tighten restrictions on voter registration.U.S. House Republicans in April passed a bill to codify the executive order.The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, conducted an analysis of election conduct from 2003 to 2023 and found 29 instances of noncitizens voting, just more than one per year.",,,,2025-06-13 12:58:12.246835

The 67-bed hospital, now called UMMC Madison, will provide a wide range of community hospital services, including emergency services, medical-surgical care, intensive care, cardiology, neurology, general surgery and radiology services. It also will serve as a training site for medical students, and it plans to offer OB-GYN care in the future. 
“As Mississippi’s only academic medical center, we must continue to be focused on our three-part mission to educate the next generation of health care providers, conduct impactful research and deliver accessible high-quality health care,” Dr. LouAnn Woodward, UMMC’s vice chancellor of health affairs, said in a statement. “Every decision we make is rooted in our mission.” 
The new facility will help address space constraints at the medical center’s main campus in Jackson by freeing up hospital beds, imaging services and operating areas, said Dr. Alan Jones, associate vice chancellor for health affairs. 
UMMC physicians have performed surgeries and other procedures at the hospital in Madison since 2019. UMMC became the full owner of the hospital May 1 after purchasing it from Franklin, Tennessee-based Community Health Systems. 
The Batson Kids Clinic, which offers pediatric primary care, will move to the former Mississippi Center for Advanced Medicine location in Madison. This space will allow the medical center to offer pediatric primary care and specialty services and resolve space issues that prevent the clinic from adding new providers, according to Institutions of Higher Learning board minutes.
A UMMC spokesperson did not respond to questions about the services that will be offered at the clinic or when it will begin accepting patients.
The Mississippi Center for Advanced Medicine, a pediatric subspecialty clinic, closed last year as a result of a settlement in a seven-year legal battle between the clinic and UMMC in a federal trade secrets lawsuit. 
The changes come after the opening of UMMC’s Colony Park South clinic in Ridgeland in February. The clinic offers a range of specialty outpatient services, including surgical services. Another Ridgeland UMMC clinic, Colony Park North, will open in 2026.
The expansion of UMMC clinical services to Madison County has been criticized by state lawmakers and Jackson city leaders. The medical center does not need state approval to open new educational facilities. Critics say UMMC has used this exemption to locate facilities in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods outside Jackson while reducing services in the city. 
UMMC did not respond to a request for comment about its movement of services to Madison County. 
UMMC began removing clinical services this year from Jackson Medical Mall, which is in a majority-Black neighborhood with a high poverty rate. The medical center plans to reduce its square footage at the mall by about 75% in the next year. 
The movement of health care services from Jackson to the suburbs is a “very troubling trend” that will make it more difficult for Jackson residents to access care, Democratic state Sen. John Horhn, who will become Jackson’s mayor July 1, previously told Mississippi Today. 
Lawmakers sought to rein in UMMC’s expansion outside Jackson this year by passing a bill that would require the medical center to receive state approval before opening new educational medical facilities in areas other than the vicinity of its main campus and Jackson Medical Mall.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia — a Salvadoran native who was wrongfully deported to an El Salvador prison as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown — shared a message from him with a crowd gathered at a downtown Nashville church ahead of his arraignment Friday morning:
“Continue fighting, and I will be victorious because God is with us.”
About two blocks down the street, Abrego Garcia awaited his arraignment in federal court on criminal “alien smuggling” charges and a hearing to determine whether he will continue to be detained until trial.
Speaking to a crowd of immigrant rights advocates, union leaders and clergy, Jennifer Vasquez Sura said Thursday marked exactly three months since “the administration abducted and disappeared my husband and separated him from our family.”
It also marked the first time she was able to see him — albeit through a video screen.
Hundreds of miles away, their son, Kilmar Jr., was in Maryland at his kindergarten graduation, she said.

“Our family should have never been in this situation,” she said, her voice choking with emotion. “We should be with our children. Me and Kilmar’s mind is here in Tennessee, but my heart is in Maryland with my kids … My son is alone on his big day, and I’m here fighting for my husband, for his dad, to come back home.”
Abrego Garcia — a 29-year-old Salvadoran native living in Maryland, union sheet metal worker and father of three — was driving home with his five-year-old son when he was pulled over in March. He was detained and mistakenly deported to a notorious Salvadoran prison under allegations of membership in the MS-13 criminal gang. His family says they are false. A court order from 2019 expressly prohibited his deportation to El Salvador, where he fears persecution.
The El Salvador government returned Abrego Garcia to the United States in June to face a grand jury indictment in Tennessee for one count of “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and one count of “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain” between 2016 and 2025.
The indictment was issued May 21 but remained sealed until June 6.
The charges are tied to a traffic stop by the Tennessee Highway Patrol in November 2022, when Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding about 80 miles east of Nashville while driving an SUV with nine Hispanic men. No charges were filed at the time, but prosecutors now allege that the stop involved smuggling migrants within the United States.
Vasquez Sura said Abrego Garcia spoke of faith and gratitude.
“To everyone who continues to support Kilmar and the fight for justice, Kilmar says, ‘Thank you from the bottom of my heart. God has put us in this path together for a reason. He knows why He does it and what He does, and there’s always a reason we have all come together at this moment,” Vasquez Sura said.
“Kilmar shares that he feels God’s presence with him, as only God knows the darkness he has faced in these past three months,” she said.

(Laura Chramer for Alabama Reflector)A group of at least 14 protests under the banner “No Kings” are planned for Saturday in Alabama.
The demonstrations are part of nationwide effort that organizers say aim to reject President Donald Trump’s “made-for-TV” show of force coinciding with his birthday and Flag Day, a date chosen by organizers to reclaim the symbol of the American flag.
“Real power isn’t staged in Washington. It rises up everywhere else,” organizers stated on the website. “The flag doesn’t belong to President Trump. It belongs to us.”
The nationwide “Hands Off” protests drew thousands of people in early April to several cities around the state, including Montgomery, Birmingham and Tuscaloosa. The protests focused on concerns about the administration’s efforts to deport immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and attacks on federal agencies. Protestors pointed to concerns about federal workforce reductions and attacks on the LGBTQ+ community, particularly transgender individuals.
Protests Saturday are scheduled from Florence and Huntsville in the northern part of the state to Dothan and Mobile in the south.
The following protests are planned at various times throughout Saturday.

This article was originally published by Votebeat, a nonprofit news organization covering local election administration and voting access.
After years of fruitless debate in Pennsylvania’s legislature about whether and how to update the commonwealth’s election laws, a civics project is trying to see whether ordinary voters have better luck reaching a consensus on issues such as early voting and voter ID.
Nearly 200 Pennsylvanians gave it a shot last weekend in an effort organized by Stanford University’s Deliberative Democracy Lab and Helena, a nonprofit that describes itself as a “global problem solving organization.”
The discussions among the participants, gathered in small groups at a Sheraton Hotel in Philadelphia, spotlighted the way ordinary voters process the issues that fuel political rhetoric, legislative debates, and court battles.
In one exchange, William Sontag, a participant from Chester County, said he was “baffled” about what the argument against new voter ID requirements might be.
Sarah Dewey, from Bucks County, told him about a friend who had been homeless for a time, with no identification. Dewey said she wasn’t necessarily against voter ID, but worried that the cost of obtaining it could be prohibitive.
After about 15 minutes of discussion, the group coalesced around the idea that requiring an ID to vote would be acceptable, so long as there were no barriers to getting one. They also decided to ask an expert panel later that day whether the cost of getting an ID could be considered a poll tax.
Assessing the will of the people through a ‘deliberative poll’
Sontag, Dewey, and the rest of the participants got involved in the project after the organizers randomly selected them from across Pennsylvania, using a method meant to proportionally represent the state’s geographic regions, as well as demographic and political characteristics, such as age, race, education, and political leaning. Participants were paid for their time.
Focusing on a single state’s policies was a novel approach for the American in One Room project, a collaborative effort between the Deliberative Democracy Lab and Helena which have organized four similar nationally focused events since 2019.
This type of event is called a “deliberative poll.” Participants are provided with relevant information on the issues and access to policy experts. They also take a survey meant to gauge their opinions both before and after the event, to see how the deliberation affected their policy preferences. A control group of residents who aren’t participating in the deliberations also take the poll as a basis for comparison.
The idea is to “get a better assessment of the will of the people,” said James Fishkin, a communications and political science professor at Stanford and director of the Deliberative Democracy Lab.
Besides elections, participants in the Pennsylvania event talked about healthcare, immigration, and housing, among other topics. Many of the election topics mirrored proposals currently being debated in Harrisburg as part of an omnibus voting reform package sponsored by state House Speaker Joanna McClinton, a Philadelphia Democrat, who answered participants’ questions on election issues on the third day.
Fishkin said deliberative polling can prompt policy changes, as it did during consideration of constitutional changes in Mongolia in 2019 — a process that Stanford was also involved with. Deliberative polling also played a role in energy policy debates in Texas, after the Legislature there ordered it as part of its planning process.
A Helena representative said McClinton will use the results of its Pennsylvania poll to inform her priorities in ongoing negotiations with the state Senate over sweeping election legislation that passed the state House last month.
Weighing difficult policy questions, tradeoffs
Participants wrestled with a list of thorny election policy questions, including whether to install video cameras to monitor ballot drop boxes; audit a random sample of ballots to check the accuracy of election results; implement in-person early voting; allow counties to begin processing mail ballots ahead of Election Day; create criminal penalties for misleading, deceiving, or intimidating voters; preregister voters at age 16; and require photo identification to vote.
Many of those policies are part of McClinton’s election bill, which organizers said they used to select the topics for discussion.
In the group discussion observed by Votebeat and Spotlight PA, participants reached agreement on many of the questions posed to them, but it’s hard to know if they had all the information.
For instance, participants were assigned to consider whether Pennsylvania should allow 11 days of early voting, as McClinton’s bill proposes. The briefing document listed increased accessibility as an argument for the proposal, and increased cost as an argument against, among other pros and cons.
One factor they didn’t consider: that the state’s current version of quasi-early voting — in which voters can apply for, complete, and return a mail ballot in person at an elections office — has prompted long lines and confusion. Pennsylvania election officials said they expect that to be an issue for them and for voters in the 2026 and 2028 federal elections.
Instead, the participants in that group looked at early voting only from a redundancy standpoint.
“If mail-in ballots remain, then I don’t see a need for this,” Dewey, from Bucks County, said.
Others in the room agreed with her. Roy Bell, a poll worker from Delaware County, cited the cost of adding personnel for early voting, and election officials’ difficulties in enough poll workers.
Errors in the briefing materials
In addition, the briefing materials provided to participants were not entirely accurate.
For example, the section on pre-canvassing mail ballots said Pennsylvania “currently permits election officials to begin processing mail-in and absentee ballots ahead of time but restricts how early this can start.” Pennsylvania’s election code does not allow any pre-canvassing — the technical term for this process — of mail ballots before Election Day.
It also said that an argument against allowing pre-canvassing is that it “could increase wait times before results.” It’s actually the opposite: Election officials say allowing pre-canvassing would speed up results.
Other portions of the briefing were accurate but incomplete, such as a section on post-election audits that did not mention that Pennsylvania already requires two such audits. Some of the citations in the report also included broken links.
Votebeat and Spotlight PA used GPTzero, a tool that detects whether text is generated using artificial intelligence, to see whether any of the election portions of the briefing had been written by AI. The tool found that for many of the sections on election issues between 80% and 100% of the text was AI-generated.
WITF, an NPR affiliate in Harrisburg, also found errors in other areas of the document.
A spokesperson for the Deliberative Democracy Lab said the briefing materials were developed by research assistants and incorporated materials from previous events. An advisory committee — only one member of which was from Pennsylvania — reviewed the materials, and AI was used to help address recommendations and simplify the language to “an 8th-grade reading level, reflecting the average level of a US adult,” the spokesperson said in an email response to questions.
Some information, including the currently required audits, was excluded so as not to overwhelm the participants, the spokesperson said.
Organizers said they were confident in the integrity of the deliberations, and would note any errors in their final results. Due to the error in the pre-canvassing pros and cons list flagged by Votebeat and Spotlight PA, the Deliberative Democracy Lab said data from that proposal would be excluded.
“These errors appear to have been introduced during an editing and review process of human-created material in which some AI tools were used to assist,” Fishkin said.
“We apologize for these errors and are reviewing our processes to ensure that such issues do not occur in the future,” Fishkin said. “We are, however, confident that in totality, the materials provided to participants were reliable and allowed for a fact-based civil dialogue, which is at the heart of the Deliberative Polling process.”

(Photo by Akchamczuk/Getty Images)A key lawmaker said he was surprised by Gov. Kim Reynolds’ veto this week of a bill that would have allowed for the prescription and distribution of synthetic psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in “magic mushrooms” following federal approval of the drug. 
Reynolds said the bill “moves ahead” of public health systems, law enforcement and regulatory systems in the state. 
“This decision is not a dismissal of the emerging science or the sincere advocacy behind this legislation,” Reynolds said in her explanation of the veto. “Rather, it is a call for a more deliberate and Iowa-centric approach.” 
House File 383 was one of two bills from the Iowa House this year that sought to legalize the use of psychedelics as a treatment for mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. 
The bill’s floor manager, Rep. Brett Barker, R-Nevada, said the veto from the governor was “unexpected” considering the bill passed with unanimous consent in both chambers.
“I look forward to having a conversation with the Governor to learn more about her concerns regarding the bill,” Barker said in an email.

The other bill, House File 978, would have created a psilocybin licensing board in Iowa, and similar to the state’s medical marijuana program, would have allowed eligible patients access to the drug while it is still federally classified as Schedule I substance. 
The bill advanced from the House but was not heard in the Senate.
HF 383, the bill put before the governor, would have immediately rescheduled any drugs containing crystalline polymorph psilocybin, the synthetic version of the compound, if they were approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
Under the bill and conditioned circumstances, it would be legal to prescribe, distribute and market drugs with the ingredient, which is also sometimes referred to as COMP360. 
Clinical trials of COMP360 as a treatment for PTSD and treatment resistant depression have been conducted and are ongoing. 
A similar bill was signed into law in Colorado in March. Colorado and Oregon are the only states with legalized medical licensing programs for psilocybin. 
Reynolds said she does “recognize and respect the growing body of research into the potential therapeutic benefits of psilocybin” but she said the compound should be approved by FDA and the Drug Enforcement Agency before Iowa acts to reschedule. 
“The pathway provided by this bill for legalization of psilocybin at the state level before we have a chance to review federal action … creates legal uncertainty, poses risks for misuse and could undermine broader efforts to ensure safe and effective therapeutic use in the future,” Reynolds said.

The House had initially planned to slash operational funding for each institution across the board in House Bill 4580, sponsored by state Rep. Greg Markkanen (R-Hancock). 
That would have resulted in a $828.1 million decrease in overall operational funding. Meanwhile, the House also planned to cut state funding to Michigan State University and University of Michigan in Ann Arbor to penalize them for not producing enough Michigan-based graduates. The House noted that operational cuts to those universities were due in part to their large endowments, cutting 50% of funding from MSU and up to 75% of funding from U of M.
Another big factor in the House Appropriations Committee-produced university budget bill, which was sent to the floor on Wednesday, was its boilerplate language indicating the different ways it would penalize universities for “woke” policies. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The House planned to withhold funding if universities allowed transgender women to play women’s sports, created common area spaces or held gatherings that separated people by sex or race, or continued to push diversity, equity and inclusion-based programming or initiatives.
What passed the entire chamber – albeit along party lines – was a much different funding model. The $828.1 million operational funding cut was out and replaced with a $51.6 million decrease, meanwhile still cutting the same amount of general fund dollars from university operational funding at $1.2 billion.
That softened the blow a bit for other universities but MSU and U of M still took a hit in the House-passed version. Instead of taking a percentage of state funding away from those flagship state universities, the House made a $291 million reduction in operational funding across the board just for those two universities. MSU’s state funding was to be reduced by $56.6 million, or an 18% reduction, and U of M’s state funding was to be reduced by $234.4 million, a 65% reduction.
What happens to the savings? 
The House-passed plan redistributes that to the other 13 state universities, with $22 million of those general fund dollars going to the state’s tuition grant program, $13.3 million for Native American tuition waiver payments and a $13 million payment to the seven universities that participate in the Michigan Public School Employee Retirement System.
The DEI and women’s sports boilerplate language remained, however, as did the House’s plan to shift a significant portion of school aid fund dollars for public schools to higher education.
Also passing late Thursday evening was the community college budget, House Bill 4579, which the chamber moved unchanged from its committee reported version. Community colleges in the House budget would receive $456.6 million with zero general fund dollars, resulting in a decrease of $5.56 million, or 1.2%.
The House on Wednesday passed House Bill 4576, funding the Department of Education, public schools, and House Bill 4577, funding Michigan’s K-12 public schools, and House Bill 4578, funding the Michigan Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement and Potential.
The K-12 budget passed Wednesday was also rife with boilerplate language that would target DEI programs and initiatives and wrapped school meals and other vital student success programs into per-pupil funding. Democrats argue costs for those services – like funding for at-risk students – would come out of classroom dollars that students and teachers need.
What’s next?
The road ahead at the bargaining table between the Democratic-controlled state Senate and Gov. Grecthen Whitmer could be difficult to predict, considering the dynamics in play with divided government and the fact that Whitmer and state House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) have been talking about budget items and road funding for the last several months, said Andrea Bitely, founder of Bitely Communications.
Bitley in an interview with Michigan Advance said that both Hall and Whitmer hold each other’s political fates in the palm of their hands.
“Hall holds Whitmer’s fate when it comes to what her final success story is,” Bitley said. “She started off with a really bumpy ride. Her numbers for the first few years were not great, and the pandemic shifted that. Now she’s one of America’s most well-known and popular governors. But she wants to end on a high note.”
Whatever her next moves, Hall and House Appropriations Chair Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton) are coming to the negotiating table this year with a wholly different way to fund public schools, a reduced university funding model and with several political pressure points in the culture war-tinted boilerplate language.
“He’s coming to the table with something that’s not ideal for her, or a lot of the interest groups that she works closely with that are her prime supporters,” Bitely said. “There are a lot of stakeholders that are mad [about the House education budgets].”
What the differing plans offer between the Senate, the House and the executive office recommendations is a chance to have a true negotiation, Bitely added.
“This is honestly giving everybody the opportunity to come to the negotiating table and work this out,” she said. “There are going to be true negotiations because everyone wants something in this budget. Whitmer wants more roads money, she wants education money. Hall also wants roads money, but wants it in a different way than she does. But he also wants education money.”
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) was much harder to predict.
“She’s been the outlier in everything over the past 100 days or so,” Bitley said. “She’s kind of the wild card because Whitmer and Hall have obviously been working together for a multitude of reasons. They are the ultimate frenemies. And we know that Matt Hall right now is working better with Whitmer and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan than Winnie Brinks or [Democratic minority House leader and state Rep. Ranjeev Puri of Canton]. That’s where we’re at in Michigan’s political world.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-13-at-11.41.03 AM-e1749829425706-1024x554.png,,,2025-06-13 11:57:58.047857

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)An initial deadline has passed for the Trump administration to appeal to a federal judge why a Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian activist should be kept at a detention center in Central Louisiana.
Lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil say that means he should be released immediately. He has been held at the LaSalle Detention Center in Jena since his March 8 apprehension by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at his dormitory on the New York City campus.
Khalil has approved legal status to live and attend school in the United States, and federal officials have yet to charge him with a crime. He’s among several foreign nationals the Trump administration has seized and detained, citing the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The legislation allows immigrants to be deported if the secretary of state feels their pose a risk to foreign relations.
U..S. District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz of New Jersey had given the Trump administration until 8:30 a.m. Central today to respond to and order he issued Wednesday for Khalil’s release.
Farbiarz, a federal court appointee of former President Joe Biden, has moved that deadline until 12:30 p.m., according to Khalil’s lawyers.
“Anything further is an attempt to prolong his unconstitutional, arbitrary, and cruel detention,” Khalil’s legal team said in a statement issued Friday morning.
Khalil’s case originated in Farbiarz’s New Jersey court because he was first placed in an ICE detention facility there. He was moved to the Louisiana, as have many detainees, where immigration advocates have said the federal court landscape is more friendly to the Trump administration’s deportation objectives.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia — a Salvadoran native who was wrongfully deported to an El Salvador prison as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown — shared a message from him with a crowd gathered at a downtown Nashville church ahead of his arraignment Friday morning:
“Continue fighting, and I will be victorious because God is with us.”
About two blocks down the street, Abrego Garcia awaited his arraignment in federal court on criminal “alien smuggling” charges and a hearing to determine whether he will continue to be detained until trial. 
Speaking to a crowd of immigrant rights advocates, union leaders and clergy, Jennifer Vasquez Sura said Thursday marked exactly three months since “the administration abducted and disappeared my husband and separated him from our family.” 
It also marked the first time she was able to see him — albeit through a video screen. 
Hundreds of miles away, their son, Kilmar Jr., was in Maryland at his kindergarten graduation, she said.

“Our family should have never been in this situation,” she said, her voice choking with emotion. “We should be with our children. Me and Kilmar’s mind is here in Tennessee, but my heart is in Maryland with my kids … My son is alone on his big day, and I’m here fighting for my husband, for his dad, to come back home.”
Abrego Garcia — a 29-year-old Salvadoran native living in Maryland, union sheet metal worker and father of three — was driving home with his five-year-old son when he was pulled over in March. He was detained and mistakenly deported to a notorious Salvadoran prison under allegations of membership in the MS-13 criminal gang. His family says they are false. A court order from 2019 expressly prohibited his deportation to El Salvador, where he fears persecution.
The El Salvador government returned Abrego Garcia to the United States in June to face a grand jury indictment in Tennessee for one count of “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and one count of “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain” between 2016 and 2025.
The indictment was issued May 21 but remained sealed until June 6.
The charges are tied to a traffic stop by the Tennessee Highway Patrol in November 2022, when Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding about 80 miles east of Nashville while driving an SUV with nine Hispanic men. No charges were filed at the time, but prosecutors now allege that the stop involved smuggling migrants within the United States.
Vasquez Sura said Abrego Garcia spoke of faith and gratitude.
“To everyone who continues to support Kilmar and the fight for justice, Kilmar says, ‘Thank you from the bottom of my heart. God has put us in this path together for a reason. He knows why He does it and what He does, and there’s always a reason we have all come together at this moment,” Vasquez Sura said.
“Kilmar shares that he feels God’s presence with him, as only God knows the darkness he has faced in these past three months,” she said.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein signed a bundle of bills into law Friday, including one that overhauls how the state’s investments are managed.
Under House Bill 506, a five-person board of appointees would oversee North Carolina’s $127 billion pension fund. It is currently the sole responsibility of the treasurer. The new law comes after Brad Briner, the new Republican treasurer, said he wanted to see the fund deliver better returns for state retirees.
“While I trust that Treasurer Briner would do an excellent job if he kept this authority to himself, he and I share a belief that this process will be stronger when more voices are involved,” Stein said Friday at a bill signing ceremony in the governor’s mansion.
Briner’s predecessor, former Republican Treasurer Dale Folwell, was often criticized for keeping an unusually large portion of the state pension funds sitting in cash. Briner pledged to move North Carolina away from that sole-fiduciary governance model.
Briner, who also spoke Friday, said the state had “fallen short on the investment side,” which was “coming at a cost to our retirees.”
“This legislation allows us to face that problem,” he said.
Four of the five members of the new board will be appointees. Two will be appointed by the heads of the House and Senate, both Republicans. Stein and Briner will both appoint one member each, subject to the legislature’s approval. Those members will serve staggered six-year terms; they must have expert knowledge and a decade of relevant experience.
Stein also signed several other bills into law Friday:

House Bill 50, which changes how state law enforcement officers’ separation allowance is paid out.
House Bill 231, which makes it easier for social workers to transfer their licenses to North Carolina.
House Bill 477, which makes changes to the Death Benefits Plan in state retirement plans.
Senate Bill 248, which makes birth certificates for adopted persons similar to those not adopted.
Senate Bill 477, which makes changes to the Department of Natural Resources, including about public access to confidential information on rare species and sensitive habitats.

Stein has yet to issue a veto, but that could change soon. Several controversial Republican-led bills sit on the Democrat’s desk, including multiple proposals to crack down on immigration enforcement, and a bill allowing permit-less carry of handguns.
The governor has ten days to either sign or veto a bill before it automatically becomes law. If Stein does issue vetoes, the path for a GOP override could be challenging — Republicans are one vote short of a veto-proof majority in the House.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2158-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 11:57:58.047857

(Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)Kaiya Brown was at work last week when she started getting the texts. Her friends were asking if she’d seen the news: The Trump administration wants to cut funding for tribal colleges by nearly 90%.
Brown (Diné) is in her first year at Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in northwest Albuquerque, one of 37 tribal colleges and universities in the country and four in New Mexico, many of which offer free tuition to tribal citizens.
If Congress approves the administration’s budget request released last Monday, funding for the schools will drop from over $183 million to about $22 million in the next fiscal year, starting in October. Federal funding makes up 74% of total revenue for tribal colleges and universities, ICT reported in January.



				This story was originally published by New Mexico In Depth.			


“It’s really scary,” Brown said. “I don’t think enough people understand the importance of tribal colleges and what they do for our communities. They provide opportunities that many students would have never had. It makes me really emotional, honestly, because they don’t understand how this would impact so many lives.”
Brown is studying early childhood education with hopes of going into social work to advocate for Native children.

Part of why she chose a tribal college was because she didn’t feel safe or supported at her Rio Rancho high school. In one instance, Brown wore her regalia, including moccasins and jewelry, to school, and a teacher asked, “Where’s your feathers?” Another time, she and a couple other Native students were carrying frybread for a sale, and a group of their peers started mocking them. One of the students told them, “I thought we killed all your people.”
Her experience so far at college, Brown said, couldn’t be more different.
“We’re all so close to one another. We all want to see each other succeed,” she said. “And I truly feel that from the staff and from my instructors. These are Native instructors, people that look like me and know my ways.”
She’s also enjoyed the small class sizes. Last fall, 215 students were enrolled, according to data from the college, which was founded in 1971. The largest class Brown is in right now has five students total. Instead of getting lost in a lecture hall with a hundred other people, she’s able to get more hands-on help from instructors.
But the mood on campus hasn’t been the same lately, Brown said. The community has been reeling from a round of layoffs earlier this year.
The institute, along with Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas, is federally operated. In February, the Bureau of Indian Education laid off dozens of faculty and staff members at the two institutions in response to Trump’s directives to reduce the federal workforce. Many classes were left without instructors, and a power outage in Brown’s dorm lasted 13 hours because there weren’t enough maintenance workers available to fix it. A few weeks later, some employees were re-hired, but it was unclear whether the hirings were permanent or temporary.
That’s according to a lawsuit against the federal government brought by the Native American Rights Fund in March. Brown is a plaintiff, along with four Haskell students and three tribal nations, including Isleta Pueblo.
“Tribal nations and the federal government should be working together to best serve our Native students,” Isleta Pueblo Gov. Eugene Jiron said in a statement. “Instead, the administration is randomly, without preparation and in violation of their federal trust responsibility, taking away teachers and staff from already-underserved facilities. Our students deserve better.”

  In fall 2024, about 62% of the 215 students enrolled were citizens of the Navajo Nation, according to data available on the college’s website. (Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)


The layoffs worsened problems caused by chronic understaffing at the schools, the lawsuit argues. Congress has underfunded tribal colleges by $250 million a year, ProPublica reported in 2024.
The re-hirings brought some relief, Brown said, but the proposed cuts have stirred up fear among students and employees again.
“These schools have done so much for our people,” she said. “So many passionate people and talented artists have come from these schools. They give us the tools to pursue our dreams. It’s like our stepping stone into the world. And taking that away will be devastating to a lot of students, including myself.”
New Mexico is home to three other tribal colleges: Diné College, which has campuses in Shiprock and Crownpoint, as well as in Arizona; the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe; and Navajo Technical University, with a main campus in Crownpoint. In fall 2024, an estimated 3,378 students were enrolled at the schools, according to the state Higher Education Department.
In a statement last week, Robert Martin, president of the Institute of American Indian Arts, said, “I know that we will prevail in the end, but we can’t take that for granted. We have strong Congressional support but they need to hear from all of our constituents.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kayabrown-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-06-13 11:57:58.047857

Apartments.With much fanfare, EMPOWERment Inc., held a ribbon-cutting in April for P.E.A.C.H Apartments, a 10-unit affordable housing complex it developed for low-income residents unable to pay Chapel Hill’s high rents.
At the ribbon cutting, U.S. Rep. Valerie Foushee (D-NC) and other dignitaries praised the nonprofit for its vision and persistence in addressing a critical need for safe and affordable housing in the town that is home to UNC Chapel Hill, the flagship university of the state’s 17-campus UNC System.
Families were supposed to begin moving into apartments for tenants earning at or below 30% of Area Median Income (AMI) the following month but it never happened. The anticipated move-ins were short circuited because Duke Energy Progress refused to run power to the apartments, citing the developer’s decision to use a single meter for billing purposes, according to a consumer complaint EMPOWERment Inc., filed against the energy company with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.
  Delores Bailey (Photo: EMPOWERment Inc.)
“We’ve tried to resolve this conflict, but we have no choice other than file this complaint so our tenants can have affordable housing,” said Delores Bailey, executive director of EMPOWERment INC. “Our building is at risk and 10 families in our community are struggling with housing when they shouldn’t have to be.”
According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 30% AMI for the Durham-Chapel Hill HUD Metro Fair Market Rent Area is $22,250 for a family of one, $25,400 for a family of two, $28,600 for a family of three and $31,750 for a family of four.
Bailey said EMPOWERment Inc., decided to use one meter for the entire apartment complex to accommodate rooftop solar panels installed to reduce energy costs for low-income residents who would rent the apartments. The nonprofit’s contractors submitted plans for the single meter in July 2024 and Duke  Energy ran the underground service for the single meter in October 2024, Bailey said, but the power company didn’t notify the nonprofit that it wouldn’t provide service until February 2025.
The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) filed the complaint on behalf of the nonprofit.
“This came about because people who are already doing some of the most valuable community-building work out there found a way to use solar energy to lower the cost of living for our low-income neighbors,” said Nick Jimenez, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Using solar energy to lower the cost of living to help neighbors who need it is about the best use of solar I can think of. EMPOWERment is absolutely within its rights here and it deserves electric service immediately.”
EMPOWERment Inc., asked the state Utilities Commission for the following relief:

Require Duke connect electric service to EMPOWERment’s PEACH Apartments immediately, while the Commission considers this Emergency Complaint and Request for Declaratory Ruling, to prevent the risk of irreparable harm and health risks from the lack of essential electric service.
Order that Duke permit the use of “master” meters when the lease between landlord and tenant states that the cost of electric and/or gas utilities is included in rental payments, as set forth in G. S. § 143-151. 42(b)(2).
In the alternative, declare that a multifamily residential building is eligible to use a single “master” meter, with the Commission’s approval, when served by a solar array.
Require Duke to provide permanent electric service to the PEACH Apartments under the current single-meter configuration.

At issue in the disagreement is state law prohibiting master meters for electric and natural gas service in new residential buildings. One section of the law outlines an exception to the prohibition if the tenant and landlord agree in the lease that the cost of the electric service or natural gas service, or both, will be included in rental payments. North Carolina has generally required individual meters and service in tenants’ names for each unit in new residential building constructed on or after Sept. 1, 1977.
Bailey told NC Newsline that the energy utility would be paid by tenants in monthly rent payments under lease agreements between the nonprofit and tenants. The amount charged would depend on the number of bedrooms in the apartment, she said.
To rewire the units so that each has a meter would cost the nonprofit about $86,000, Bailey said.
“We don’t have that,” she said. “We don’t have that laying around somewhere.”
Bailey said it would take to three to six months to receive the parts needed to rewire the apartments if the nonprofit decided to go that route.
“My apartments are 85% done,” Bailey said. “I can’t have them sitting around for six months without an air conditioning to control the humidity in North Carolina. When it rains like it does and it gets hot like it does, I’m inviting mold issues.”
Duke Energy said it cannot comment on specific customers’ accounts. But did provide this statement in an email from spokesman Jeff Brooks: “Duke Energy service regulations, in compliance with North Carolina law, require residential units to have individual meters, no one master meter covering the entire building. These guidelines are in place to promote consistency in the quality and reliability of service to all customers.”
The nonprofit was unable to convince Duke Energy to allow the single meter to be used temporarily so families could move in while parts to rewire the building were ordered, Bailey said.
Further delays would cause hardships for tenants who planned to move into apartments last month, the complaint said. Target tenants earn between $11 and $16 an hour, Bailey said, and have been anxiously awaiting news about when they can move into the new apartments.
“EMPOWERment Inc., is a small nonprofit trying to do the right thing for all the right reasons,” Bailey said. “Thirty-percent and below [AMI] income are people like your grocery store baggers or your assistant teacher or the people who take your tickets at the movie theater — that’s who we’re working for.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PEACHdrawing-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-06-13 12:58:12.246835

Mike Lee, R-Utah, participates in a forum hosted by the Sutherland Institute at the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics on Oct. 14, 2024. (Katie McKellar / Utah News Dispatch)Utah Sen. Mike Lee is bringing back a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Utah and other Western states.
Lee says it will open up “underused” federal land for housing and help communities manage growth — opponents, including a number of Democrats in Congress and environmental groups, say it’s an attempt to pay for tax cuts and warn it will jeopardize access to public lands.
Introduced Wednesday evening, Lee’s amendment to congressional Republicans’ budget bill, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill,” renews an effort initially spearheaded by Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, and Mark Amodei, R-Nevada, that sought to dispose of 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah and some 450,000 acres of federal land in Nevada.
But Lee’s proposal is much broader — rather than earmark specific parcels of land for disposal like Maloy and Amodei’s amendment, Lee wants to require the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture to sell off a percentage of land managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
According to the amendment, both agencies would be required to dispose of between 0.5% to 0.75% of land they manage, which amounts to about 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. State and local governments would be allowed to nominate parcels of land, and would be granted priority to purchase.

Eleven states would be eligible — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Notably, Montana is exempt, and Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke was instrumental in sinking Maloy and Amodei’s original proposal, stating that selling public lands is a line he would not cross.

Though the scope is much bigger, Lee’s reasoning behind the proposal is the same as Maloy and Amodei’s — identify parcels of federal land near high-growth areas, and sell them at market value to local governments to use for housing, water infrastructure, roads and other development.
The amendment prohibits the sale of land that’s already designated, like national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas or national recreation areas. Land that has an existing right, like a mining claim, grazing permit, mineral lease or right of way is also off limits.
If it passes, the secretaries of the departments of interior and agriculture would have to prioritize nominating land that’s next to already developed areas, has access to existing infrastructure or is “suitable for residential housing.” The amendment also directs the secretaries to nominate land that’s isolated and “inefficient to manage,” and to reduce the checkerboard land pattern, the result of railroad grants in the 1800s that left small plots of private land scattered within swaths of federal land and vice-versa.
“We’re opening underused federal land to expand housing, support local development and get Washington, D.C. out of the way for communities that are just trying to grow,” Lee said in a video address. “We’re talking about isolated parcels that are difficult to manage, that are better suited for housing and infrastructure. To our hunters, anglers and sportsmen, you will not lose access to the lands you love. Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands.”
 

But that reasoning didn’t fly for a number of environmental groups, including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, which called Lee’s proposal an attempt “to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”
“Senator Lee’s never-ending attacks on public lands continue. His hostility stands in stark contrast with Americans’ deep and abiding love of public lands. Senator Lee’s plan puts Utah’s redrock country in the crosshairs of unchecked development,” said Travis Hammill, Washington, D.C. director for the alliance. “In Utah and the West, public lands are the envy of the country — but Senator Lee is willing to sacrifice the places where people recreate, where they hunt and fish, and where they make a living.”
The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, called Lee’s amendment “a shameless ploy to sell off pristine public lands for trophy homes and gated communities that will do nothing to address the affordable housing shortage in the West”; the National Wildlife Federation dubbed it a “fire sale” that is “orders of magnitude worse” than Maloy’s proposal; The Wilderness Society said it was “a betrayal of future generations and folks on both sides of the aisle” and warned that could spark political backlash.
Maloy’s proposal identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George. The land would have been used for water infrastructure (like reservoirs and wells), an airport expansion in St. George, new and widened roads, recreation and housing.
The proposal was widely celebrated by the water district and local governments, who said it would help them make adjustments as the region continues to experience rapid growth. But nearby tribes, environmentalists and politicians from both sides of the aisle were skeptical.

Kimberly Terrell, who served as a director of community engagement and a staff scientist with Tulane University’s Environmental Law Clinic, accused university leaders of trying to censor the work she’s doing to spotlight the harms to local communities plagued by industrial pollution.
Terrell said her research in collaboration with Floodlight highlighting job disparities in hiring at local petrochemical facilities triggered a backlash from state and university leaders. That led to her being put under an “‘unprecedented gag order” by the dean of the university’s law school, Terrell said in a prepared statement issued by a group calling itself the Louisiana Alliance to Defend Democracy.
Terrell resigned from the New Orleans-based university on Wednesday, saying she would rather leave her position than have her work used as a pretext “to dismantle” the law clinic.
“After being affiliated with Tulane for 25 years and leading groundbreaking research at (the law clinic) for seven years, I cannot remain silent as this university sacrifices academic integrity for political appeasement and pet projects,” Terrell wrote in a letter to her colleagues.
On Thursday, a university spokesperson said Tulane is “fully committed to academic freedom” and “the strong pedagogical value of law clinics.” Tulane declined to comment on Terrell’s resignation, calling it a personnel matter.

“Debates about how best to operate law clinics’ teaching mission have occurred nationally and at Tulane for years — this is nothing new,” the university said. “We have been working with the leadership of the law school for the past several years to better understand how the clinics can most effectively support the university’s education mission.”
Kate Kelly, spokesperson for Gov. Jeff  Landry, said in an email that the governor never threatened to withhold state funding for the project. “However,” she said, “I applaud Tulane for their actions standing up for our Louisiana businesses and jobs.”
‘Punished’ for doing her job?
Terrell’s resignation is drawing outrage from grassroots environmental advocates in the state who credited her with providing data and scientific research substantiating the harm from the petrochemical industry suffered by the predominantly Black communities in southeast Louisiana.
“It’s appalling,” said Jo Banner, who co-founded a nonprofit focused on community activism and cultural preservation in St. John the Baptist Parish.
“We are frustrated that a person who is just doing their job, and doing it well shouldn’t be punished for it, she would be uplifted,” Banner said.
Her twin sister and co-founder, Joy Banner, added: “I cried at what is being done to someone who is so committed to just helping people, and doing right, and giving people access to objective information … that she is being penalized and censored so much. This is an attack on her freedom of speech.”
An April 25 email provided to Floodlight from Tulane Law School Dean Marcilynn Burke states that “effective immediately all external communications” from the law clinic that were not “client based” would have to be approved by her. That communication included “press releases, interviews, videos, social media postings, etc.”

In another email, dated May 4, Burke noted that the job disparity research was impeding the university from gaining political and financial support for its $600 million downtown redevelopment project in New Orleans. The email said Tulane University President Michael Fitts was facing criticism from elected officials and potential donors of the public-private project unless the university’s leadership curtailed the work of its environmental law clinic.
“At present, the president is focused upon the role of the staff scientist,” Burke wrote. “He understands her role in supporting the clinic’s representation of the clients. Thus, I need an explanation of how the study about racial disparities relates directly to client representation.”
The email goes on to say, “He is concerned, however, that her work may go beyond supporting the clinic’s legal representation and veer into lobbying.”
Job disparities research cited
Floodlight reported on the research Terrell led for the university in April 2024 while it was still undergoing peer review. Preliminary data showed that minorities were being “systematically” underrepresented in the U.S. petrochemical workforce — despite promises that nearby communities would benefit from better job opportunities.
Terrell said the pollution vs. jobs narrative was oversimplified because the tradeoff affected different groups unevenly, with petrochemical jobs mostly going to white workers who don’t live in the predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods that suffer most of the health impacts of that industry. That research and Floodlight’s reporting was recently featured in a documentary produced by The YEARS Project.
Nationally, Terrell’s research found that higher paying jobs in the chemical manufacturing industry disproportionately went to more white people in Texas, Louisiana and Georgia where minorities represent 59%, 41% and 49% of their respective states’ populations but held 38%, 21% and 28% of the better paid jobs within the industry.
In the petroleum/coal industry, people of color were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs in at least 14 states — including Texas, California, Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois, the research found.

Terrell, in her letter to colleagues, said the gag order came after the research had been peer reviewed and published online on April 9 in Ecological Economics. 
Terrell said the research on job disparities has already been cited in legal arguments for student attorneys in the law clinic on behalf of clients from industrialized communities. And she said her 2022 study highlighting the health impacts in Cancer Alley ranks in the top 1% for research impact, garnering 28 citations and 87 news mentions to date, according to Almetric, which tracks the reach of research. 
“Such impact would be celebrated by most institutions,” Terrell wrote. “Scholarly publications, not gag orders, are the currency of academia. There is always room for informed debate. But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”
The Banner sisters are concerned Terrell’s departure and the university’s focus on restricting the work of the law clinic will likely make collaborations harder going forward. 
“They’re following their responsibility, they’re following the mission of the organization, and answering our call for help, and then now they’re getting slammed for it,” Joy Banner said. “The foundation the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic has already built, they can’t tear that down. No one has questioned her findings. No one has questioned her assumptions. The only thing that they have said is: The truth is creating problems for us.”

The state performed especially well in health, placing fifth among all states. But it ranked lower in other areas: 26th for economic well-being and 22nd for measures related to family and community.
Connecticut has fewer children in poverty and more high school students graduating on time. But more teens are not working or studying, and math and reading proficiency has dipped in recent years. 
Other measures, such as the rate of teens not working or in school, as well as math and reading proficiency, have worsened. The percentage of 3- and 4-year-olds not in school, for example, grew from 35% to 40%.
The rate of children without health insurance, children and teens who are overweight or obese and children living in households with a high housing cost burden remained the same.
The 2025 KIDS COUNT Data Book Interactive shows some differences based on race and the region the child lives. 
In 2024, most Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino fourth-graders in Connecticut were not proficient in reading. By this stage, children are expected to use reading to learn other subjects, according to the report. Compared to the regional average, Connecticut performs slightly better. In the Northeast region, 66% of fourth-graders were not proficient in reading, compared to 64% in Connecticut. 
But when the data is broken down by race, deeper disparities are seen.
In Connecticut, poverty also disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic children. According to the latest 2023 figures, 26% of Black or African American children and 26% of Hispanic or Latino children live in poverty.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-11-at-3.58.23 PM-1024x465.png,,,2025-06-13 11:57:58.047857

(Aerial photography by Ed Saunders)Some economic development leaders said this week Montana needs the new methane-fired gas plant NorthWestern Energy built and want the Public Service Commission to greenlight its rate case.
“It’s reliable baseload like Yellowstone (the Yellowstone County Generating Station) that keeps us in business and keeps the economy moving,” said Paul Green, executive director of Big Sky Economic Development Authority.
NorthWestern Energy built the new plant, the Yellowstone County Generating Station, without preapproval by the Montana Public Service Commission, arguing it needed to move quickly to save money.
The 175-megawatt plant in Laurel is a contested part of the rate case in a complex and controversial hearing underway this week and next week at the regulatory agency.
The monopoly utility wants customers to pick up the tab for the plant, arguing it is necessary for reliable and affordable power supply.
Opponents, though, say much more affordable options were available compared to the estimated $320 million plant, as are sources that don’t pollute as much.
Every day during the hearing, the PSC is taking public comment in advance of witness testimony, and economic development leaders and current and former legislators are among those offering perspectives.
Green, also former head of the state Department of Commerce, said he appreciates renewable options, especially the wind and solar being developed on the eastern plains.
He said those options offer another revenue stream to strapped farmers and ranchers.
Green said he can see Montana being the “driving force” for energy in the northern plains region, but it can’t play that role without the plant and NorthWestern.
“That’s one thing that I love about seeing the Yellowstone County generation facility and NorthWestern willing to partner with us on making sure that we have a base load,” Green said.
Former state Sen. Mary McNally, however, said a large portion of the requested rate increase is due to the new plant, but NorthWestern didn’t need to build one of the costliest options.
McNally said Lazard, a global financial advisor, found utility scale solar and wind plus storage to be “two of the least expensive technologies,” but large gas plants and coal “two of the most expensive.”
“It was the utility’s choice to build the methane plant with no preapproval or public input,” said McNally, who served on energy committees in the 12 years she spent in the Montana Legislature.
She said customers already experienced a 28% increase in a settlement the PSC approved in October 2023, and commissioners should protect them from unnecessary costs in the current case.
“It is up to the commission to prevent shifting the cost of this risky decision on the consumers,” McNally said.
McNally, a Democrat, also said the more than 10% return on equity NorthWestern is requesting is “excessive,” and the PSC should approve a rate more in line with other regulated utilities and industry norms.
But Republican Rep. Gary Parry said he supports NorthWestern’s request.
Parry said he is proud to represent Colstrip, whose identity and economy are deeply intertwined with energy, and he’s grateful NorthWestern is continuing to invest in the coal-fired facility there.
Last summer, NorthWestern announced it was acquiring more shares of the Colstrip plant even as other owners unload coal.
A 2023 report from Energy Innovation Policy and Technology estimated 99% of all coal plants in the U.S. were more expensive than solar, wind or energy storage.
Beyond Colstrip, Parry said he considers the utility’s investment in the Yellowstone County Generating Station a “prudent, forward-thinking action” to diversify its portfolio. 
Parry serves as chairperson of the Energy, Technology and Federal Relations Committee of the state House of Representatives.
“As a lawmaker deeply invested in Montana’s energy future, I believe that supporting NorthWestern Energy’s request for a rate adjustment is a necessary step towards sustaining and modernizing our energy infrastructure,” Parry said in a statement read by a PSC staff person. “It will enable the company to maintain and expand critical generation assets, including Colstrip and the Yellowstone County Generating Station, while continuing to deliver reliable service to customers across the state.”
Sen. Mary Ann Dunwell, though, said NorthWestern Energy appears to be “layering rates upon rates upon rates,” including recently in a way that circumvented the authority of the PSC.
Dunwell, a Helena Democrat, said usually, there’s no clear answer in policy decisions, but in this case, she said, the PSC should easily reject NorthWestern Energy’s rate increase.
Kelly Sullivan, executive director of the Butte Local Development Corporation, spoke in favor of the rate request from NorthWestern and said the utility worked with other parties to come to reasonable settlements under consideration by the PSC.
“NorthWestern knows that bill increases are hard with other costs of living rising too, and they’re ready to help those who may be struggling with their bills,” Sullivan said. “At the same time, they need to cover their costs in a fair manner in order to maintain existing and add new infrastructure to best serve their customers.”
Patrick Barkey, of Potomac, said it’s also important to realize investors are watching the Public Service Commission’s actions.
Barkey, who spent the last 18 years analyzing the economy and power industry in Montana, said if investors can’t get a good rate of return in Montana, those dollars will go elsewhere.
“This is a time when investment is needed to head off threats from system reliability, from wildfire mitigation, harden systems from cyberattacks, and support the load growth that a growing economy will generate,” said Barkey, former head of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana.
The PSC hearing is expected to continue through June 20.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Methane-Plant1.int_-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-06-13 11:57:58.047857

The ruling stems from a claim for compensation filed under the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause, which requires just compensation when private property is taken for public use, a process known as eminent domain. Attorneys from the St. Louis firm Lewis Rice represented the landowners.
“If the government takes 10 feet or 10 acres, you should be rightly compensated,” said attorney Meghan Largent.

At issue is a 24-mile stretch of former railroad corridor between Tyndall and Ravinia in southeast South Dakota. On Aug. 18, 2023, the federal Surface Transportation Board issued a notice allowing the removal of the tracks and conversion of the corridor into a public trail. The stretch is part of a larger proposed rail-to-trail project, converting a 75-mile portion of the old Napa-to-Platte rail line to a trail from Tabor to Platte.
A spokesperson with the transportation board declined to comment.
Some sections of the rail-to-trail land are owned by the state. However, Largent said some sections within the 24-mile stretch are under easements, which are agreements allowing the crossing of someone else’s land. She successfully argued that the purpose of the easement can’t be changed without just compensation to the landowners.
She said the $128,000 will be paid out of a federal judgment fund, and efforts to create the trail will continue regardless of the lawsuits.
Robert Foley is with Friends of the Tabor to Platte Rail to Trail.
“No, it doesn’t really doesn’t impact the project,” he said. 
Foley said the project is moving forward. He said the group is raising its final $5,000 of funding for a $250,000 feasibility study. He said the study should be completed by late fall. 
Largent said her analysis shows another 120 landowners along the corridor qualify for compensation. They have until Aug. 18, 2029, to file a claim. The firm is already pursuing two more cases.

(Photo by Roger Riveland/For the North Dakota Monitor)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
Colleges urged to assess measles risk as spread continues in North Dakota 

The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”
In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
Outbreak moves north
In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”

Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
Student vaccination exemptions increased since COVID

It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas
According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 6, there are 1,168 confirmed cases affecting 33 states. Texas reported two more cases June 10, and Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 17 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Toney is community care coordinator at Liberation Place and Garcia is executive director and founder of the Kansas Birth Justice Society. (Submitted)TOPEKA — More Kansans will die during pregnancy and childbirth as a result of proposed federal cuts to Medicaid, says the leader of a state organization focused on maternal health equity.
A new analysis of cuts contained in the GOP’s “big beautiful bill” under consideration by Congress shows that 13,000 Kansans would lose enrollment in Medicaid, and the state would lose $3.77 billion in federal funding.
Sapphire Garcia, executive director and founder of the Kansas Birth Justice Society, said the gutting of Medicaid funding would decimate perinatal care systems and accelerate maternal mortality. The burden, she said, would fall hardest on those who already face steep inequities — Black, Indigenous, rural and low-income Kansans.
Advocates “on the front lines of this crisis” already are exhausted, she said.
“We are tired of fighting a system that continues to ignore our pleas while our communities are left grieving unbearable losses,” Garcia said. “We hold space for families who have buried their babies, their partners, their birthing people — and then we’re asked to carry on as if that grief is not the result of policy choices. But it is.”
Garcia’s comments followed a panel discussion Thursday organized by the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund. The discussion centered on a recent report on access to maternal health care in Kansas and an analysis by Manatt Health of proposed federal cuts to Medicaid.
The report on maternity care access, which was produced by the Kansas Center for Rural Health with funding from the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund, found that most Kansans don’t have local access to inpatient maternity care. Most Kansas counties don’t even have an OB-GYN, and only eight counties have more than five OB-GYNs, the report found.
One of the panelists, Beth Oller, family medicine physician at Rooks County Health Center, said it is difficult to get physicians to move to rural areas, where they might have to cover the ER and provide hospice care and other services to support an undeserved community. And most family doctors who graduate residency don’t have an interest in providing obstetric care, she said.
For a while, she said, she was one of two OB-GYNs at her health center, and the other wasn’t trained for operative deliveries. She spent two years never being off of work because she needed to be available for caesarean sections. Then, the other doctor moved out of state and she couldn’t recruit another physician.
As a mother of four, she said, she was “missing so many things.”
“I was heartbroken when I realized that our maternity unit was going to close,” Oller said. “However, I couldn’t do it anymore alone. I knew it wasn’t feasible to keep going that way.”
She said the closest place to Stockton, where she lives, to deliver a baby now is in Hays, about 45 minutes away. Another doctor travels two hours from Salina to provide some prenatal care, she said.
Panelists during Thursday’s discussion said access to maternal care is connected to Medicaid, which finances more than 40% of births in the state.
The state’s failure to expand Medicaid to serve more low-income families or allocate adequate reimbursement rates for Medicaid services are factors in maternal health deserts and the financial struggles of rural hospitals, they said. GOP leaders in the Legislature for more than a decade have blocked Medicaid expansion, which would have served about 150,000 adults and children and unlocked nearly a billion dollars in annual federal funding. Kansas is one of 10 holdout states that have not expanded the program.
“We need to remember that economics are policy, and policy is a matter of life and death,” Garcia said during the panel discussion. “The fact that we have not expanded Medicaid has killed birthing people in our state is going to continue to kill birthing people in our state and lead to these poor health outcomes. We need to acknowledge that this is a structural failure of our maternal and health care systems.”
A study published in 2020 by the medical journal Women’s Health Issues found that Medicaid expansion resulted in seven fewer maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.
Garcia told Kansas Reflector after the panel discussion that Medicaid expansion is a necessary step toward racial and reproductive justice. But now, she said, the most urgent concern is to protect Medicaid itself.
“If the federal program is slashed, expansion in Kansas becomes meaningless — there will be nothing left to expand,” she said. “Saving Medicaid must be our top priority, and we also cannot lose sight of the need to expand coverage here in Kansas, where families are still denied basic care due to arbitrary income thresholds and political inaction.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Facetune_12-06-2025-17-14-17-1024x1024.jpeg,,,2025-06-13 10:57:18.160179

On Sunday, Ward 5 Councilman Vernon Hartley, Drew Martin, the city’s attorney, and code enforcement officers discussed next steps for the complex, which, since April 30, has been without a property manager. 
“How are you all cracking down on other possible fraudulent property managers around Jackson?” one woman asked the city’s attorney, Drew Martin. 
“ We don’t know they’re there until we know they’re there, and I know that’s a terrible answer, but I don’t personally have another one I’m aware of right now,” Martin said. “These individuals don’t seem to have owned another apartment complex in the Metro Jackson area despite owning a whole bunch nationwide.”

Back in April, a letter was left on the door of the leasing office advising residents to not make rental payments until a new property manager arrives. The previous property managers are Lynd Management Group, a company based in San Antonio, Texas. 
The complex has been under increased scrutiny after Chapel Ridge Apartments lost its solid waste contract mid-March due to months of nonpayment. The removal of dumpsters led to a portion of the parking lot turning into a dumping site, an influx of rodents and gnats, and an investigation by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality. Local leaders pitched in to help remedy the situation, and in May, Waste Management provided two dumpsters for the complex. 
However, the problems persisted. In May, JXN Water released the names of 15 apartment complexes that owe more than $100,000 in unpaid water fees. Chapel Ridge was on the list. JXN Water spokesperson Aisha Carson said via email that they are “pursuing legal options to address these large-scale delinquencies across several properties.”

“While no shutoffs are imminent at this time, we are evaluating each case based on legal feasibility and the need to balance enforcement with tenant protections. Our focus is on transparency and accountability, not disruption—but we will act when needed to ensure the integrity of the system,” Carson said. 
And earlier this week, Chapel Ridge Apartments was declared a public nuisance. Martin said this gives the city of Jackson “the authority to come in, mow the grass, and board up any of the units where people aren’t living.”
Martin said the situation is complicated, because the complex is owned by Chapel Ridge Apartments LLC. The limited liability corporation is owned by CRBM Realty Inc. and Crown Capital Holdings LLC, which are ultimately owned by Moshe “Mark” Silber. In April, Silber was sentenced to 30 months in prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution. Earlier this month, both companies filed for bankruptcy in New Jersey.

Now, Martin said the main goal is to find someone who can manage the property.
“Somebody’s gotta be able to collect rent from you,” Martin said. “They got to be able to pay the water. They got to be able to pay the garbage. They got to be able to pay for the lights to be on. They got to maintain the property, so that’s our goal is to put that in place.” 
Valarie Banks said that when she moved into Chapel Ridge nearly 13 years ago, it was a great community. The disabled mother and grandmother moved from West Jackson to the complex because it was neatly kept and quiet. 
“It was beautiful. I saw a lot of kids out playing. There were people that were engaging you when you came out. They were eager to help,” Banks said. “ I hope that they could bring this place back to the way it once was.”
But after months of uncertainty, Banks is preparing to move. She said she’s not the only one.
“I have somewhere to go, but I’m just trying to get my money together so I can be able to handle the deposits and the bills that come after you move,” she said. “All of my doctors are around here close to me. In 12 years, I made this place home for me. … I’ve been stacking my rent, but it’s still not enough if I want to move this month.”
While she said she’s holding onto her rent payments for the time being, she realizes that many of her fellow residents may not be as lucky. Without someone to maintain the apartments, some residents are finding themselves without basic amenities.
“Some people are in dire straits, because they don’t have a stove or a fridge or the air conditioner,” she said. “Their stove went out, or the fridge went out, or they stole the air conditioner while you’re in the apartment.”
Banks isn’t the only one who is formulating a plan to leave. One woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said she’s been trying to save money to move, but she already has $354 wrapped up in a money order that she’s unable to pass off for her rent, due to the property manager’s recent departure. 
“It really feels like an abandonment and just stressful to live where I’m living at right now. This just doesn’t happen. It just feels stressful. It doesn’t feel good at all,” she said. 
She’s trying to remain optimistic, but as each day passes without someone to maintain the property, she’s losing hope.
“ I just hope that things get better some day, somehow, hopefully, because if not, more than likely I’m going to have to leave because I can only take so much,” she said. “I can’t continue to deal with this situation of hoping and wishing somebody comes, and they don’t.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12154112/3X0A4559.jpg,,,2025-06-13 10:57:18.160179

The clock is ticking on Milton’s chance for compliance with MBTA Communities. The planning board and residents are still divided heading into a special town meeting on Monday.
The post Town Meeting vote on MBTA Communities looms for a divided Milton appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","A DIVIDED MILTON heads to Town Meeting on Monday, where meeting members will consider an array of rezoning plans to boost density in the affluent Boston suburb.  
But the only plan that would make the town compliant with the controversial MBTA Communities housing law will be presented to voters over the objections of the planning board that initially crafted it.  
And while town government decided against more litigation to fight the law, which requires that cities and towns served by public transit zone for a multifamily district of reasonable size, a suit brought by 16 Milton residents sits before a judge who just last week tossed similar arguments from nine other towns. In broad strokes, the towns are all arguing that the way the state housing office set its zoning regulations created unmanageable burdens for the towns, with significant grant funding at stake. 
Across the state, options are narrowing for municipalities to resist the housing mandate, which the Supreme Judicial Court ruled in January was constitutional once new regulations are put out properly. 
A Milton planning board meeting on Thursday brimmed with frustration and resignation.  
“We have some people in the town that express and feel fear,” said member Sean Fahy. “We have other people in the town that express and feel excitement. We have people that have concern, and we have people that have optimism. We have people that see financial success, and we have people that see financial harm. We have people that see developmental destruction, and we have people that see development that’s complementary to the town of Milton. And the divide that’s existed now for years really comes down to the classification of Milton.” 
Most members of the board are backing a plan that would treat the town as an “adjacent community” that would involve up-zoning by 10 percent of the town’s current number of units, or around 1,000 units. The state, however, considers Milton a “rapid-transit community” that is required to zone for a potential 25 percent increase in total units, or about 2,461 units. 
The argument turns on whether the Mattapan High–Speed Trolley, which trundles through part of Milton, should count as a subway under the regulations defining rapid transit, or whether the commuter rail and Red Line subway stops in neighboring municipalities mean that the town is more accurately “adjacent” to reliable MBTA options. 
After the planning board in May crafted, approved, and then withdrew a plan that would meet the 25 percent threshold, a group of citizens successfully petitioned to put the plan on the Town Meeting warrant anyway.  
“The plan that the planning board worked on is not perfect, but it is a good one,” said Town Meeting member Karen Friedman-Hanna, who was among those who organized the citizen’s petition drive. “We have three forms of public transit – that qualifies us as a rapid-transit community. Even if everything moves more slowly than people would like, that’s not what defines a rapid transit community.” 
Most speakers at the meeting Thursday supported the 10 percent plan, with a town meeting member describing his neighbors as “shocked” by the 25 percent option before them. Resident Joe Mazzotta, noting that the “tide is not in our favor” on the classification front, expressed concern that the latest higher density plan is “far from equitable” even after adjustments to reduce the pressure on the eastern side of town. 
He noted that Lexington, which was an early and enthusiastic adopter of new zoning, is dramatically reining in its expansive MBTA Communities zoning districts in the face of significantly more development proposals than first anticipated. 
The Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities reviewed both Milton plans, according to planning board member and secretary Cheryl Tougias, and found small issues to fix in the 25 percent plan. Regarding the 10 percent option, she said, the housing office simply stated that it was not a compliant plan. 
“I feel that Town Meeting has the right and the authority to adopt zoning that would allow us to be compliant,” Tougias said. “I am disappointed that this board decided to pull that back,” she said of the 25 percent plan, thanking the citizens for putting it forward anyway. 
Planning board member Margaret Oldfield distanced the board from the 25 percent version, saying “the planning board worked on the plan, but it is not our plan.” She remains unconvinced by arguments that up-zoning will have a positive impact on the town, even if tax revenues improve.  
“Not everything comes down to money,” she said. “We all are here for a reason. We’re here for our trees, here for our open spaces.”  
The suburbs are feeling the squeeze as city prices push residents out, she said, and “we are forced to fix a problem that Boston has created.” 
A Superior Court ruling on June 6 rejected every argument offered by nine towns to halt their compliance requirements. Superior Court Justice Mark Gildea, who is also the judge overseeing a lawsuit brought by 16 Milton taxpayers in late May, dismissed arguments from the towns that the housing law is an “unfunded mandate” that would present unique burdens for different municipalities if they saw a sharp increase in housing units. 
The zoning regulation, does not force the towns to approve construction, he wrote, and municipalities already have access to competitive grants specifically intended to address housing and infrastructure needs. 
Middleton’s select board met in closed executive session on Thursday night to review the court ruling and discuss potential litigation strategy. Milton’s Select Board decided last week not to pursue litigation, to the chagrin of several planning board members. 
Multiple select boards and community development officials over the past few years “all had an opportunity to fight for Milton, for its classification,” said Fahy of the planning board.  It took 16 residents, he said, “to bring an attempt at adjudication to resolve this issue.”  
He characterized the town’s executive government as ignoring the concerns of the 54 percent of voters who tossed the compliant zoning plan last year. “We punted as leadership of the town,” Fahy said. 
Gildea presided over a hearing on Thursday afternoon on the Milton case, which seeks an injunction stopping the state housing office from enforcing its determination that Milton is a “rapid-transit” community.  
Planning board members said they did not expect a clear ruling by the time Town Meeting starts on Monday. Several were already preparing for what they expect to be an overwhelmingly supportive vote for the 25 percent plan, as Town Meeting passed a compliant plan in 2023. 
Without weighing in on either version, resident Leonard Glynn offered one of the last remarks of Thursday evening’s discussion.  
“Our state government was attempting to address what’s a genuine national problem,” he said. Generations of children, including his own, can’t imagine buying a home without assistance from their parents. Whether the 10 percent or 25 percent wins out, he said, “I’m in favor of Milton doing the best we can to encourage housing construction, within reason.”

(Getty Images)A new opinion issued this week by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita asserts that law enforcement officers can arrest and detain individuals caught driving without a license — including undocumented immigrants — and book them into a county jail.
The Republican attorney general said the opinion, dated June 11, was requested by Jackson County Prosecutor Jeff Chalfant and seeks to address “a critical public safety issue amid growing concerns about illegal immigration and its impact on Indiana’s roads.”
Attorney general opinions are legally non-binding.
Rokita maintained that drivers who drive without ever having a license — a Class C misdemeanor under Indiana law — cannot be released from a scene because they’re unable to provide the information required for a written promise to appear in court.
He pointed to a specific state statute allowing traffic offenders to be released without going to jail. But that document must include a valid license number. Because individuals without a license cannot meet that requirement, the opinion concludes they are not eligible for release under state law.










By its terms, the (state) statute’s release provision does not apply to a person arrested for the misdemeanor of driving without a license. A person who has never been licensed cannot, by definition, provide a driver’s license number ... and therefore is not entitled to be released.


– opinion issued by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita


“Hoosiers deserve safe streets, and that starts with ensuring those who break our laws face consequences,” Rokita said in a statement. “This opinion gives our law enforcement guidance to hold accountable anyone, especially illegal aliens, driving without a license — a crime that puts our communities at risk.”
In a Friday news release, his office further held that “illegal aliens operating motor vehicles pose unique and serious safety risks, and that “booking an illegal alien at a county jail for driving without a license will ensure that federal authorities are notified of the arrest and able to make arrangements to apprehend the alien if they choose to do so.”
Rokita noted that driving without ever being licensed is different from driving on a suspended or revoked license — a violation that’s typically treated as an infraction, unless the individual is a repeat offender. The opinion clarifies that law enforcement has full authority to arrest and process individuals who have never received a license.
The attorney general emphasized, too, that undocumented immigrants are unable to obtain valid driver’s licenses in Indiana, and that some use out-of-state licenses that are not recognized by Indiana law.
“Illegal aliens cannot drive on Indiana roadways because they are barred from obtaining valid licenses, but they do it anyway because they don’t respect our laws,” Rokita continued in his statement. “This opinion should provide clarity on law enforcement’s ability to detain these offenders, ensuring they face justice rather than being released back onto our streets.” 
The opinion also cites U.S. Supreme Court precedents affirming law enforcement’s ability to arrest for minor criminal offenses and to hold individuals up to 48 hours pending a court determination of probable cause.

Without the incentives, they would go to another state.
Those arguments persuaded the General Assembly to authorize $23.7 million of state-backed bonds to build railroads in the 1850s. Local governments also issued bonds to lure railroads to their counties.
The railroads didn’t keep their promise to repay the bonds and interest ballooned the debt to $32.3 million by the end of the Civil War. And at the State Convention of 1875, delegates voted to stop lawmakers from ever promising the state treasury as security for private debt.
Over the last two weeks, history didn’t repeat, but it did echo.
The Missouri General Assembly listened to a modern group of promoters who convinced lawmakers to promise almost $1.5 billion over 30 years for bonds that will finance new or improved stadiums for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals.
The local government that wants to host the teams must also offer financial support.
Professional sports are big business, and supporters warned the state would suffer economically if either or both teams move to Kansas. And, they said, the state’s image would suffer.
Welcome to the latest installment of Rudi ’splains it for a look at Missouri’s history with economic development incentives. The 19th century aid to railroads is connected to the 21st century aid to sports stadiums because both times, lawmakers promised borrowers would be paid from tax revenues.
The bill passed this week is a promise that future taxes will pay the bonds. That wasn’t the case for the railroads, which were supposed to repay the debt from business profits but never did.
 An 1862 ad for the North Missouri Railroad from the St. Louis Daily Missouri Republican. The road was built with $4.3 million of state-backed bonds that became the responsibility of taxpayers when the company defaulted on the debt (Image from the State Historical Society of Missouri online collection).
When a State Convention met at the end of the Civil War, it put a question before voters: “Shall the Railroad bonds be paid?”
The ballot measure imposed a gross receipts tax on railroads and a statewide property tax. Voters approved it. The railroads never paid, but property owners did. 
The bond payments exceeded all other state government expenses.
That’s why the next State Convention voted to prevent a repeat of the financial fiasco. Missouri had learned its lesson.
“It was while listening to this delusive talk, to this cuckoo song, that the country was plunged into the enormous railroad debt which has been created for the state, the cities and counties and for individuals all through the land,” said delegate Thomas Gantt of St. Louis. “People imagined that the benefit that was to come to the state, the city, county and the farm by the construction of those improvements was going to enrich all who were within hearing of the whistle of the locomotive.”
The prohibition on lending state or local credit, or giving state or local public money, to private interests remains a part of the state Constitution. 
During debate on the stadium bill, opponents questioned whether the prohibition was being violated.
“The reason why the Constitution forbids that is because the drafters of that language knew that eventually the legislature would appropriate money to the people who we consider our friends, at the expense of everybody else in the state, instead of appropriate money or spend money for the good of all the general welfare of our state,” said state Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon.
Despite the prohibition, Missouri provides hundreds of millions annually in economic development incentives. In fiscal 2024, the state authorized $403 million in tax credits including $114 million for projects to rehabilitate old buildings, $84 million to build low-income housing and $101 million for new or expanding businesses through the Missouri Works program. 
Tax credit holders redeemed $904 million during the fiscal year, cashing in credits issued in past years.
You may ask yourself, what makes one form of incentive legal and another illegal? The answer comes from the Missouri Supreme Court.
When I was just a sprout of a reporter, still in journalism school, St. Louis had two daily newspapers, the Post-Dispatch and the Globe-Democrat. My professor, Phill Brooks, will tell you my reporting in the fall of 1986 is the reason there is only one today.
The Globe-Democrat was a conservative newspaper and backed Republican Gov. John Ashcroft editorially. It was also failing, and businessmen John B. Prentis and William E. Franke, the owners, won approval of a $15 million state-backed loan to purchase a printing plant.
I found, unsurprisingly, that both Prentis and Franke were contributors to Ashcroft’s campaign. What was surprising is that only the five Republican members of the Missouri Industrial Development Board, also contributors to Ashcroft, attended the meeting that approved the Globe-Democrat loan.
The loans were backed by a promise that, in the case of default, bondholders would receive tax credits equal to 50% of their loss. Ashcroft became concerned about the optics of the deal, didn’t issue the loan and the newspaper folded.
In a test case, involving a loan to a Joplin company, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled the program violated the Constitution.
“This tax credit is as much a grant of public money or property and is as much a drain on the state’s coffers as would be an outright payment by the state to the bondholder upon default,” the court ruled in January 1987. “There is no difference between the state granting a tax credit and foregoing the collection of the tax and the state making an outright payment to the bondholder from revenues already collected.”
More recently, in 2023, lawmakers put $8.5 million into the budget for a no-interest loan to help Magnitude 7 Metals keep its New Madrid smelter open. Then-Gov. Mike Parson vetoed the money, citing the constitutional prohibition.
The reason the current tax credit programs are legal and the one the Globe-Democrat tried to use was not is, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled in 2011, that the U.S. Supreme Court had decided that tax credits are not the same thing as a direct expenditure of public funds.
But the stadium bill does promise a direct appropriation from the treasury. 
Neither the Chiefs nor the Royals, however, will issue the stadium bonds or be directly responsible for paying the debt. That will be the job of either the Jackson County Sports Complex Authority, a public entity that owns the stadiums, or a new public entity created for the location where a new stadium is built.
That means the direct payments for the stadium probably don’t violate the constitution. 
But don’t rely on me. I am not a lawyer or a judge.

Read this story in English.
Al finalizar la sesión legislativa de Connecticut de 2025 el miércoles por la noche, los legisladores habían adoptado un nuevo presupuesto estatal bienal y aprobado docenas de proyectos de ley sobre una amplia gama de temas, desde alivios en los costos de energía hasta reformas al sistema de costos compartidos de educación especial de Connecticut.
Varios de los principales proyectos de ley que obtuvieron la aprobación final este año abordaron problemas que los legisladores habían intentado abordar repetidamente, sin éxito, durante sesiones legislativas anteriores.
A continuación, un vistazo a parte de esa legislación.
“Trabaja, vive, viaja” y parte justa
El proyecto de ley H.B. 5002, un proyecto de ley de vivienda de amplio alcance, es la legislación de vivienda más importante que ha surgido de la legislatura de Connecticut en años. Contiene múltiples disposiciones que los defensores de la vivienda han solicitado durante las últimas sesiones legislativas.
Entre ellas se encuentra una propuesta conocida como “Trabaja, Vive, Viaja”, cuyo objetivo es que los municipios aumenten la oferta de viviendas cerca de las estaciones de tren y autobús, priorizando la financiación de ciertas infraestructuras para los municipios que establezcan “distritos orientados al transporte público”, donde se permite cierto desarrollo sin necesidad de audiencias especiales ante la comisión de planificación y zonificación.
Activistas del “Trabaja, Vive, Viaja” han presentado propuestas como esta durante los últimos años, y se aprobó en comisión como proyecto de ley independiente durante las sesiones legislativas de 2023 y 2024. En 2023, fracasó antes de la votación en la Cámara de Representantes, y en 2024 se aprobó en la Cámara, pero no se convocó a votación en el Senado.
El proyecto de ley H.B. 5002 también incluye una política conocida en esta sesión como “Los municipios toman la iniciativa”. La propuesta analiza la necesidad regional de vivienda, la divide entre los municipios y asigna a cada uno un número determinado de unidades. Los municipios tendrían que incluir cómo planificarían y zonificarían esas unidades en sus planes 8-30j, que deben presentarse cada cinco años.
Es similar a las políticas de “parte justa” propuestas en sesiones anteriores y utiliza la metodología de una política de “parte justa” para determinar cuántas unidades de vivienda asequible necesitarían planificar y zonificar las ciudades, con el objetivo general de aumentar el parque de viviendas y reducir la segregación.
El proyecto de ley contiene otras especificaciones para las viviendas, incluyendo requisitos para construir unidades para familias y para ciertos niveles de ingresos.
Cambio climático
Durante los últimos dos años, los defensores del medio ambiente han expresado abiertamente su frustración con los legisladores por la falta de avances significativos en cuestiones climáticas, con críticas a los Demócratas tras el fracaso de esfuerzos anteriores para adoptar plazos más estrictos para la reducción de las emisiones de carbono, la implementación de vehículos eléctricos o la colaboración con otros estados para la compra de energía eólica marina.
Pero este año, la legislatura aprobó dos proyectos de ley prioritarios durante las últimas semanas de la sesión: uno que promete encaminar a Connecticut hacia cero emisiones netas para 2050, y el otro que contempla cómo abordar los aspectos inevitables del cambio climático.
Uno de esos proyectos de ley importantes fue el Proyecto de Ley Senatorial 9. La mayor parte del proyecto de ley, de casi 50 páginas, se centró en la preparación para los impactos del cambio climático con actualizaciones al Plan Hídrico Estatal, que exige a los municipios considerar el aumento del nivel del mar al realizar cambios de zonificación y exige la divulgación del riesgo de inundaciones para compradores e inquilinos de viviendas, entre otras disposiciones.
El otro fue el Proyecto de Ley de la Cámara de Representantes 5004, una legislación de cero emisiones netas que también incluía una mezcla de incentivos para marquesinas solares, sistemas de calefacción y refrigeración energéticamente eficientes, empleos verdes y empresas centradas en la sostenibilidad.
Educación infantil temprana
En 2023, el Gobernador Ned Lamont convocó a un “Panel de Expertos” para desarrollar un plan de cinco años para el sistema de educación infantil temprana de Connecticut.
En su informe final, el panel describió las medidas políticas y la financiación necesarias para “un sistema equitativo, de alta calidad y sostenible que garantice que cada niño tenga una base educativa de calidad que lo prepare para crecer, aprender y tener éxito”.
Este año los legisladores aprobaron un proyecto de ley que promete transformar el cuidado y la educación de la primera infancia para generaciones de familias.
El Proyecto de Ley 1 del Senado crearía una nueva dotación para la educación de la primera infancia que obtendría hasta 300 millones de dólares de los fondos excedentes cada año. Dependiendo de los fondos excedentes disponibles y de la rapidez con la que crezca el fondo, eventualmente permitiría que las familias con ingresos inferiores a 100,000 dólares no paguen por el cuidado de bebés y niños pequeños, así como por la educación preescolar, mientras que las familias con ingresos superiores destinarían un máximo del 7% de sus ingresos familiares anuales a dichos gastos.
El proyecto de ley también mejoraría los salarios de los trabajadores del sector del cuidado infantil y permitiría que los fondos se destinen a la ampliación o mejora de las instalaciones.

Gavin Newsom and set a schedule to more fully hear the closely watched case in the coming days.A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit issued a one-page order pausing implementation of U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer’s order issued just hours earlier that called for Trump to relinquish control of the National Guard by noon Friday.The panel asked the state to file a written brief by 9 a.m. Pacific time Sunday and scheduled oral arguments for Tuesday.The short 9th Circuit order did not explain the panel’s rationale for granting an administrative stay of Breyer’s order.The Trump administration appealed and asked for the stay shortly after Breyer issued his ruling Thursday evening. Breyer said the mobilization was illegal and there were limits to Trump’s statutory authority.Breyer’s order was “an extraordinary intrusion on the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to call forth the National Guard as necessary to protect federal officials, as well as his statutory authority … to mobilize state National Guards into federal service to quell riotous mobs committing crimes against federal personnel and property and to protect federal officials' ability to enforce federal law,” the administration said. “The order also puts federal officers in harms' way every minute that it is in place.”The state opposed the request for a stay, saying Breyer’s “extensive reasoning” had shown the state would be irreparably harmed without court intervention.Trump called up the state National Guard on Sunday in response to protests in Los Angeles over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. Newsom opposed the deployment, saying it would only make the situation more volatile.It was the first time in 60 years that a president called up a state’s National Guard over the objection of the governor.California sued the administration to block the federalization, arguing that the president unlawfully took control of the state National Guard.Breyer took the state’s side in his Thursday evening order, saying Trump violated the 10th Amendment to the Constitution that protects states’ rights.",,,,2025-06-13 10:57:18.160179

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, was elected to the Legislature in 2018, and she’s served as the House’s Republican leader since 2023.
Before Demuth could even grasp the speaker’s gavel, the 2025 legislative session had a rancorous start. A judge ruled one of the newly elected Democrats ineligible for office because he didn’t live in the district, and Republicans sought to use a temporary 67-66 advantage to win full control by threatening to unseat another Democrat, Rep. Brad Tabke, who won a contested race.
To prevent this usurpation, Democrats boycotted the session for three weeks and litigation ensued until the two sides came to an agreement: seat Tabke and Republicans could claim the speakership for the whole two-year session.
Demuth won the speakership under extraordinary circumstances, and she used her caucus’ power of exactly half of the House to force the DFL to roll back one of their signature policies — state-subsidized health insurance for undocumented immigrants. House Republicans also blocked numerous tax increases proposed by the DFL.
Long negotiations in the split Legislature caused the session to go into overtime, and lawmakers wrapped up their work and passed a $66 billion budget in a one-day special session on Monday.
The Reformer interviewed Demuth this week and asked her to reflect on the unorthodox session.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
How was your speakership? Did you have a learning period?
Because of the special session and so many things, it has been full of learning all the way through. There hasn’t been a time that I’m like, “Okay, I got this.” Things kept changing, and the historical nature of a tie for the second time in history.
When the Democrats decided to finally show up, I was elected as speaker. I don’t usually go down this road, but there was a historical piece: me being elected speaker as the first Republican woman to ever hold that role. But not just that, the first person of color to hold that for either party ever in the chamber.
But unfortunately, our Democrat colleagues chose not to appreciate the historical nature of that and voted against me, even though I still became the speaker for two years. They literally voted against the first person of color to ever hold that office, even though they say that is a very important thing.
What were some key moments for you this session?
Watching us come together and being able to, as I mentioned, do good work before the deadline. Democrats and Republicans coming together, making sure that our state has what it needs to be safe and to make some meaningful changes that will strengthen that going forward.
We really tried to attack the overspending that we saw over the last two years, trying to get ahold of the state budget, not wanting Minnesota families to experience higher costs. We heard Democrats say on the last day of special session, “We needed more revenue.” That translates to me that they missed the opportunity to raise taxes like they wanted to.
The other thing is, again, I was sworn in as speaker. Being the first Black speaker ever, I was also sworn in by Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, who is the first Black president of the Senate. I think that moment was very historic.
I’m surprised to hear you reference the historical nature of your speakership. You’ve been asked about race, and you downplay it. You’ve emphasized the importance of merit and hard work getting to this point. So why bring that up?
I appreciate you saying that I’ve emphasized merit, and I will always do that. When I’m reflecting over this session and looking at the historical things that have happened, that is a historical piece. I’m looking forward to when people are no longer surprised by the fact that a woman is the first whatever or the first person of color or Black person being where I am. 
But somebody needed to start it, and in this case — the first Republican woman and the first Black speaker, Republican or Democrat — I have set that standard now, and I’m looking forward to others following after me. You’re right. I don’t lead with that.
My Democrat colleagues always focus on race or gender, and in this case they chose to completely ignore it because I’m a Republican.
You’ve celebrated no tax increases, but that isn’t entirely true. There were at least a few tax increases, including increasing the cannabis tax from 10% to 15%. Leadership also agreed to repeal the electricity sales tax exemption for data centers, which increase costs on companies.
We really rejected the tax increases that would cover Minnesota families overall. Yes, there is a tax increase from 10% to 15% on cannabis. But Democrats wanted a fifth income tax tier. The governor had pushed for new sales taxes on services that were never taxed before. We really held the line on that.
On data centers, we were able to secure a longer timeline for their sales tax exemption. That is a true sign of a compromise. Perfect? Probably not, but a true sign of a compromise is that no one side gets absolutely everything they wanted.
Are you going to run for governor in 2026?
I always have to laugh when I get that question. If you would have asked me back in the early 2000s if I would ever think about running for school board, I would have told you I haven’t thought about it. Yet I did run for school board.
I remember when I was asked about running for the Legislature, I had never thought about it.
And so I’m telling you, I’m not saying I’m running for governor at all. I’m not telling you that, but I would have been foolish to have said “no” to anything in the past. So I’m not telling you yes.
What are your summer plans?
Obviously, we’re looking at the 2026 election and so I’ll be doing a lot of heavy work. Even though the tie has been great for Republicans in the House, we want an outright majority. That has been our laser focus for quite a while.
I’m also looking forward to spending time with family and decompressing a little bit, but I’m not sure when that gets to start.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250609_0469-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-13 09:56:54.488074

The “No Kings Day of Defiance” was organized nationwide at the same time a military parade will mark the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary in Washington, D.C. The date also coincides with President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.
In response to the planned rallies in Missouri, Gov. Mike Kehoe announced Thursday that he had activated the Missouri National Guard in preparation for the protests. The Guard will be mobilized only if “assistance is needed to support local law enforcement,” according to a news release from the governor’s office.
The rallies across the country are intended to “honor civil liberties for all” and protest deportation, U.S. actions in Gaza and recent funding cuts to government departments such as USAID, said Jeff Stack, coordinator of the Mid-Missouri Fellowship of Reconciliation and an organizer of the demonstration in Columbia.
A number of rallies are planned in Kansas City and St. Louis, with additional demonstrations scheduled in Boonville, Fayette, Marshall, Jefferson City, Warrensburg, Cape Girardeau, Springfield, Joplin, Rolla, St. Joseph, Poplar Bluff, West Plains, Kirksville, Maryville, Clinton and several other locations.
The demonstrations were spurred by the 50501 movement, a network of opposition that organizes and calls for protests across the country. The number refers to 50 protests, 50 states, one movement, according to the organization’s website.
It began on the social media platform Reddit after Trump’s second inauguration in January. The movement issued a statement earlier this month that “all No Kings events adhere to a shared commitment to nonviolent protest and community safety.”
Saturday is also Flag Day, a federal holiday that marks the adoption of the American flag on the date in 1777. No protest rally will be held in Washington, D.C., with the organizers saying it will “make action everywhere else the story of America that day.”
The rally in Columbia will be a “nonpartisan event,” Stack said. It is not in direct response to the presence of the National Guard and ICE in Los Angeles, Stack said, but federal action on the streets of California is emblematic of what will be protested.
“We’re not aligned with one particular party,” Stack said. “We’re just concerned about the policies.”
The goals of “No Kings” are to “give people a chance to come together to air grievances” and “honor the human rights and civil rights that we all have,” he said.
Cutting federal funding, deporting immigrants, enacting policies that “benefit the wealthiest of the wealthy” and laying off scores of federal employees are examples of the grievances, Stack said.
The demonstration in Columbia will begin at 11 a.m. at the Boone County Courthouse, 705 E. Walnut St. Speakers will address the crowd until about 12:30 p.m., when there will be a march through downtown.

At last some of those costs are being passed on to customers, the report said.
The news comes as recent polls show that voters strongly disapprove of the way President Donald Trump, the author of huge new tariffs, is handling the economy.
The Cleveland Fed represents the Federal Reserve System’s Fourth District — a region that covers all of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia. Eight times a year, it conducts interviews and online questionnaires with businesses, community organizations, economists and other sources.
The Beige Book report released last week said those sources “continued to suggest flat business activity in the Fourth District in recent weeks, and they expected activity to remain flat in the months ahead. Retailers noted a pullback in consumer spending, and manufacturers said that ongoing economic and trade policy uncertainty continued to dampen demand for their goods. Demand for professional and business services increased driven by higher demand for consultations amid the shifting regulatory environment.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A tariff is a tax on imports that is sometimes imposed to foster domestic industry. Sometimes they’re imposed in retaliation against perceived unfair practices by trading partners, such as China.
Since taking office, Trump has announced a bewildering array of on-again, off-again tariffs, including 50% ones on steel and aluminum that took effect last week.
The Consumer Price Index grew at a relatively moderate 2.4% in May, but the New York Times pointed out that it reflects only the initial impacts of the tariffs. While many of Trump’s tariffs have been delayed or are just beginning to take effect, the Cleveland Fed report said their effects are being felt.
“On balance, contacts indicated that nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace in recent weeks, continuing an upward trend that began after a period of stability in 2024,” it said. “Contacts from multiple sectors noted that tariffs were now increasing the costs of materials that they import. Some contacts also noted secondary impacts of tariff-related cost increases from domestic producers. For example, one manufacturer said that their U.S.-based raw materials suppliers raised prices to factor in the overtime needed to meet increased domestic demand.”
It added that its sources of food and hospitality information voiced relief over dropping egg prices. But they “generally expected costs to grow at a strong pace in the coming months.”

More of the fed’s sources said they increased prices than did in the previous reporting period. Some blamed tariffs.
“Contacts across industries, particularly those in manufacturing and construction, said that they raised prices to cover costs related to tariffs and to elevated prices of materials such as steel,” the report said. “Auto dealers generally mentioned raising prices of new and used vehicles, and one said that they were offering less discounting because of higher demand.”
Some of that demand, the report said, was from consumers trying to buy vehicles now because they anticipate higher prices in the future.
The news comes as Ohio has the nation’s sixth-highest unemployment, consumer confidence remains relatively low, and Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy.
A Quinippiac University poll released on Tuesday said that respondents disapproved of him on the economy by a 16-point margin. The president had an overall approval rating of 38%.

Nick Begich, R-Alaska, joined congressional Republicans in a 214-212 vote Thursday to claw back $1.1 billion in previously approved federal funding for public broadcasting, including tens of millions of dollars intended for radio and TV stations in Alaska.  The clawback, formally known as a rescission vote, was requested by President Donald Trump and do[...]","Rep.

Nick Begich, R-Alaska, joined congressional Republicans in a 214-212 vote Thursday to claw back $1.1 billion in previously approved federal funding for public broadcasting, including tens of millions of dollars intended for radio and TV stations in Alaska. 
The clawback, formally known as a rescission vote, was requested by President Donald Trump and does not take effect unless also approved by the U.S. Senate within 45 days.
The rescission would be enormously significant for Alaska’s public broadcasters, particularly those in rural Alaska. High Country News has reported that many of Alaska’s rural public radio stations are heavily dependent upon funding from the federal government.
A rescission would be even more significant than a budget cut, because it would instantly affect funding that has already been approved and included in local budgets. If Congress were to cut budgets going forward, stations might have at least some time to adapt. 
Stations on St. Paul Island, in Unalakleet, Sand Point and Talkeetna are among those that receive more than 70% of their funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the federally funded agency targeted by Thursday’s vote.
Stations in Sitka, Ketchikan, Petersburg and Haines are among those that receive at least a third of their support from the CPB.
At KUCB-FM in Unalaska, the station would instantly lose nearly half of its funding and would have to eliminate original programming. The same would take place at KYUK-FM in Bethel, which stands to lose almost 70% of its revenue. 
On June 6, Alaska Public Media published a listing of knock-on effects, including the loss of the only local reporters in many rural parts of the state. 
Even in the state’s urban centers, the funding loss would have devastating effects.
KNBA-FM in Anchorage could have to stop production of National Native News and Native America Calling, two nationally syndicated programs that broadcast Alaska Native and American Indian news.
In Juneau, the loss of funding would affect Gavel Alaska, the public broadcasts that cover legislative hearings in the state Capitol and elsewhere.
Begich, in a written statement, said the rescissions package is “a necessary step for restoring fiscal responsibility in our nation.”
During his election campaign last year, Alaska’s lone member of the U.S. House of Representatives said reducing the national deficit was a priority. He recently voted for a bill that increases the national debt by an estimated $2.4 trillion.
In Thursday’s statement, Begich said that “while rural communities have in the past been indirectly supported through state-sponsored media, we must acknowledge how far we have come in terms of connectivity since the birth of radio more than 120 years ago. Alaskan residents have embraced today’s pervasive cellular, satellite, and wireline technologies, connecting rural communities to critical information and resources in rich and compelling ways. Importantly, however, emergency management funding from these budgets that is directed to rural communities has been preserved.”
In addition to the impact on public broadcasters, the rescissions package eliminates billions of dollars in foreign aid.
“This rescissions package primarily targets ideologically-shaped foreign spending at USAID. Under both the Obama and Biden Administrations, USAID funding was misused to promote political and socially left policies abroad. This package helps refocus our support in ways that are consistent with America’s core values, rather than promote the agendas of international bureaucracies and ideological NGOs,” Begich wrote.
“America has been built on principles of freedom of expression, self-determination, sovereignty, personal responsibility, and limited government. This package supports those values by rescinding $9.4 billion from programs that do not reflect the will of the taxpaying public,” his statement said.
A poll commissioned by PBS earlier this year found that 65% of the public believes the public broadcaster is either adequately funded or underfunded.
In the Senate, a simple majority vote will be needed to approve the rescissions package. Republicans occupy 53 seats in that chamber and Vice President J.D. Vance would cast any tiebreaking vote, meaning that four Republicans would have to oppose the funding reduction for it to fail.
U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has said she supports funding public broadcasting. U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, while critical of NPR, has supported public broadcasting, particularly in rural Alaska.
Trump has said that the rescissions request is the first of several that the White House budget office plans to submit.

Individuals on the waitlist have been charged with crimes but not convicted. Many are detained for longer than they would be if they’d received the maximum sentence for their charges.
The length of the waitlist is up by over 40% from a year ago and over 80% from 2023, according to the latest figure provided during a monthly Mental Health Commission meeting on Thursday and data previously received by The Independent.

Nora Bock, director of the behavioral health division of the Missouri Department of Mental Health, said the “silver lining” of the situation is that more individuals have begun receiving care through a pilot program the legislature passed in 2023, which brings treatment to the jails. There are 18 individuals currently enrolled in that program, Bock said, “so this is good movement.”
People on the waitlist were arrested, found incompetent to stand trial and ordered into mental health treatment designed to allow them to have their day in court — a process called competency restoration that generally includes therapy and medication. Their cases are on hold while they wait for competency restoration.
The average wait time in Missouri has held steady at 14 months, Bock said.
There have been successful lawsuits in several other states arguing that months-long wait times for competency restoration is a violation of due process and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The consequences can be fatal. 
Last month, a 64-year-old named Timothy Beckmann, who had been found incompetent to stand trial and been waiting for months for treatment, was found unresponsive in the Jackson County Detention Center and brought to a hospital where he was declared dead.
In the seven months he spent in pretrial detention, Beckmann’s mental and physical health deteriorated, public defenders involved in the case told The Independent after his death.
The Department of Mental Health previously declined to answer questions, citing patient privacy laws, and Bock didn’t mention Beckmann in her presentation. The Jackson County sheriff’s office is still investigating Beckmann’s death and the medical examiner’s office hasn’t concluded its report yet, a spokesperson for the sheriff told The Independent Thursday.

 
The legislature in 2023 passed several measures in an attempt to ameliorate the waitlist. Those have been slow to get off the ground. Some of the remedies are years away, such as a new psychiatric hospital being built in Kansas City.
Bock said that there are two individuals receiving outpatient competency restoration now — meaning they were charged with low-level offenses and deemed safe enough to receive treatment in their community — “and I do anticipate that as we work with our other stakeholders that we’ll see that that increases over time.” Advocates have raised concern that patients are rarely referred to community-based treatment.
There are more patients in the pipeline: 61 people were evaluated and found incompetent who are waiting to be court ordered into DMH custody, Bock said. There are 213 open pretrial evaluations, of which Bock said the department expects around half to be found incompetent.
The waitlist is a result of limited bed capacity, workforce and a lack of community placements, officials have told lawmakers, as well as a surge in the number of court-ordered competency evaluations. 
Bock shared staffing data during the presentation as well. The group with the highest vacancy rate across state psychiatric hospitals is social workers, at 71%. 
“This is across our system, so it will vary by facility, but that’s a pretty staggering number for us to deal with,” Bock said. She said Fulton State Hospital struggles the most with staffing, with one-quarter of their direct care positions open, and a Kansas City hospital called the Center for Behavioral Medicine struggles the least, which Bock attributed to the job market and population.

During a news conference held by U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem in Los Angeles on Thursday, California Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed by federal agents after entering the press briefing and attempting to ask Noem a question. He was later forced to the ground and handcuffed, but was not detained.
At his own press conference afterwards, Padilla said he “was there peacefully” and attended Noem’s briefing to gather more information from Homeland Security after receiving no response to his inquiries about the department’s immigration enforcement efforts.

Padilla: “If this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they’re doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers…”

In an interview with Fox News, Noem said Padilla acted “completely inappropriate” because he did not identify himself, bursted into the room, shouted and lunged toward the podium — adding that “perhaps he wanted the scene.”
Democratic leaders were swift to condemn the administration’s actions: Gov. Gavin Newsom said the incident was “outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful.” In remarks on the Senate floor, fellow California Sen. Adam Schiff asked, “What is becoming of our democracy? Are there no limits to what this administration will do? Is there no line they will not cross?”
Meanwhile, Republicans defended the administration. GOP Assemblymember Joe Patterson of Rocklin said if he “busted into” a Newsom or Padilla news conference, “the same exact thing would happen to me.”

It’s been nearly a week since President Donald Trump deployed National Guard troops and U.S. Marines in L.A., following clashes between local police and demonstrators protesting against immigration raids in the city. 
Because Trump mobilized troops without the consent of state leaders, California filed a lawsuit to direct Trump to rescind his orders. On Thursday a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that Trump’s “actions were illegal,” and halted the president’s deployment. The ruling is scheduled to take effect today at noon and last until June 20. The federal administration is appealing the ruling.

State Farm in the hot seat

After receiving approval last month to temporarily increase rates following the deadly January wildfires in L.A. County, California’s largest insurer is now under state investigation.
California’s Insurance Department said Thursday it is officially investigating State Farm to determine whether the company is properly handling claims from the L.A.-area fires. For months wildfire survivors reported delays in payments; failure to get reimbursed for smoke damage; and difficulty getting timely responses from their claims adjusters.

Ricardo Lara, California Insurance Commissioner: “No one should be left in uncertainty, forced to fight for what they are owed, or face endless delays that often lead consumers to give up.”

As part of the investigation, the department is urging State Farm customers to keep submitting complaints. The probe is expected to last several months and the insurer is cooperating with the investigation.

Sevag Sarkissian, State Farm spokesperson: “A fair review will find that thousands of State Farm customers are being helped by our teams … and are very satisfied.”

Trump blocks CA’s electric vehicle phaseout

From CalMatters’ environmental team:
Trump on Thursday signed three measures that block California’s mandates to phase out gas-powered cars and clean up diesel trucks. And California immediately struck back with a lawsuit and a vow to continue setting standards.
The move by Trump and Congress deals a substantial blow to the state’s aggressive transition to electric vehicles and could upend its decades-long authority to clean up its air pollution, which is the worst in the nation.

Trump, at the White House: “We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate. And they’re never coming back.”

Last month, Congress used the Congressional Review Act to revoke three waivers that the Biden administration granted to California. Trump’s signing makes that official. The dispute between California, the Trump administration and Congress highlights the growing political division over electric vehicles and air pollution policy.
Many legal experts say that Congress has no authority to revoke the waivers. California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed suit, along with 10 other states, arguing that it’s an unlawful use of the review act. 

Bonta, in a statement: “The President is busy playing partisan games with lives on the line and yanking away good jobs that would bolster the economy — ignoring that these actions have life or death consequences for California communities breathing dirty, toxic air.” 

Newsom also issued an executive order Thursday, directing the Air Resources Board to craft another mandate for cars and trucks, and to create a list of automakers and truck makers that are following California’s emissions rules.
Because of its highly polluted air, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards in the 1967 Clean Air Act. Before now, the federal government has never blocked any of California’s dozens of rules.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Discussions about “tipping points” have been getting plenty of coverage in the last few years as the planet hurtles forward in a climate crisis we seem incapable of stopping. Ice caps and glaciers are melting, sea levels rising more rapidly than expected, acidification of the oceans, and vast wildfires sweep the globe as the Sixth Mass Extinction event wipes species from existence at a sickening pace.
What’s not been normally referred to as such is the “tipping point” we have now reached in the governance of our nation. But make no mistake, what’s going on right now with the would-be king in the White House fully qualifies as a tipping point — from democracy and adherence to the law and Constitution to a dictatorship under an individual who claims he is “done playing by the rules” and now turns our own military against we, the people.
Apparently this delusional old man has forgotten what happened the last time a king tried to suppress freedom in this country. That was 250 years ago, when those who fled the oppressions of monarchy for the liberty of a new nation rose up to throw the king’s heel off their necks.
Just as the founders of the United States kicked the king’s royal troops out, make no mistake that the fire of liberty and democracy continue to burn hot as the “No Kings!” movement sweeps our nation with more than 1,800 demonstrations planned for June 14th. If the red coats could not extinguish the flame of liberty on which this nation was founded, neither will the red hat grifter-in-chief who wants to play king.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the tipping point we have reached in Montana’s world famous rivers and wild trout fisheries.  As recently pointed out in a grim assessment of the impacts of the climate crisis here in the Big Sky State, we are at a point in early June with low flows and high water temperatures that have not occurred recently until late July-August.
How bad is it? Well, according to the fisheries biologists at Montana’s Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the Clark Fork and Blackfoot are at one-third of their usual flows. Stretches of the Big Hole are at their lowest levels in more than 15 years, with the upper river — where the last of the Fluvial Arctic Grayling in the lower 48 states are barely hanging on — has already hit 70 degrees, nearing the lethal point for trout and above that point for grayling.
The Madison River coming out of Yellowstone National Park is now reaching its historic 1931 lowest point, with flows at half of usual and, like the Big Hole, temperatures already approaching 70 degrees. It’s so bad NorthWestern Energy says it “may not be able to meet all the needs of the system” and is limiting outflows from Hebgen Reservoir, which is not expected to fill this year.
The Dearborn River, which drains the now basically snow-free Rocky Mountain Front, is already lower than it’s been in 55 years — likewise the Sun River, which is at a stunning 1/14th of usual flows.  A comprehensive assessment of our “read ’em and weep” river flows is here at the USGS site.
As our “tipping points” inexorably mount, the choices become clear. To protect our liberty and freedom, we must reject the would be king. To protect Montana’s world famous rivers, we must likewise reject his insane, planet-killing fossil fuel agenda — or neither our nation nor Montana’s famous rivers will ever “be great again.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_2439-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-13 08:56:58.589646

LAPD and the counties of San Diego, Orange, and Riverside have repeatedly shared automated license plate reader data to federal agencies


Law enforcement agencies across Southern California violated state law more than 100 times last month by sharing information from automated license plate readers with federal agents, records show.
The Los Angeles Police Department and sheriff’s departments in San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties searched license plate readings on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, according to a database of queries obtained by anti-surveillance group Oakland Privacy and provided to CalMatters.
Under a 10-year-old California measure, known as Senate Bill 34, state law enforcement agencies are barred from sharing license plate reader data with out-of-state public agencies or federal entities. The law has been routinely violated; civil liberties groups in 2023 found that 71 California law enforcement agencies had broken it. Later that year, Attorney General Rob Bonta issued an advisory providing police with specific guidance on how to comply with the law.
In addition to detailing the prohibition on out-of-state sharing, Bonta noted that operators of license plate readers must state the purpose of their use every time they access the information. 
This log is where police searching Riverside County data revealed their cooperation with ICE, often using the term “HSI,” referring to the agency’s Homeland Security Investigations unit. The term “CBP” was also repeatedly listed as a search purpose.
Among the 11 agencies that conducted searches on behalf of ICE, six are in Los Angeles County and 10 are in Southern California. Two agencies, the sheriff’s departments for Orange and San Diego counties,  carried out searches on the behalf of Customs and Border Protection or the Border Patrol.
“This is a big deal, it’s part of the problem, and we need the attorney general’s office to start litigating,” said Brian Hofer, former chair of the privacy commission for the City of Oakland.
Hofer said cities can put all the sanctuary policies on the books that they want, but if they’re not shutting down the data sharing between local authorities and federal agencies like ICE, those protections are meaningless. 
The Riverside County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. The Los Angeles Police Department declined to respond to questions from CalMatters about the search records. Bonta’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
San Diego County Sheriff’s Department provided a statement that said, “This matter requires further internal review. If any of our personnel are found in violation of our policies, we will take the appropriate action.”
“This is a big deal, it’s part of the problem, and we need the attorney general’s office to start litigating.”Brian Hofer, chair of the privacy commission for the City of Oakland
Tracy Rosenberg, executive director of Oakland Privacy, was disturbed by instances where police obscured the purpose of their searches by using vague terms, like “investigation” or “criminal justice,” raising the question of whether they were complying with Bonta’s guidance. By CalMatters’ count, this happened more than 64,000 times out of the 491,000 queries in the database of searches from April 28 to May 30.
“I’ve always been told all of this is carefully logged and tracked and they know why these logs are being accessed,” Rosenberg said. “But now that I’m in this log it’s obvious that they don’t, and the reasons are completely obscured.” 
Rosenberg found the vague reasons more disturbing than the openly disclosed federal searches — partly because they leave open the possibility that a search was carried out for a federal agency. Some agencies gave vague reasons for a majority of their queries.
“It seems like no one, [Riverside] Sheriff [Chad] Bianco included, knows why those location data searches were done in Riverside’s [license plate] database,” she said.
Automated license plate readers in Riverside County are part of a system powered by Flock, a company that works with law enforcement agencies in thousands of communities nationwide. The records obtained by Privacy Oakland came from a Flock audit report generated by the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office.

Evidence of the sharing comes less than a week after President Trump ordered the deployment of Marines and the California National Guard to Los Angeles amid escalating protests there against deportations. Roughly two weeks ago, 404 Media reported that local police in Illinois carried out searches on behalf of ICE agents.
The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department is headed by Sheriff Chad Bianco, a supporter of President Donald Trump. Bianco launched a run for California governor in February, shortly after telling local residents in a video posted on social media that Riverside County sheriff’s deputies “have not, are not, and will not engage in any type of immigration enforcement.” In the same video, Bianco said he plans to continue to fight to reform state sanctuary laws and that “I will do everything I can within the confines of the sanctuary state laws of California to cooperate with ICE to remove criminals from our jails.”
“We already knew that Sheriff Bianco supports Trump and his deportation machine,” said Javier Hernandez, executive director of Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice. The group of more than 35 organizations provides legal services for undocumented people and responds to alerts about ICE raids in Riverside and San Bernardino counties east of Los Angeles, a region known as the Inland Empire.
But Hernandez said Bianco still “has to follow the laws of this state even if he doesn’t agree with them.” The coalition plans to urge the attorney general’s office to investigate any violations of state law.
Seth Hall, a longtime member of the TRUST SD Coalition, which has called for controls on license plate readers in San Diego, hopes knowledge of local police sharing data with ICE can make a difference as TRUST SD mounts a campaign to convince the San Diego City Council to defund police use of Flock. An annual surveillance report released in February disclosed that the San Diego Police Department shared license plate reader data with several outside agencies including ICE and the Border Patrol. Cooperation with federal authorities, he said, is a sore point in San Diego after ICE raided an Italian restaurant earlier this month and community members fought back.
“It just hits a little harder when there’s people on the street setting off flash bangs,”he said.
State Senator Sabrina Cervantes, a Democrat from Riverside, introduced a bill to regulate automated license plate readers earlier this year, because “law enforcement agencies across our state are not following existing state law governing the use of automated license plate readers” and a audit by state employees in 2020 showed that. She did not respond to a request to comment on the sheriff’s license plate log.
The risk of automatic license plate readers has been brought into focus by deportations, said Rosenberg of Oakland Privacy. The longtime argument against building a surveillance state used to be hypothetical.
“It’s 2025 and it’s not hypothetical anymore,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/110524_Riverside-Election_JH_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-13 08:56:58.589646

Two popular Italian restaurants were swarmed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on May 30, prompting a remarkable response from neighbors who rallied to the scene and forced a retreat under shouts of “shame.”
Late that afternoon, dozens of ICE agents from the Homeland Security Investigations division entered the side-by-side Buona Forchetta and Enoteca Buona Forchetta restaurants, surrounding them with over a dozen vehicles. Police tape wrapped around government vehicles delineating an off-limits zone where dozens of federal agents congregated.
The disruption overwhelmed these already-crowded streets. Diners at nearby restaurants had been enjoying their meals and neighbors were walking their dogs. Children at Albert Einstein Charter Academy prepared to leave the schoolyard before they were directed to a back gate to avoid the commotion.
Aubree Miller, who has lived in South Park for the greater part of her adult life, described the experience to me in this way: “I was on my way to meet up with another neighbor and friend for happy-hour drinks when we were suddenly faced with a swarm of militarized people and a handful of unmarked cars cuffing and taking away people who have been a part of the fabric of the neighborhood for years.”
At Buona Forchetta, known for its award-winning Neapolitan pizza, ICE agents placed all the workers in plastic zip ties. I could see the officers walking around them when I arrived roughly 25 minutes after ICE agents forced their way inside.
One detained worker was being muscled into a van, shackled by handcuffs with ankle restraints. A total of four people were arrested that day — all service workers.
A crowd had already formed outside of Buona Forchetta by that point. Patrons of nearby establishments, parents with their children in their arms and even dog-walkers were taking turns challenging the masked ICE agents, telling them in colorful language that they weren’t welcome in this neighborhood.
An ICE tactical unit, geared up with helmets and rifles, tossed three loud flashbang grenades at the people who had surrounded their vehicles, intending to disperse them. 
In an email, Patricia Mondragon, a South Park resident and regional policy manager at Alliance San Diego, told me that when she arrived at the site of the raid, “it was filled with people yelling and I could see smoke. People with children or pets were rushing away from the intersection and I saw a lot of heavily armed and masked combatants.”

Of the four arrested workers, two remained at a for-profit detention center expecting to fight their removal from the United States. One signed a voluntary departure form and is now in Mexico. The fourth, a Colombian national with only a two-week work history at Buona Forchetta, his whereabouts were unknown.
ICE officials justified the raid by pointing to an unsealed warrant that claimed there were 19 instances where employees used fraudulent documents to gain employment. The warrant also alleged the owner of Buona Forchetta was “exploiting these employees by having them work over 12-hour shifts with no breaks,” according to an unidentified November 2020 complaint.  
San Diego County’s Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement wage theft judgement dashboard does not contain any record of Buona Forchetta being involved in a labor code dispute.
Still, this was not the first operation in San Diego County under the second Trump administration. In March, ICE and other federal agencies, including Border Patrol, conducted a worksite raid at San Diego Powder and Protective Coatings, a family-run company in unincorporated El Cajon that contracts with the federal government. 
In that operation, more than 60 federal agents reportedly held dozens of workers for over nine hours, restricting bathroom breaks and offering few snacks. Family members, fellow workers and community members protested outside the facility for hours.

Since late last month, ICE agents have also been arresting migrants appearing at immigration courts. The arrests resemble kidnappings because people are abruptly separated from accompanying family members and attorneys and disappear into elevators.  
In one case I witnessed in San Diego, ICE agents mistakenly detained “the wrong guy” who had a panic attack and fainted after being restrained, requiring a volunteer to call 911.
The confluence of these events in San Diego, alongside actions in other parts of the country where migrants were unlawfully sent to El Salvador, Guantanamo Bay or apprehended without much information about their whereabouts, has caused consternation about the degradation of rights and the heavy-handed approach ICE agents use to detain people.

Trump has now deployed 700 active-duty Marines in addition to federalizing several thousand National Guard troops to ostensibly conduct law enforcement duties in Los Angeles, triggering condemnation by border-based organizations “for the excessive use of force and the militarization of our communities.”
Despite the siege strategy displayed in ICE raids and the potentially disastrous presence of combat troops in major California cities, organizations like the National Day Labor Organizing Network called on allies to bring courage and anger, but “please leave your hatred at home. We are acting out of love.” 
It is that love that I heard from one of the long-time workers at Buona Forchetta when I asked him about the raid and what he witnessed. “I felt strengthened,” he told me in Spanish, about seeing the neighbors that rallied against the ICE agents and in defense of those arrested.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125-Socal-Raid-PR-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-13 08:56:58.589646

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The group pushing for a rail line in eastern Utah that would allow the state to ramp up oil production is hoping to fund the project through $2.4 billion in U.S. Department of Transportation bonds. 
The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition for years has been lobbying for the 88-mile Uinta Basin Railway, which would connect the oil-rich region of northeastern Utah to national rail lines, facilitating the export of waxy crude oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast. 
To pay for the railway, the coalition — which consists of representatives from Dagget, Carbon, Duchesne, Emery, San Juan, Servier and Uintah counties — approved a resolution last month announcing its intent to seek $2.4 billion in private activity bonds from the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
That’s a $500 million increase from 2023, when the coalition passed a similar resolution seeking $1.9 billion in federal bonds.

The railway extension could allow for the transport of an estimated 350,000 barrels of oil each day, massively increasing the state’s oil production. The refineries in Salt Lake City, for instance, currently have a market capacity of 85,000 barrels per day. 
But connecting the Uinta Basin to national rail lines means increased oil exports through Colorado, which has proved to be a major sticking point. In 2022, environmental groups and Colorado’s Eagle County sued the coalition, arguing that the federal Surface Transportation Board — the agency tasked with the environmental review — fell short in its analysis, failing to consider the risks of the railroad expansion. 
The project cleared a major roadblock in May after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a prior court ruling that found the environmental review was incomplete. The ruling returns the case to a lower court for consideration.
“This was not only a win for the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition and counties in the state of Utah, but a win for the United States in being able to move forward with a major infrastructure project,” said Greg Miles, a Duchesne County Commissioner who sits on the board of the coalition, during a public meeting Thursday. “There’s a lot of things that oil does for us in our lives.” 
And although it still faces regulatory and legal hurdles, the coalition has made several moves over the last month toward financing the railroad. On Thursday, it heard public comments related to the bonds. 
The Department of Transportation’s Private Activity Bonds program is a tax-exempt financing option from the federal government aimed at supporting private-public partnerships. The program has financed bridge replacements, highways, rail lines and other transportation-related ventures. 
U.S. Supreme Court rules in favor of controversial Utah oil train 

That $2.4 billion is the total estimated cost for the project, according to the coalition, although it’s unclear how much money will come from private investments. 
But funds for the bond program are running dry. According to the department’s data, there’s only $500 million left to allocate, the program having dished out $29.4 billion of its $30 billion cap. It’s up to Congress to replenish the program. 
“How is the coalition going to get this money? And when?” asked Deeda Seed with the Center for Biological Diversity during the meeting Thursday. 
Seed also raised concerns over the “ballooning” cost of the railway, which has increased in the last few years. 
“How does this project pencil out? We have no clue, the public has no clue, especially when President Trump hopes the price of oil will decline to $40 to $50 per barrel,” she said. 
Just about all of the roughly two-dozen commenters on Thursday spoke against the railway, and using bonds to fund it — they cited concerns over the project’s rising cost, potential harm to wildlife and habitat, the negative impact on air quality, and how a derailment could harm the Colorado River and the people who rely on it for drinking water. 
“I deplore subsidizing the increase of oil production in the Uinta Basin, which will increase the ozone and air pollution, at a time when all federal subsidies are being cut for renewable energy,” said Joan Entwistle, a Summit County resident. “It’s just another example of how we’re putting the thumb on the scale for fossil fuels.” 
“The tariffs are being imposed at a level of 50% for steel. Clearly, that is going to raise the prices. Railroads are notorious for cost overruns,” said David Bennett, also a Summit County resident.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Alabama third grade students appeared to improve on a test of reading comprehension last year despite a slight increase in testing standards, according to numbers released by the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE) on Thursday.
According to the department, a smaller percentage of students who took the Alabama Comprehensive Assessment of Progress (ACAP) fell below the score considered “sufficient” for grade-level reading. The ALSDE said 13.7% of third graders fell below the mark, known as the cut-off score, in the 2024-25 school year. That was an improvement over the 2023-24 year, when 20.8% of third graders tested fell below the cut score. 
The state increased the cut score from 435 to 444 in October.

According to a Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama (PARCA) report, a student can score between 270 and 740 on the exam. 473 is the grade level score, but the lowered cut score allows for more statistical confidence that the correct students will be retained.
According to the data, 6,470 third-graders scored below 444 out of the 55,930 that were tested (11.57%). 
“If we take the current cut score and then apply it to last year’s data and the data before, you see that we would have seen growth,” Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey said during a meeting of the Alabama State Board of Education on Thursday. “So that tells me that not only do we have 11.6% below grade level, but we are seeing growth across the board.”
The 2019 Alabama Literacy Act requires students reading on grade level by the end of third grade. Students who fall short on the test and don’t meet an alternative requirement can be held back. The cut score will increase to 454 for the 2026-27 school year. 
The data also showed that 44 schools around the state had no students score below the 444 cut off on the test. Mackey said only two school systems had no students score below a 444.
“So we’re excited to see that,” he said. “A lot of them tested around the mid 90s, but we do have some districts that are around 70% still, and so we’re working on that.”
One of those systems was Orange Beach City Schools in Baldwin County. Randy Wilkes, the superintendent of the system, said in a statement the score reflects the dedication of the system’s teachers and leadership. This is the second year in a row the system had 100% of students scoring above the cut off, even with the increased cut score. 
“It’s a signal that every child in our district is being prepared for long-term academic success,” Wilkes said. “We believe that strong readers become strong learners. Our goal is not only to meet the standard but to set it.”
Satsuma City Schools in Mobile County was the other system to record all students reading at a sufficient level or higher. A message seeking comment from Superintendent Dana Price was left Thursday afternoon.
Although the number of students scoring above “sufficient” reading improved, Mackey said that the students between the cut score and grade-level scores are not necessarily proficient in reading. 
“They’re reading on grade level statistically, but they are so close that they could easily slip below grade level the next year. So we want parents to know that,” Mackey said. “We don’t want them to think that because their students were promoted to the fourth grade, that they’re in the clear.”
Montgomery County’s Chisholm Elementary School had the highest percentage of third grade students scoring below a 444 at 47.25%. The school reported testing 91 students, so 43 of those scored below the cut score. Huntsville City’s McDonnell Elementary School is the second lowest, with only 75 students tested, at 41.33% of students scoring below a 444. 
Bessemer City’s Charles F Hard Elementary School tested 55 students with 22 scoring below a 444, the third lowest percentage.

(Photo: Jennifer Solis/Nevada Current)Gov. Joe Lombardo in 2023 smashed the record for most vetoes during a single legislative sesseion, rejecting 75 bills. This year, he beat his own record, vetoing 87 bills as of Thursday evening. 
Lombardo himself was not on the ballot last year, but he and his affiliated political  action committee campaigned hard — and successfully — on the importance of getting enough Republicans elected to make sure Democrats would not have veto-proof majorities in the Legislature.
Lombardo vetoed legislation sponsored by Attorney General Aaron Ford to rein in price fixing earlier this week, as well as a pair of trans protections bills last week. Other notable vetos as of Thursday included: 

Assembly Bill 388, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch, would have required private employers with more than 50 workers, as well as all public employers, to provide paid family and medical leave. The bill, which was opposed by chambers of commerce, was amended to push the requirement to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2028. La Rue Hatch’s bill expanded legislative efforts in 2023, when lawmakers approved PFML for state employees. In his veto letter, Lombardo said the measure had ”broad, burdensome mandates” that would contradict the state’s “business-friendly environment”
Senate Bill 217  (Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, D) would establish the right to assisted reproduction treatment, including in vitro fertilization. The bill was a focus of Cannizzaro. 
Assembly Bill 112 (Assemblymember Duy Nguyen, D) would have allowed workers covered by collective bargaining agreements to use their accrued leave to care for family members. After passing the Legislature with some bipartisan support, Lombardo vetoed the bill, writing in his veto letter that it represented “yet another effort to mandate benefits for unionized employees outside the negotiation of their collective bargaining agreements, thereby undermining the integrity of those agreements.” In a policy hearing for the bill, union members said it is already common practice for members to use accrued leave to take care of their family but that they face potential discipline for doing so. With the veto, that will remain the status quo.
Assembly Bill 597 (Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, D) would have established semi-open primary elections allowing nonpartisan voters to request a Republican or Democratic ballot. The bill passed on the Assembly on party lines, with all Republicans opposing. In his veto letter, Lombardo said the legislation “would undermine the will of Nevada’s  voters,” who last year rejected an initiative to establish truly open primaries.
Assembly Bill 185 (Assemblymember Natha Anderson, D) would have barred most HOAs from prohibiting licensed home-based childcare operations within their communities. The bill received some bipartisan support. In his veto letter, Lombardo wrote “expanding access to child care is an important goal” but that the bill would “erode the integrity of HOA governance.”
Senate Bill 121 (State Sen. Dina Neal, D) would have made changes to what homeowners’ associations are allowed to require of new residents. The bill received some bipartisan support. Similar to his veto related to home-based childcare providers, Lombardo in his veto letter cited the importance of maintaining HOA autonomy.
Assembly Bill 209 (Assemblymember David Orentlicher, D) would have granted sex workers immunity from criminal liability from prostitution-related offenses when they call 911 seeking medical assistance. In his veto letter, Lombardo said the bill “codifies a lack of trust in law enforcement by assuming that sex workers fear prosecution more than they trust officers to prioritize their safety and the investigation of violent crimes.” An overwhelming lack of trust in law enforcement by sex workers who don’t believe law enforcement prioritizes their safety or humanity was the impetus for sponsoring the bill in the first place.
Senate Bill 350 (State Sen. James Ohrenschall, D) would have extended the time period the state has for carrying out an execution of someone on death row. Lombardo in his veto letter said the bill would “result in justice becoming even more elusive for victims and their families,” though he acknowledged it is currently virtually impossible for the state to execute anyone on death row.
Assembly Bill 411 (Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, D) would have allowed prescriptions for drugs used for medical abortions and miscarriage management to list the name of the prescribing health care practice, rather than the name of the specific individual providing the prescription. In his veto letter, Lombardo wrote that the bill may reduce transparency in clinical follow-up situations where identifying the prescribing providers quickly is crucial.
Assembly Bill 320 (Assemblymember Jovan Jackson, D) sought to stop judges from using dress codes to turn away defendants. In his veto letter, Lombardo said if enacted the bill “may infringe on the separation of powers by legislatively encroaching on the courts’ inherent authority to manage their proceedings.”
Assembly Bill 204 (Assemblymember Max Carter, D) would prevent collection agencies from threatening to arrest people for medical debt, obtain a lien against a primary residence, seek to foreclose on a home, or garnish wages. In his veto letter, Lombardo said if enacted the bill “would increase healthcare costs and undermine fairness by discouraging responsible payment.”
Assembly Bill 441 (Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, D) would change how  the state’s publicly financed private school scholarship program is administered. In his veto letter, Lombardo’s veto letter said the bill would “obstruct” the program.
Assembly Bill 597 (Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, D) would have established semi-open primary elections allowing nonpartisan voters to request a Republican or Democratic ballot. The bill passed on the Assembly on party lines, with all Republicans opposing. In his veto letter, Lombardo said the legislation “would undermine the will of Nevada’s  voters,” who last year rejected an initiative to establish truly open primaries.

Johnson nominated the first Black American, Thurgood Marshall, to the Supreme Court.","JUNE 13, 1967

President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated the first Black American, then-Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall, to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying it was “the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place.” 
But his push for a legal career began with disappointment. He wanted to attend the University of Maryland Law School, but the institution refused to open its doors to Black students. He wound up graduating first in his class at Howard University Law School. One of his first victories came against the University of Maryland, which had rejected a Black applicant on the basis of race alone. 
Attorney Charles Hamilton Houston began serving as his mentor when he became a staff lawyer for the NAACP in 1936. Four years later, Marshall founded and became the executive director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. At age 32, he won his first U.S. Supreme Court victory when justices overturned the convictions of four Black men in Florida who “confessed” after they were beaten. 
He went on to win an incredible 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the high court, most notably the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which ended racial segregation in schools. 
The Senate confirmed his nomination by a 69-11 margin, and he served a quarter century on the high court. He once described his legal philosophy as “you do what you think is right and let the law catch up” — a comment that drew him criticism. The law school at Texas Southern University now bears his name. 
In 2017, Chadwick Boseman portrayed the future justice in the movie, “Marshall,” featuring a 1940 case the NAACP lawyer took on, successfully representing a Black man accused of rape by a white socialite. 
Before his death, Marshall advised, “Where you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy. Make it. Protect it. Pass it on.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06104025/June27-FeatImage-update-Thurgood-Marshall.jpg,,,2025-06-13 08:56:58.589646
,California,2025-06-13 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s battle against homelessness needs a ‘combined arms’ approach,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-homelessness-battle-funding/,California is losing its war on homelessness because state and local governments are operating in political silos rather than combining their resources effectively.,"World War II was the most massive military conflict in recorded history and one that redefined effective military strategy, moving away from the static set-piece battles of previous wars and toward mechanization, speed and, most importantly, “combined arms.”
As military strategist William S. Lind has written, “Combined arms hits the enemy with two or more arms simultaneously in such a manner that the actions he must take to defend himself from one make him more vulnerable to another.”
Nazi Germany was an early adopter, allowing it to quickly sweep through Western Europe during the early months of the war. Despite having the world’s largest army at the time, France was committed to static defenses rather than rigorous offense and fell in just a few weeks.
Germany’s lesson was not lost on its foes, particularly Great Britain and the U.S. The allies’ adoption of combined arms led to victory in Europe and the Pacific War against Japan.
This bit of military history is offered because California is losing its war on homelessness, largely because state and local governments are operating in political silos rather than combining their resources effectively.
The state, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, has been providing funds for local efforts — about $1 billion a year — but Newsom complains incessantly that local governments aren’t spending the money effectively.
In turn, the locals complain that the state has given them only year-by-year allocations, making it impossible to create long-term programs to get homeless people off the streets and into housing and programs to alleviate their underlying issues.
However, local unity on seeking long-term financing breaks up when county and city officials bicker over who’s accountable for results. Homelessness is most visible in cities but counties operate health and social services programs.
The local infighting was so bad in Los Angeles County, which has nearly10 million residents, that a joint city-county homelessness agency, criticized for a lack of transparency and progress, was abandoned.
The squabbling over money and accountability seems to be increasing as homelessness and the public’s concern grow.
After months of complaining about local inaction and threatening penalties for failure, Newsom omitted the local allocation from the revised 2025-26 budget he unveiled in May, drawing a new chorus of complaints from local officials.
This week, in its version of the budget, legislative leaders also shunned a new allocation of funds but instead included weasel words of intention to give the locals $500 million — half the usual amount — sometime next year.
Not surprisingly, the California State Association of Counties immediately complained about the Legislature’s mealy-mouthed approach, as did the organization representing the state’s largest cities. The mayors of three Bay Area cities — San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland — weighed in as well.
“If the state wants to call homelessness a crisis, they need to treat it like one,” the mayors said in a public statement. “Cities like ours have been asked to lead — and we are. But here’s the truth: we cannot solve a statewide crisis if the state won’t show up.
“We’ve heard again and again that Sacramento doesn’t want to fund failure. Our answer: don’t abandon success.”
The counties’ criticism of the state budget’s semi-abandonment of local homelessness financing includes a suggestion that California adopt a combined arms approach in which the roles of the state, counties and cities are carefully delineated to reduce confusion over accountability and maximize effectiveness.
Unless something like that is adopted, homelessness will continue to confound and anger California’s voters while officials, from the governor down, merely point fingers of blame at each other.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/032323_SD_Encampment-Ban_KC_CM_11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-13 08:56:58.589646

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)A judge will hold a hearing later this month in a lawsuit filed by parents of children potentially eligible to receive medical cannabis under Alabama’s long-delayed program. 
The five parents — Dustin Chandler, Cristina Cain, Catherine Hall, Megan Jackson and Kari Forsyth — want the court to require the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission (AMCC) to establish a patient registry for medical cannabis, citing delays in access to the program.
“Plaintiffs also bring this petition in their individual capacities because they have suffered specific injuries as a result of the Commissioner’s failure to establish the patient and caregiver registry and seek to vindicate their own private rights,” the parents claimed in the lawsuit. The are also suing “in the name of the State of Alabama to uphold the Compassion Act’s requirement.”

The commission argued in a motion to dismiss filed in May that the lawsuit lacks standing and asks the AMCC to take steps already taken or beyond its control.
“The Commission applauds the early advocacy of those among the Petitioners who supported passage of the (Compassion Act). Regretfully, it appears the Petitioners have been misinformed about the status of the Patient Registry and why it has not yet been populated with the names of eligible patients,” counsel for AMCC wrote in the motion.
The plaintiffs said in their filing that each child “has a condition that is treatable with medical cannabis” but does not provide any further details. 
The AMCC states in the motion that a patient registry has, in fact, been established and is being maintained at a significant expense. But according to the motion to dismiss, no patients are currently registered because physicians cannot be certified until certain licensing requirements for cultivators, processors, transporters and dispensaries are met.
According to the AMCC’s filing, rules established by the Alabama Board of Medical Examiners (BME) dictate that physician certification is dependent on issuing at least one license in each of the licensing categories, or to one integrated facility.
“The Petitioners have not made the BME a party to this litigation, and the Commission has no control over its rules and restrictions,” according to AMCC’s filing.
The hearing is scheduled for June 26.

The program provides education and trade apprenticeships to low-income Americans ages 16 to 24. Nevada’s Job Corps center, in Reno, provides training for a wide range of trade fields including hospitality, construction, health care, and advanced manufacturing.
On Thursday, the entire Nevada federal delegation and Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo sent a letter to the Department of Labor demanding Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer halt any actions to defund or discontinue the Job Corps program.
Democratic U.S. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen signed onto the letter, as did Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, and Democratic Reps. Steven Horsford, Dina Titus, and Susie Lee. 
If the program ends, nearly 300 students and 170 staff members at the Sierra Nevada Job Corps Center will be displaced, according to the Nevada federal delegation and Lombardo. 
“The closure will also compel the Center to evict all of its students, leaving the vast majority at serious risk of homelessness,” reads the letter. 
Beyond job training and placement, the center provides affordable room and board for low-income students who may otherwise struggle to afford housing during career training.
According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the number of young people experiencing homelessness in Nevada increased by 14% from 2022 to 2023.
The Trump Administration’s budget request to Congress for the upcoming fiscal year calls Job Corps a “failed experiment to help America’s youth” and proposes ending the program that began in the 1960s. 
Last month, the Department of Labor said it was suspending the free high school and trade program due to a projected $213 million operating deficit this year. The agency criticized the effectiveness of the program, citing a 40% graduation rate at a cost of about $80,000 per student annually. 
Chavez-DeRemer, a former Job Corps champion, said it “is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve.”
Nevada’s governor and federal delegation disagreed with Chavez-DeRemer’s characterization, saying Jobs Corps has benefited “tens of thousands of unprivileged students, staff, and employers from throughout the state.”
In the letter, the Nevada federal delegation and Lombardo say the “Sierra Nevada Job Corps Center in Reno has been a vital economic engine for Northern Nevada, serving approximately 25,000 Nevadans since its opening, and graduating more than 500 vocational students a year.”
“In the 2024 program year alone, nearly 82 percent of its students secured full-time employment with a starting wage of at least $17.97 per hour — nearly $6 above Nevada’s minimum wage. Furthermore, 75 percent of Sierra Nevada Job Corps participants earn at least one certification required by employers,” the letter continues. 
A report released by the Labor Department’s Employment and Training Administration earlier this year analyzed the financial performance and operational costs, from 2023.
Chavez-DeRemer justified the elimination of the program citing the data, which found graduates go on to earn an average of about $16,700 a year, while graduates cost taxpayers about $160,000 per student.
In a press release, the Labor Department said the decision to end the program aligns with the Trump administration’s budget proposal to cut millions in spending “and reflects the administration’s commitment to ensure federal workforce investments deliver meaningful results for both students and taxpayers.”
Nevada’s federal delegation and Lombardo said they understand the department’s efforts “to increase accountability and bring workforce programs into alignment with the Administration’s priorities,” but disagree that cutting the program is the right move. 
“It will strip countless young people of the opportunity to gain valuable skills, education, and a pathway to stable employment. The ripple effects will be felt by local economies and employers who depend on Job Corps graduates to fill critical roles in industries such as construction, healthcare, information technology, and more,” reads the letter.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-6-12-25-at-8.19 PM-e1749784839724-1024x599.jpeg,,,2025-06-13 07:57:13.940846

Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) at the Mackinac Policy Conference, May 30, 2024 | Anna Liz NicholsFollowing the conclusion of his term in 2027, U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township) said he plans to remain active in public policy.
Earlier this year, Peters, who has served in the U.S. Senate since 2015, announced he would not seek reelection in 2026, to the shock of many.
While sitting down with the Michigan Advance at last month’s Mackinac Policy Conference, Peters said his post-Washington plans are still up in the air, but stressed that he’s not retiring.
“I’ll have a lot more control over my life when I’m not in the Senate, because it gives me a lot more flexibility to do a variety of things. But I’m going to stay active,” Peters said.

With a year and a half left in the Senate, Peters said he remains focused on the Great Lakes, specifically on securing funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and additional appropriations for the U.S. National Guard’s Great Lakes Oil Spill Center of Expertise in Sault Ste. Marie, which he helped establish.
Alongside serving in the U.S. Senate, Peters also chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2021 through 2025, with U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) taking over the role for the 2026 campaign cycle.
While Peter’s decision not to run for reelection created uncertainty for Democrats’ pathway back to a majority in the Senate, Peters said he’s confident his party will retain the seat.
“Actually, that was part of my decision, because I want to make sure that the seat continues to be Democratic,” he said, pointing to two key factors that he said give the Democrats good odds.
First, 2026 will be a good year to be a Democrat, Peters said, with the party out of power typically performing better during midterm elections.

“You have that historical precedent. Plus just the increased chaos we’re seeing out of the Trump administration will mean that people are going to be voting Democratic, and next year, I think you’re going to see that similar to what we saw in the last Trump administration,” Peters said, referencing the 2018 mid-term election where Democrats were able to take control of the U.S. House of Representatives.
In another benefit, Democrats also have a deep bench of candidates, Peters said, noting that while others may declare for candidacy, the four Democratic candidates that have already jumped into the race “are all very talented people.”
The Democratic slate is currently made up of U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed. Former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) is currently the only Republican candidate, however reports say U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) is also weighing a run, though he has yet to make a formal announcement.
That said, Democrats can’t take anything for granted as Michigan is set to be a top battleground state, Peters said.
“The challenge for a race – Senate race in particular – when you have a primary is that you don’t get your nominee till fairly late into August. And this race, it’ll go from zero to 100 miles an hour within hours of the election,” Peters said.
However, the 2024 election illustrated a clear divide in the Democratic Party between its moderate members and the more progressive wing, best illustrated by the party’s split over Israel and Gaza.
When looking for a pathway forward, Peters said Democrats need to remain focused on economic issues like affordable health care, job opportunities and voters’ ability to save for and live a dignified retirement.
“All those issues are the most powerful. And you should always be focused on those. And that’s not going to change,” Peters said.
When you think about the previous presidential election – where former Vice President Kamala Harris lost to Trump by just over 80,000 votes – a presidential loss would typically bring a Senate election loss with it, Peters said. However, that didn’t happen in Michigan.
“We won here in Michigan. And if you look at Elissa Slotkin’s campaign, it was focused on those bread and butter economic issues. We won Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, and Nevada and Arizona and all of those Senate candidates, that’s what they focused on. They outperformed the top of the ticket and they won,” Peters said.

Democrats still have to work to excite their base and cannot ignore them, but those economic issues are just as important to Democratic voters as they are to independents, Peters said.
As President Donald Trump works to radically reshape the federal government, congressional Democrats are tasked with both resisting the president and the Republican majority, and delivering results for their constituents.
While bringing home results for constituents is difficult, the Democratic minority has to use its position to call out Republicans’ actions and paint a contrast in the minds of voters, Peters said, emphasizing elections are all about contrast.
Trump has violated pretty much every major norm of democracy, alongside several laws, Peters said, and while the judicial system has repeatedly been a check on the president, Democrats need to be aggressive in calling that out.
“I think we definitely have to be extremely aggressive in calling out just the blatant corruption we’re seeing from the Trump administration,” Peters said, pointing to his decision to accept a $400 million jet as a gift from Qatar as well as his meeting with investors in his cryptocurrency business.
“We can’t normalize that in any way, not just for the short term of getting rid of President Trump, but we can’t normalize it for future administrations as well. The United States needs to be the place where corruption is never tolerated,” Peters said.
However, Democrats still need to walk and chew gum by retaining their focus on the economic issues, Peters said.
“I think those issues too are going to play out as we look at tariffs, which will increase costs. When people start paying more for the everyday goods that they have, they’re going to realize that Donald Trump’s promise that he was going to lower inflation on day one is not the case,” Peters said.
He also pointed to Republican’s tax and spending bill, warning the plan would increase the nation’s deficit by trillions of dollars, prompting higher interest rates.
“So you pay more for your car, you’re going to pay more for your mortgage, your credit card, all those costs as a result of what I believe is completely irresponsible fiscal policy from the Republicans right now,” Peters said.

As some Democrats have called on their officials to do more to resist the president, arguing they could do more to be a thorn in Trump’s side, Peters said Democratic lawmakers are using the tools they have.
While they’ve been able to use procedures to delay votes on legislation, those efforts are only delays, Peters said.
“We currently live, and I hope we always live, in a democracy and that means the majority rules in a democracy, yep. And if, if the majority have the votes, you can’t stop it,” Peters said, noting that Republicans were in a similar position during the first half of former President Joe Biden’s term.
This is where elections have consequences, Peters said, prompting Democrats to put their energy into next year’s election.
Given the current political circumstances, Peters predicts Democrats will take back control of the U.S. House in 2026. The chamber is currently split 220-212, with three open seats.
“When you take back the House, then the dynamic changes dramatically in Washington. And Donald Trump, we’ll be able to stop him, because he won’t be able to pass things through the House,” Peters said.
While retaking the Senate would prove more challenging, it’s not something Democrats can write off, Peters said. The chamber is currently split 53-45 with two independents Senators, Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.) and Angus King (D-Maine), caucusing with Democrats.
While he understands the frustration among activists, Peters reiterated Democrats’ limited options.

Apparently, Democratic governors, especially the California governor, have collectively opposed the President’s activation of thousands of National Guard members and 700 Marines in Los Angeles in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles.

He is a retired school social worker, a member of the Rural School Community Alliance and chair of the South Hero school board.


Taking off my school board hat and writing only as an individual today, I want to share my personal thoughts about what is really going on in Montpelier and the threat these current H.454 versions pose to Vermont’s long history of local school governance and setting spending budgets.
I agree with Sen. Brennan, Rep. Michael Morgan and Rep. Leland Morgan who all support keeping our Grand Isle County schools open. However, given the minimum school/district size requirements and new foundation model top-down funding restrictions in the H.454 bills under consideration, I just don’t see a viable path forward for keeping our three remaining (two closed) Grand Isle County schools open if the Legislature and governor approve some H.454 hybrid version.
Unless the governor or legislators can specifically explain how our local rural schools statewide can stay open under the restrictive provisions in an H.454 bill, we need to raise our voices and tell them to vote no and build a new plan based on impartial data-driven impact analysis. These schools are central to the future of  our communities.

I now believe that the primary objective of the H.454 bills based upon the governor’s original “education transformation” plan — actually an “education GOVERNANCE transformation” in disguise — has been to consolidate (close) small schools and to centralize state authority to cap statewide and new larger districts’ school spending.
Instead of local taxpayer (that’s you) control over school budgets, the state would tell each district exactly how much they could spend, regardless of their current needs. At least one proposal calls for future spending caps that are arbitrarily based on this year’s FY25 budgets!
Since these proposals are not based upon evidence of providing real tax relief or actual educational reform, the legislature should adjourn now and take the time necessary to design education plans which are evidenced based and meet the needs of Vermont as primarily a rural state with small towns.
Cost cutting required by the spending caps would have to come from impossible annual downsizing in staff to offset yearly double digit increases in healthcare premiums and inflationary increases in costs of goods and services. 
Even if we were given an exemption to a 4,000 student minimum district size to continue as a geographically isolated district or supervisory union, these massive financial pressures would drive small districts like ours into insolvency and force us to be folded into some larger district where we would not have a meaningful voice about keeping any schools open in our county.
In his Manchester Journal commentary, Lamoille South Supervisory Union Superintendent Ryan Heraty explains that the current bills under consideration by the conference committee this week don’t even offer the promised tax “relief” or educational “reform.”
What will your local school look like (if it is still there) after it is “transformed”?

District mergers, class size minimums and percentages of students in order to receive public funds and funding formulas are a distraction from the core issue that is plaguing Vermont’s education system.
Since the early 1990s, we have been operating two parallel educational systems — public and private — both funded by taxpayer dollars, yet governed by dramatically different rules under one diminished Agency of Education to oversee them. Until Vermont creates one unified education system, no other meaningful education reform can happen.
The current structure allows independent schools to operate with significantly less oversight and accountability compared to public schools. A 2020 report from State Auditor Doug Hoffer highlighted that public schools face stringent transparency requirements while independent schools are exempt from public meetings, financial information disclosure, budget voter approval and public records accessibility.

On a recent Vermont Edition, Vermont Public education and youth reporter Lola Duffort called independent schools “the Achilles’ heel of any reform effort in Vermont.” Any attempt to create parity between the two school systems is met with fierce resistance from the private school lobby and reform efforts break down.  
Successive legislative efforts like Act 46 and Act 173 have repeatedly failed to address the fundamental structural issues.  Act 46 forced “like” operating  districts to merge while leaving choice districts untouched and Act 173 created financial incentive structures that disadvantage public schools.
And just recently the conference committee negotiations collapsed due to last minute efforts by senators to ensure concessions to benefit independent school interests.
To truly reform Vermont’s education system, we must abandon the current negotiations around H.454 and instead create a single, unified educational framework that establishes uniform standards for all schools receiving public funding, require choice towns to designate a school that will take every student from the community, require all schools taking public dollars to follow education quality standards, and strengthen the Agency of Education’s oversight capabilities.  
Vermont cannot continue to maintain two separate and unequal educational systems. The time for meaningful, comprehensive reform is now.
Once we have one system, we can focus on addressing the core challenges of affordability and equity of instruction.

Mike Lee, right, participates in a forum hosted by the Sutherland Institute at the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics in 2024. (Photo: Katie McKellar, Utah News Dispatch)Utah Sen. Mike Lee is bringing back a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Nevada, Utah and other Western states.
Lee says it will open up “underused” federal land for housing and help communities manage growth — opponents, including a number of Democrats in Congress and environmental groups, say it’s an attempt to pay for tax cuts and warn it will jeopardize access to public lands.
Introduced Wednesday evening, Lee’s amendment to congressional Republicans’ budget bill, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill,” renews an effort initially spearheaded by Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, and Mark Amodei, R-Nevada, that sought to dispose of 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah and some 450,000 acres of federal land in Nevada.
But Lee’s proposal is much broader — rather than earmark specific parcels of land for disposal like Maloy and Amodei’s amendment, Lee wants to require the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture to sell off a percentage of land managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
According to the amendment, both agencies would be required to dispose of between 0.5% to 0.75% of land they manage, which amounts to about 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. State and local governments would be allowed to nominate parcels of land, and would be granted priority to purchase.
Eleven states would be eligible — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Notably, Montana is exempt, and Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke was instrumental in sinking Maloy and Amodei’s original proposal, stating that selling public lands is a line he would not cross.
Though the scope is much bigger, Lee’s reasoning behind the proposal is the same as Maloy and Amodei’s — identify parcels of federal land near high-growth areas, and sell them at market value to local governments to use for housing, water infrastructure, roads and other development.
The amendment prohibits the sale of land that’s already designated, like national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas or national recreation areas. Land that has an existing right, like a mining claim, grazing permit, mineral lease or right of way is also off limits.
If it passes, the secretaries of the departments of interior and agriculture would have to prioritize nominating land that’s next to already developed areas, has access to existing infrastructure or is “suitable for residential housing.” The amendment also directs the secretaries to nominate land that’s isolated and “inefficient to manage,” and to reduce the checkerboard land pattern, the result of railroad grants in the 1800s that left small plots of private land scattered within swaths of federal land and vice-versa.
“We’re opening underused federal land to expand housing, support local development and get Washington, D.C. out of the way for communities that are just trying to grow,” Lee said in a video address. “We’re talking about isolated parcels that are difficult to manage, that are better suited for housing and infrastructure. To our hunters, anglers and sportsmen, you will not lose access to the lands you love. Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands.”
Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto slammed Lee’s proposal after it was introduced, saying it was developed without input from Nevadans.
Lee’s proposal  “ignores provisions for affordable housing and eliminates funding Nevada relies on for our schools and water conservation projects,” Cortez Masto said in a statement. “Shoving lands sales in a reconciliation bill in order to pay for tax cuts for billionaires is not the way forward, and I’ll continue to fight against this misguided proposal.”
Lee’s proposal also didn’t fly for a number of environmental groups, including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, which called it an attempt “to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”
“Senator Lee’s never-ending attacks on public lands continue. His hostility stands in stark contrast with Americans’ deep and abiding love of public lands. Senator Lee’s plan puts Utah’s redrock country in the crosshairs of unchecked development,” said Travis Hammill, Washington, D.C. director for the alliance. “In Utah and the West, public lands are the envy of the country — but Senator Lee is willing to sacrifice the places where people recreate, where they hunt and fish, and where they make a living.”
The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, called Lee’s amendment “a shameless ploy to sell off pristine public lands for trophy homes and gated communities that will do nothing to address the affordable housing shortage in the West”; the National Wildlife Federation dubbed it a “fire sale” that is “orders of magnitude worse” than Maloy’s proposal; The Wilderness Society said it was “a betrayal of future generations and folks on both sides of the aisle” and warned that could spark political backlash.

(Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A newly constituted Indiana University Board of Trustees on Thursday changed the school’s protest policy related to a federal lawsuit after Gov. Mike Braun’s three new appointees were sworn in. 
Other topics included new degree programs, tuition and fees, and a legislative update.
The governor recently removed three alumni-elected board members in favor of his own appointees after lawmakers gave him the new powers earlier this year. Two IU alumni silently held signs at the back of the room, urging President Pamela Whitten to sign a resolution by the American Association of Colleges and Universities condemning political interference in higher education. A third alum joined, standing for the entire session in protest of state overreach into university governance. 
The public meeting, held on IU Bloomington’s campus, began with the swearing in of Braun’s newly appointed trustees – sports reporter Sage Steele, conservative attorney James Bopp, Jr. and attorney Brian Eagle.
“Now that we have you, let’s put you to work,” said Board Chairman Quinn Buckner. 
Expressive Activity Policy 
The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana has filed multiple lawsuits against IU over the last year. One of those challenged IU’s expressive activity policy, claiming the time restrictions on when students can protest violate the First Amendment. 
IU’s general counsel said they incorporated feedback from the university and the judge overseeing the lawsuit to make new amendments. The board unanimously passed the changes made to the policy, although the exact amendments were not discussed.

The Expressive Activity Policy webpage has since changed and no longer includes the contested time restrictions on protests. The only trustee to make comments during discussion was Bopp, who praised the new amendments and mentioned he once protested at Dunn Meadow as an IU student. 
“It’s a hallowed ground, as far as I’m concerned.” Bopp said. 
Tuition, degrees
The board also unanimously approved the tuition and fee proposals for the 2025-2027 academic years — despite a $60 million cut from the state budget. 
IU Chief Financial Officer Jason Dudich presented a two-year tuition freeze proposal for in-state tuition. But tuition for out-of-state undergraduate students will increase by 1%, and graduate programs will increase by 2%, with the exception of certain medical and health fields. 
The trustees also approved IU’s 2026 fiscal year budget, which includes a 2% salary increase for faculty and staff, eliminates select unfilled positions to target reductions, limits operational expenses, and takes back support for non-academic programs. 
IU Provost Rahul Shrivastav presented seven new degree programs that were all unanimously approved by the board, too. The new programs are: 

B.S. in Computer Engineering 
B.S. in Global Media 
B.S. in Media Advertising 
B.S. in Public Relations 
M.S. in Media Leadership and Business
B.S. in Business Intelligence and Data Science
B.S. in Biomedical Sciences (IU Indy School of Science)

Bopp continued his vocal participation in the meeting, questioning the cost of the new programs and if they mesh with recent Indiana legislative changes. He also at times pushed for more transparency on policy changes. 
Lawmakers passed language during the 2025 legislation to limit the number of programs based on degrees being conferred. 
Bopp asked if there had been any recommendations to terminate degree programs. Shrivastav said the school is still working out how many programs are likely to be cut. IU has to report by June 23 on how many degree programs are at risk, Bopp said. 
Navigating federal and state policy 
Vice President for University Relations Michael Huber said IU is among the most competitive institutions for federal research funding. However, he’s concerned that proposed federal budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and federal student aid could jeopardize IU’s research. 
“The biggest concern down the road is federal funding,” Huber said.
The board also heard a legislative update and approved updates to 26 policies to ensure compliance with new state legislation. Several university policies have already been revised on IU’s website.

CHICAGO — For most new parents, finding last-minute child care usually means an afternoon of frantic phone calls and around $100 dropped on a trusted babysitter.

For Brian and Fiona Peterman, it means walking across their backyard.

In 2021, Fiona’s mother, Louise D’Agostino, was scanning pricey apartments near Brian and Fiona’s Lakeview home so she could live closer to them after she retired — until Brian learned about a new city program that would let the family build a second, smaller house on their own property.

After nearly two years of navigating regulatory red tape and approximately $300,000 in construction costs, D’Agostino was able to move into a 700-square-foot, two-bedroom house on top of Peterman’s garage in 2023.



After nearly two years of navigating regulatory red tape and approximately $300,000 in construction costs, Brian Peterman was able to build a ""granny flat"" on his property, allowing his mother-in-law to move in. “‘Life-changing’ is probably the cleanest way of saying it,” he said. (Akilah Townsend for Illinois Answers Project)


Nowadays, D’Agostino goes on walks with her 18-month-old granddaughter nearly every day. D’Agostino cooks the toddler recipes from her native Malta that she learned from her own mother, and she’s teaching her to speak Maltese.

D’Agostino pays rent to her daughter, Fiona, and son-in-law, Brian — much less than the cost of the mortgage at her previous home, but still a steady and meaningful source of income for the Petermans to supplement the salaries from their day jobs.

“‘Life-changing’ is probably the cleanest way of saying it,” Brian Peterman said. “By having her there, we always have that backup plan in case something goes awry in our normal lives.”

Homes like D’Agostino’s, typically called coach houses, carriage houses or “granny flats,” are illegal to build in most of Chicago. Their construction was banned in 1957 by city leaders who feared residential overcrowding. Chicago has since lost approximately 800,000 residents.

City officials under three mayors have been pushing for at least six years to unravel the prohibition of so-called accessory dwelling units, or ADUs — a term used to describe both coach houses and unused basement or attic spaces that are converted into apartments. In the legalization campaign, bureaucrats and policy researchers consistently highlight ADUs as a low-risk tool, free to taxpayers, that’s been proven to provide a limited but effective release valve for other cities’ affordable housing crises.

For D’Agostino, it meant finding an affordable home in an affluent neighborhood while providing extra income to offset child care costs for her daughter and son-in-law while keeping her granddaughter close.

A three-year pilot program that legalized the units in some areas showed that outcomes like the Petermans’ are widely replicable, opening up more housing options in neighborhoods where cheap apartments have become increasingly rare. But the burst of construction seen so far is a pittance compared to the more than 100,000 affordable units experts say it would take to satisfy demand.

“ADUs are our path to economic mobility,” said state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-Chicago), who sponsored legislation that would prohibit Illinois cities from banning the units. “They turn under-utilized space into income-generating property, which is a big deal.”

Many City Council members remain skeptical of ADU legalization, wary of any move that would limit their ability to guide new development in their wards.

That’s one reason why a proposal to legalize the units citywide has been sitting on the shelf for more than a year.

In the meantime, property owners inside the pilot zones, like the Petermans, are straining to build ADUs amid daunting costs and regulatory barriers.

City Hall discussions on how to expand and ease construction are clouded by a political stalemate over how far the program should reach, and by a little-understood federal complaint targeting Chicago’s housing segregation. And policymakers have struggled to craft an ordinance that would encourage ADU construction across the city — not just in wealthy, dense areas, where they’ve overwhelmingly been added during the pilot.

As Chicago leaders sit on their hands, proposals to permit ADU construction across Illinois are gaining support in Springfield, where lawmakers are pushing their own measures. Adding to the momentum is Gov. JB Pritzker, who recently endorsed ADUs as a tool to increase the state’s stock of affordable housing.

“Think about carriage houses,” Pritzker said in an April 30 episode of the Volts podcast after an interviewer asked the governor about his housing agenda. “We’ve got neighborhoods where people are not allowed to have those as separate dwellings — or just the idea that we can, if we make a few tweaks here and there, we can significantly increase the amount of housing with the existing housing stock.”

A pilot program to test the waters

Chicago planning officials under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel first promoted the idea of legalizing accessory dwelling units in 2018, saying they “can offer relatively affordable housing for tenants and can help moderate income families become homeowners with the additional income.” Researchers had taken note of new construction in Portland following the legalization of ADUs there years earlier, and a 2016 California law had already unlocked an explosion in construction of the relatively low-cost units across that state.

A 2019 study by the AARP found that in seven U.S. cities, ADU rents were hundreds of dollars lower than the rents of comparable one-bedroom apartments and could provide “a substitute for nursing home care, a means to age in community, an opportunity to live with other family members in multi-generational living arrangements, as well as a source of earning extra income to supplement fixed incomes in their retirement years.”

In 2019, the newly reconstituted Chicago Department of Housing recruited the Chicago-based Urban Land Institute to lead a task force with dozens of developers, architects, affordable housing advocates and lenders to draw up a list of recommendations for how Chicago could legalize ADUs.

The result was a 44-page report, published in May 2020, detailing the challenges of ADU legalization in other cities and ways Chicago could overcome them.

Within a month of the report’s publication, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot had introduced an ordinance legalizing coach house construction and basement unit conversions in Chicago, incorporating some of the task force’s recommendations.

It got a chilly reception in the City Council.

“This will be a blanket approval … it will allow two-flats to become three-flats, three to become four and four to become five,” said then-Ald. Patrick Daley Thompson (11th), who represented the city’s Bridgeport and Chinatown neighborhoods. “If someone wants to change a two-flat to a three-flat, in my ward, we do a community meeting. All of my neighbors — the community comes out and has participation. Not a bureaucrat at City Hall making a decision for my community.”

South Side Ald. David Moore (17th) was more direct.

“I want some aldermanic control over this,” Moore said.

After months of negotiations, the council approved a test ordinance that legalized accessory dwelling ordinance in five “pilot zones” — two on the city’s North Side, one on the West Side and two on the South Side — all in areas represented by alderpeople who supported the initiative. However, the West and South Side zones were established with additional restrictions at local council members’ request, including a requirement that the new units could  be built only on owner-occupied properties.

In May 2021, the Chicago Department of Housing began accepting applications for coach houses and basement unit conversions. The ordinance called on city officials to report back to the City Council three years later with data and insights.

Peterman, who had been following the ordinance closely, was among the first in line to apply.

It was  a year before his coach house project would break ground.

Peterman became tangled in a weeks-long back-and-forth with zoning officials in the city planning department over the dimensions of his porch. Because the city requires homes like his to have at least one parking space, he needed to figure out how to build the coach house on top of his garage. And even after housing and planning officials gave him the go-ahead, he had to get a fresh approval from the Chicago Department of Buildings, which regulates all construction in the city.

(Akilah Townsend for Illinois Answers Project)


“It took us a very long time compared to a normal [housing] permit, which would have been one-tenth of the time if [the ADU] was already part of the zoning code,” he said.

Just as difficult, Peterman said, was financing. It typically takes between $50,000 and $100,000 to build a new unit in a basement or attic, but building a new coach house can run upwards of $250,000. Peterman and his wife had so much difficulty finding a loan package that they ultimately took out a new line of credit on their existing home to pay for the project, he said.

Despite the hurdles, more than 300 accessory dwelling units have been permitted for construction across the five pilot zones since 2021. They overwhelmingly comprised basement unit conversions, as opposed to coach houses — not surprising, observers said, considering how much cheaper it is to renovate than to build a new free-standing structure.

﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿


More than 90% of the new units were located in one of the two North Side zones. City officials chalked up the disparity to the overwhelming demand for new housing in wealthier parts of the city — and to the added barriers placed on construction in the South and West Side zones.

‘We need them in our neighborhoods’

A May 31, 2024 memo sent to the City Council by commissioners of the Chicago planning and housing departments recommended expanding the pilot citywide. A review of data found that most of the new construction in the pilot program added garden units below existing walk-up apartment buildings. The below-grade units are typically less costly to rent.

Cook County faces a shortage of more than 150,000 affordable homes — in large part due to the disappearance of apartments in two- to four-unit apartment buildings that have either been demolished or converted into lavish single-family homes in recent years, according to the DePaul University Institute for Housing Studies.

As a result, a renter who earns the median income in Chicago today has sharply fewer housing options than they would have had 25 years ago, a WBEZ investigation found earlier this year.

Chicago’s ADU pilot has seen hundreds of units crop up in neighborhoods made up of squat two- and three-story apartment buildings, showing that their legalization has been “spurring investment in exactly the kind of neighborhood type where added housing options are most badly needed,” city commissioners wrote in their memo to the City Council.

The results of the ADU pilot were promising, but they were also underwhelming in the context of the city’s mammoth affordable housing crisis, said Daniel Hertz, who served as director of policy, research and legislative affairs for the Chicago Department of Housing from 2019 to 2024.

“It hasn’t completely transformed the face of any neighborhood,” Hertz said. “But I think 300 additional units that by and large are going to be moderately priced for the neighborhoods that they’re in … and having done that without basically any subsidy from the city — that’s a good thing.”

Ald. Daniel La Spata (1st), whose ward is inside the Northwest Side pilot zone, was an early supporter of accessory dwelling unit legalization. What he’s seen during the pilot has been “fantastic,” solidifying his position on the policy, he said.

“I’ve been in these units. They’re great. We need them in our neighborhoods,” La Spata said. “They’ve allowed families to develop and stay together intergenerationally.”

AARP Illinois, which supported Chicago’s ADU pilot ordinance, has since thrown its weight behind efforts to allow construction of the units statewide. A spokesperson for the seniors’ advocacy group said the housing type can provide an ideal option for older Illinoisans who want to live independently while downsizing to a smaller, more affordable home.

AARP found in its 2019 study that the average ADU in Seattle rented for $1,500, compared to nearly $1,900 for a comparable one-bedroom apartment in the same city. The price difference was even sharper in Oakland, Calif. and Washington, D.C.

Proponents argue the financial benefits of ADUs also apply to Chicago.

La Spata noted that the city spends millions of dollars each year to subsidize housing for people with low incomes. Legalizing basement unit conversions, assuming a $100,000-per-unit cost by private developers, represents an easy and efficient way to bring more affordable units into the market without spending taxpayer money, La Spata said.

“If I told someone tomorrow that we could develop 50 units of affordable housing for all of a $5 million investment, that would be the most efficient affordable housing development in the city,” he said.

La Spata supports a proposal from Ald. Bennett Lawson (44th), whose Lakeview ward straddles a pilot zone, to legalize the units across the city.

The addition of new ADUs in Lawson’s ward has “really worked out well,” Lawson said. The new units haven’t drawn any complaints from neighbors or worsened traffic or parking.

“A lot of them are legalizing spaces that were never properly permitted … and making that housing legal and safe for more people in my neighborhood,” the North Side alderperson added.

Lawson met some resistance to the proposal among his colleagues, but he tweaked the ordinance in April 2024 with a compromise that would add an additional hurdle to approval in low-density residential neighborhoods on the city’s outskirts.

Lawson said he believed the amended ordinance had ample support in the City Council and could pass easily if taken to the floor.

A year later, the ordinance remains on the shelf.

Delays and disputes gum up legislation

Lawson’s proposal can’t move forward until Ald. Walter Burnett (27th), who chairs the City Council Committee on Zoning, brings it to a vote.

Burnett is holding the proposal back. But not because he’s against the policy.

He said the hold-up is coming from Mayor Brandon Johnson’s administration.

The housing and planning departments under the mayor rejected Lawson’s proposal, saying its built-in hurdles for construction in less dense neighborhoods make it too restrictive. Instead, the Johnson Administration is pushing for zoning that allows ADU construction in every corner of the city.

“Allowing ADUs by right is essential to meaningfully addressing Chicago’s housing shortage and building on the success of the pilot program,” Chicago Department of Housing spokesperson Felicia Bolton wrote in a statement.

Burnett also blamed the delay on an obscure legal snag.

In 2019, a coalition of fair housing groups led by the Shriver Center on Poverty Law filed a legal complaint with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development alleging that “aldermanic prerogative,” the unwritten rule that gives Chicago alderpeople vast power to dictate zoning changes and other approvals in their own wards, stymies proposals for new affordable housing in well-to-do neighborhoods. The case led federal officials in 2023 to send Chicago leaders a letter ruling that local aldermanic veto power violates federal civil rights law because it “perpetuates segregation” and “effectuates opposition to affordable housing based on racial animus.”

Nearly two years later, the plaintiff groups and city officials all declined to comment on the status of the legal complaint, saying they agreed to stay quiet while the parties negotiate a mutual resolution to the complaint.

Burnett blamed the grinding legal talks for freezing progress on citywide legalization of accessory dwelling units. City attorneys told the zoning committee chair that Lawson’s compromise ordinance, with its added regulations for low-density neighborhoods, would complicate the path to a legal resolution by opening a new avenue for the “aldermanic prerogative” that the plaintiffs are seeking to roll back.

“The law department were the ones that said, ‘hold off until we get past this lawsuit,’” Burnett said.

Chicago Department of Law spokesperson Kristen Cabanban wrote in a statement that city and federal officials are “negotiating a resolution to a complaint regarding the distribution of affordable housing throughout the city.” She declined to comment on the status of the negotiations or on Burnett’s characterization of them.

If city leaders delay on the ordinance much longer, their efforts could be eclipsed by pending state legislation that aims to allow coach houses and basement units across Illinois.

Buckner’s proposal, which would pair a ban on local prohibition of accessory dwelling units with a list of measures designed to boost their construction, missed a key deadline for consideration in the spring 2025 legislative session. But the legislator is also supporting a parallel legalization bill, backed by the powerful trade association Illinois Realtors, that cleared a key committee vote and remains in contention.

“I just hope we can put a little fire under them,” Buckner said of his counterparts on the Chicago City Council. “I want the city to lead this conversation — I really don’t want the state to have to do this. But we will, if we need to.”



After nearly two years of navigating regulatory red tape and approximately $300,000 in construction costs, Brian Peterman was able to build a ""granny flat"" on his property, allowing his mother-in-law to move in. “‘Life-changing’ is probably the cleanest way of saying it,” he said. (Akilah Townsend for Illinois Answers Project)


Peterman has become a vocal advocate for the legislation, even opening up his home to show Buckner and other state representatives how an ADU can work. He hopes statewide legalization of coach houses helps more families move closer together into affordable homes just like his mother-in-law did.

Legalizing the units in some parts of Chicago “has not changed the character of these neighborhoods,” Peterman said. “All it has done is given people more options for the property that they already own.”

(Getty Images)Five years after seemingly everything went online during a pandemic, governments are still wrestling with how to make public meetings more accessible. And a July 1 deadline looms around the corner.
Livestreaming is an important way to keep Hoosiers informed about decisions being made at all levels of government. And many city council meetings and state events have long been online.
But with new technology also comes new concerns.
Take the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency, for instance. It had been regularly livestreaming meetings of various professional groups — from doctors and surveyors to nurses and plumbers. Some of the boards even allowed Hoosiers who needed to appear before them do so remotely. That saved upwards of five hours of travel a day for some residents.
But then so-called Zoom bombings, which also came over WebEx, started to occur more regularly. We wrote about it in March.
Porn, hate content
The “isolated incidents” occurred during various professional licensing board, commission and committee meetings beginning in October 2024. Pornographic content was displayed during three incidents and KKK imagery was displayed during one.
At the time, state officials said the incidents could be prevented and sent out reminders to all board, committee, and commission directors and assistant directors to enable the appropriate security settings when starting meetings.
But four months later and there are still no livestreams or remote attendance for the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency. That led to one member of the Indiana Pharmacy Board to express frustration at a recent meeting.
“As the consumer advocate on our board, I believe we are doing the public a disservice by not resolving this issue swiftly,” Kate Snedeker said. “Requiring in-person attendance — especially for working families, caregivers, or out-of-state stakeholders — creates unnecessary barriers to civic participation and transparency. We should be making it easier, not harder, for people to engage with the decisions that directly affect their lives and businesses.”
She said other states have figured it out.
“Reinstating secure Zoom access isn’t about convenience — it’s about equity and trust. When stakeholders have to take off work, arrange child care, or fly in from Texas for a 10-minute agenda item, we send the wrong message about accessibility and transparency and our willingness to serve the public.”
Emily Cox, assistant director of communications for the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency, confirmed that all PLA meetings were moved to being held in-person only because of the disruptions but promised that “streaming will return by July 1 as required.”
Deadline approaching
That brings me now to the July 1 deadline not only for the state, which theoretically should have more resources and expertise, but for local government.
A recent Indianapolis Business Journal article looked at the challenges some are facing to meet a law passed in 2023. It requires state and local governments to begin livestreaming, recording and archiving meetings. The law covers public meetings held by state boards and commissions; elected school boards; county commissions; and county, city and town councils.
Any other meetings held in the same room as those entities — such as a city plan commission or a board of zoning appeals — will also need to be livestreamed.
I think the move ensures Hoosiers remain a part of the process. It is especially helpful for those working or who are physically unable to make it to meetings.
But I would go further and recommend the General Assembly take the next step in accessibility.
The Legislature set the standard more than a decade ago by streaming its daily sessions and then committee hearings. But not allowing remote testimony is still a missed opportunity.
Lawmakers didn’t even allow it during the 2021 session dominated by Covid-19, and still required that Hoosiers trek to the Statehouse to have their say.
Livestreaming is about access and accountability, and both should be treated as equally important.

The cost could drive some out of business, a manager says.","A new regulation requires operators of sober living homes to have paid staff on site overnights. (Photo by New Jersey Monitor)Sober living homes are life-saving for individuals who are in recovery. For some, it’s the first stable and supportive place they may have ever lived. However, a recent change to how these sober homes are regulated here in New Jersey may put many of them out of business, and put the lives and recoveries of hundreds at risk.
Cooperative sober living residences — or “sober homes” — are residential properties that house those suffering from substance use disorder. Residents in these homes are required to remain drug and alcohol free, and live together while they attend 12-step meetings and work in the community. The concept is simply to create a substance-free, self-supporting environment. Residents pay rent, work, and live together like a family. There is no treatment at the residential home, as residents have already completed inpatient rehabilitation elsewhere.
Unfortunately, effective Jan. 6, 2025, a major change occurred that substantially threatens cooperative sober living residences licensed by the state of New Jersey. It requires that operators of sober homes must now have paid staff on site at the homes from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. — a rule that makes no sense, considering these homes are not treatment facilities, nor halfway houses, nor group homes. They are households just like any other, whose operators and residents happen to be supporting each other in their recovery. In a perfect world, it would be great to have a house manager. But without additional funding to make that happen, this rule might financially ruin many of the already few sober houses in New Jersey.
This change was made by regulation, not voted on by the legislature, and without input from recovery advocates, cooperative sober living residence operators, or stakeholders. It will raise costs for owners and operators of these homes substantially and put many homes out of business. Because there is no insurance coverage or government funding for these homes, the additional costs will need to be covered by the resident or their family at a time inflation and utilities are already affecting prices.
Most residents at sober homes begin their recovery journey with major economic challenges. Rent at sober homes averages about $800 a month, and because family members, nonprofits, and friends often help with initial rent payments, many individuals without support already don’t have the means to live in these life-saving homes.
People in recovery will lose their places to live, and more people looking to continue their recovery journey will be priced out altogether. It is clear that the Murphy administration simply does not understand the basic premises and focus of these homes.

Thomas/Getty Images).June is a significant time for men’s health.
In addition to Father’s Day on Sunday, June is both Men’s Health Month and Men’s Mental Health Month, and includes both Juneteenth and LGBTQ Pride. All this provides a great opportunity to reflect on the challenges that men and boys face and how we can better support their health and well-being.
And it should be more than just celebrating fathers or reminding men to get their check-ups. We must take a closer look at how our state and society are supporting the lives of boys and men and consider whether Missouri is ready to take a new step by establishing a Commission on Boys and Men.
A growing conversation is taking place across the country.
In community meetings, classrooms, and places of worship, people are quietly naming a set of challenges that have been building for years. Nationally, boys are struggling in school. Young men are disconnected from work or education. Fathers are trying to stay involved but feeling shut out by systems. Men experiencing mental health crises in silence.
These are not new problems, but we are finally starting to acknowledge them out loud. These stories cross racial, economic and geographic lines. And they matter – not just for the people involved, but for families and communities who need boys and men to be healthy, present and supported.
A statewide Commission on Boys and Men would allow Missouri to examine these same issues through a community-based lens. We could begin to chart a path forward by gathering data, listening deeply, and elevating voices. The commission would bring together researchers, community leaders, practitioners, and people with lived experiences to study the challenges boys and men face and recommend impactful solutions.
The commission would ask questions that too often go unspoken in policymaking: How do we help young boys thrive in schools? How do we better support fathers who are struggling? What would it look like to create mental health services that men are more likely to use?
The State of Missouri has councils, committees, and departments that help children, women, veterans and older adults. These organized groups recognize the importance of addressing specific needs and developing solutions tailored to these populations. A commission focused on boys and men would help fill a gap in how we understand and respond to urgent issues.
To be clear:  Supporting boys and men doesn’t mean turning away from the needs of women and girls.
In fact, the health and well-being of men is closely connected to the health of families and communities. When boys are supported in school, it creates better classroom environments for everyone. When men are healthier and more emotionally engaged, their partners and children benefit. When fathers are involved, children are more likely to do well across a range of outcomes.
To achieve this goal, we must accept that things can be complex. We have to be willing to talk about gender and identity, social isolation, economic shifts and generational trauma – without judgment, but with respect and compassion.
We have to ask what it means for men to seek help, express emotions, and build relationships in a culture that has not always encouraged them to do so. And we have to be ready to design policies that reflect these complex realities.
Other states and cities have already started this work. The State of Washington has a grassroots campaign to pass legislation. California established a Select Committee on the Status of Boys and Men of Color in 2011. Cities like Washington, D.C. and Boston have launched initiatives to support boys and men.
And this year, the Missouri House passed legislation to establish the “Missouri Fathership Project” with the state social services department to promote fathership and empower fathers to become successful in fathership, though the bill died in the Senate.
Missouri could be among the first states in the Midwest to take this seriously, to say, “We see you. We hear you. And we are committed to understanding what’s happening and what needs to change.”
As we observe Father’s Day and Men’s Health Month, we have an opportunity to shift the narrative. We can create a new story. To move beyond short-term programs and one-off initiatives and toward a more intentional, informed, and inclusive approach. A Commission on Boys and Men wouldn’t just be a policy win. It would be a turning point.
Maybe this June, in between cookouts and celebrations, we can take a moment to ask: What would it look like to truly support boys and men in Missouri? And what might change if we tried?
That’s a question worth exploring. And a commission could help us find the answers.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1230641753.jpg,,,2025-06-13 06:56:42.462802

(Photos courtesy of candidates)The Democratic Party of Wisconsin will meet over the weekend with the task of choosing a new party chair who will lead the party into 2026 when crucial elections are at stake. 
Those elections include a nominally nonpartisan state Supreme Court race that could nonetheless lock in a liberal majority past 2028, campaigns for competitive congressional seats, the governor’s race and state legislative races that will determine the balance of power in the state Legislature, where Democrats have a chance to flip both the Senate and Assembly for the first time in over a decade.
The state party has been led by Ben Wikler since 2019. He’s credited with helping transform the party through fundraising and with being instrumental in many wins including electing Gov. Tony Evers to a second term, gaining back ground in the state Legislature and flipping the ideological balance of the state Supreme Court, though the party has also had some close losses under him with President Donald Trump winning the state last November and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson winning a third term in office. The state party had started considering who could fill the position earlier in the year when Wikler campaigned for Democratic National Committee chair in February, though some thought he’d remain after he lost.
Wikler announced in April that he wouldn’t be running for another term as chair, saying it was time to “pass the torch.” 
Three candidates with slightly varied visions are running for the position: Devin Remiker, a party insider from Reedsburg who has worked in leadership roles in the party since 2018; Joe Zepecki, a Milwaukee-based Democratic communications professional, and William Garcia, the 3rd Congressional District chair and co-chair of the La Crosse County Democratic Party.
Party insider wants to fine-tune party 
Remiker said he initially wasn’t sure he would have the energy to be chair but that Susan Crawford’s victory in her state Supreme Court race changed that. 
“It was just a really good reminder of why we do this and why it’s important, so I sort of switched gears pretty quickly,” Remiker said, adding that some people were encouraging him to run. 
Remiker, a 32-year-old New Rivers native, most recently served as a senior advisor for the state party. He is currently on a leave of absence during his campaign. He first joined the Democratic Party of Wisconsin as a staffer in 2018 and has worked up from there. He served as a senior advisor to the Biden-Harris and then Harris-Walz presidential campaigns in 2024 and was executive director of the party for a few years starting in 2021. 
Remiker is responsible for some of the communications campaigns that the party launched during competitive elections, including the “People v. Musk” campaign, which highlighted Elon Musk’s involvement in trying to win the state Supreme Court seat for Schimel and his work to slash funds and staffing of federal agencies.
Remiker said he thinks the state party and candidates are in a “fantastic” spot, but that “there’s always room to improve” and “to figure out how we take things to the next level” and that’s what he’d work on as chair. 
Despite committing to remaining neutral in a state party chair race during his DNC chair campaign, Wikler reversed course and endorsed Remiker in a column in late May. He said at a WisPolitics event that he changed his mind because he wanted people to know about the work that Remiker’s done for the party and is making calls on his behalf. Wikler said that he thinks there will be a “burgeoning blue wave” in 2026.
“My decision to endorse was I knew that I thought he’d do a phenomenal job and I also knew that I thought he’d been working behind the scenes and people would not know what a role he played in so many of our fights unless I said something,” Wikler said.
Remiker is also endorsed by U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, State Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine), State Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and former state party chairs. 
Remiker said that other than his father being in a union, he didn’t grow up in a very political family, but he caught the politics bug “pretty quickly” in college at UW-La Crosse and during an internship with the special election campaign for now-state Rep. Steve Doyle (D-Onalaska).
“I collected nomination signatures. I knocked on doors, and I just love talking with people,” Remiker said. The loss of his dad’s job when a nuclear facility in Kewaunee was decommissioned also pushed him towards politics. 
“It was a knife in the heart [to] this sort of rural county and area,” Remiker said. “This facility provided a lot of good paying benefits, providing union jobs, and then, to add insult to injury, I find out afterwards that they essentially are offering people their jobs back… as independent contractors with no benefits, a fraction of the pay that they were receiving before… I was mad as heck.”
Remiker said it was at that point that he decided to see where a career in politics would lead and it has shaped his mission for the party: ensuring it fights for working people.
“Our biggest failure from 2024 is that people lost faith in us as the party that fights for the working class, and I really want to center that in my work,” Remiker said.
Remiker noted there is “tremendous” opportunity for Democrats with fair state legislative maps and backlash against the Trump administration that is motivating people to become involved with the party, but the challenge will be keeping people engaged through 2026. He said there is more the party can do to ensure its engaging authentically across the state in all communities and to help Democrats in rural communities feel like they don’t have to hide. 
“We just have to make sure that when there is energy, we are running towards it and bringing it with us, so that we can point it like a laser at the fights that we need to win next year,” Remiker said. “We have a lot of fights on our hands.”
Remiker said he wants 72 county strategies that are unique to each county party. He said he’d work towards that by building on the neighborhood teams that exist by creating regional teams, which would be tasked with going county by county to better understand the needs of county parties, college Democrats, community groups and others. 
“There’s no one size fits all solution to how we sort of support each county, but we really have to get into the weeds…,” Remiker said. “This county they need some help building their membership base, because they might be struggling to have enough folks to sustain their level of work. This county might need some additional help opening a year round permanent office in their county. This county might need funding to get a trailer that they can build a parade float on. I think there’s more room to provide resources. I just think that we need to make sure that we are listening, engaging and have a more consistent feedback loop with our leadership on the ground.” 
Fundraising, he said, would also play a critical role for making that work. With his previous work for the party, Remiker noted that he has already helped do that work and would continue it as chair. 
“Wisconsin’s unique success [in fundraising] comes down to relationships of trust built with donors large and small over time, and that requires being honest about losses and proud of your victories,” Remiker said. “I’ve been lucky enough having worked with Ben so closely to have been part of sort of building that trust over time — helping to write the memos, do the calls. I’ve raised millions of dollars for the party myself.” 
Democratic comms professional says he offers fresh POV 
Zepecki, a 43-year-old from Milwaukee, is pitching himself as having the fresh perspective the party needs to win more elections, saying he’ll work to revamp the organization’s communications. 
“Two things can be true at the same time… Ben and his team have done a remarkable job. We are the envy of 49 other state parties. At the same time, it is true that Democrats have a lot of work to do,” Zepecki said in an interview. “Our brand is busted. Our messaging isn’t landing. We have work to do, and you shouldn’t need more evidence of that than the occupant of the White House, than the fact that Ron Johnson is still representing Wisconsin in the U.S. Senate.” 
As he decided to run, Zepecki said he took the time to consult a broad swath of people and entered with supporters who he said “speak to the broad coalition that is our party — rural, urban, suburban, north, south, east, west, gay, straight, progressive [and] moderate.” He said it was clear there was an “appetite” for some changes to the party.
Zepecki is endorsed by several state lawmakers, including Reps. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), Clinton Anderson (D-Beloit), Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee), Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) and Sen. Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay). He also has support from former Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Linda Honold and several local party chairs including Kelly Gallaher of the Racine County party, Nancy Fisker of the Lafayette County party and Matthew Mareno of the Waukesha County party. 
Some advocates have also given their support including Angela Lang, the executive director of Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC), Shawn Phetteplace, an organizer and campaign strategist with small business advocacy organization Main Street Alliance and Kristin Lyerly, a Green Bay OB-GYN who advocates for reproductive rights and ran for Congress in 2024.
Zepecki appeared critical of Wikler for his endorsement of Remiker in a video posted to Facebook in May, saying the current chair had assured him he wouldn’t make an endorsement and that he “abandoned” that commitment. He declined to speak further on the issue in the Examiner interview. 
“I thought that was vitally important because it is the members of our party — the folks who knock the doors and plant the signs and make the phone calls — who should decide this election and know that their voice is paramount in this process,” Zepecki said in the video.
“If you don’t change the people who are at the top are, I don’t believe we’re going to see the changes and improvements we need to see,” Zepcki added. “We need new leadership and a fresh perspective. That’s what I’m offering.”
Since 2016, Zepecki has run a communications company and worked for organizations such as Protect Our Care Wisconsin. Prior to that, he also worked on federal and state campaigns including Democrat Mary Burke’s 2014 run for governor, a U.S. Senate campaign in Nebraska and a presidential primary campaign in Nevada. 
Zepecki said he wants to build better infrastructure for the party’s communications and has been saying there are “five Ms” that should guide the work: message, messenger, mood, medium and masses.
“Spoiler alert: there is no magic set of words in just the right order that unlocks your vote… You’re better off having a young person communicate with a young person, better off having someone who’s a union member communicate with a union member. We need more messengers…,” Zepecki said. “We can’t just assume that our elected officials are going to be the only ones communicating our values, and when those messengers are out there, I think they need to match the mood of the country… It is virtually impossible to get ahead, and people are pissed about that. When we do not match the mood of the electorate, people tune us out. There are more ways to reach people than ever before, and we need to be more intentional about using more of that.” 
Zepecki said this approach will help the party, which he said has troubles communicating what it’s for and against. When it comes to what Democrats are for, Zepecki said that communicating the party as one of “economic opportunity and fairness” is essential. 
“Whether they’re building trades union members and apprentices, whether it’s public sector workers, the Democratic Party is the party of working people. When we get back to communicating that every single day, I think people are going to respond favorably,” Zepecki said, adding that this “doesn’t mean that we don’t stand up for our trans brothers and sisters. It does not mean that we do not protect civil rights.”
Zepecki said with the “big, pivotal year” of 2026 upcoming, he would want to use the latter half of the year to build up the party’s power and infrastructure to be prepared to win. He said the approach would vary region to region but it comes down to communicating that people are welcome in the party and it will work for them. 
“It is required that we ask for and earn the support of people who have voted Republican in the past, and we do so without making them swear out a blood oath to be Democrats for the rest of their life. That is the way you win elections in a 50-50 state like Wisconsin,” Zepecki said. “We share many of the frustrations that people who vote for Donald Trump and Republicans have when it comes to how our economy is working. We do a better job communicating that we welcome folks into our party, don’t like the chaos, division and the overreach of what the Trump administration is doing, and we’re going to be just fine next year.” 
Zepecki said his time serving as a political appointee in the federal Small Business Administration (SBA) in the Obama administration is the role that has prepared him the most for serving as chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. He said he was tasked with leading a team of civil servants across 68 districts, and he compared it to Wisconsin’s 72 counties.
“There are different realities and challenges and context depending on where you are…You have to earn trust. You have to win trust, and you have to lead and communicate internally as well as you communicate externally,” Zepecki said. “When you do that, I think you can improve organizations. We certainly did that at SBA — incredibly, incredibly proud of the two and a half years I spent there — and that’s the type of approach that I would bring to this.”
Garcia wants to strengthen county parties 
The basis of Garcia’s campaign is strengthening the state’s county parties. He told the Examiner that he has seen first-hand the “dangerous disconnect between the state party and county parties” that exists. 
Garcia, who is originally from San Antonio, Texas, said he grew up “very, very political,” having helped Democrats since he was a teenager. He and his wife moved to La Crosse about seven years ago after she secured a job at the UW branch campus and when they arrived he said he almost immediately looked to get involved at the local level. He is also an educator currently working as an instructor at Western Technical College and having worked in K-12 education for 17 years prior.
“‘Hey, I live here now. How can I help?’” Garcia said, he asked when he walked in the La Crosse County party office. “I started working from there.” Over the last several years, Garcia said the party has grown strong and robust.
“We get a lot of work done,” Garcia said, noting that La Crosse recently elected its most progressive mayor and city council ever, and just overturned the 96th state Assembly seat, which had been represented by Republicans for about 70 years. 
“We were able to flip that through hard work,” Garcia said, adding that new fairer maps helped also. “That was because of the strong infrastructure that we built at the county,” Garcia said. “What I want to do is replicate that all across the state.”
Garcia has support from Democrats in his local area, including Rep. Tara Johnson (D-Town of Shelby) of the 96th district, Rep. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse), La Crosse Mayor Shaundel Washington-Spivey, as well as the chair of the Jackson and Richland County parties and John Stanley, who serves as the progressive caucus chair.
Garcia said some of the changes the party needs to make may appear small but are important for helping the party reach as many people as possible. 
“Logistical things like packets with turf maps that make sense…,” Garcia said. “If you actually live in the area, you know, there are problems with how it’s put together, and it slows down our door knockers. Things like we’re not doing enough talking to our rural voters, and we’re not doing enough to talk to our farmers.”
As chair, Garcia said he would want to ensure that county parties have the resources, tools, training and infrastructure so that they can spend all their time reaching out to voters. He said that he also wants to ensure that county parties have a bigger seat at the table when it comes to organizing and messaging decision making. 
“County parties are the experts in what is happening in their own communities, and we need to be listening to them in ways that we’re not right now about the best way to really reach out and talk to voters in those areas,” Garcia said. “The organizing strategy that works in Madison is not the organizing strategy that works best in Pierce County, and the messaging that works wonderfully in Milwaukee is not necessarily the strategy that’s going to work best in Menominee.” 
Garcia added that this would apply to other local organizing organizations, including the state party caucuses such as the Latino, Black and rural caucuses. 
Garcia said strengthening the county parties is essential towards winning the trifecta in 2026.
“It’s the county parties that are really the hub of activity for electing our Assembly candidates and our state Senate candidates. It is the county parties where we find our door knocking volunteers. It’s the county party where we find the infrastructure the candidates need to tap into in order to mount an effective campaign, and so the stronger we can make these county parties, the more likely we are to flip those Assembly and Senate seats that we need to flip.” 
Garcia said it is also important to get to the areas where it’s difficult to win as well.  
“Even if an Assembly seat goes 65% for Republicans and is a very difficult win for a Democrat, we still desperately need those votes for our statewide office holders.”
Garcia said that people don’t get elected by being against something so Democrats needs to be proactive, illustrating what they are doing for people, their vision for government and, specifically, honing in on a message of “protecting Wisconsin families.”
“That’s what Democrats are trying to do from child care, where we’re trying to make it actually affordable to pay for child care, trying to expand Medicaid so that pregnant women have the care that they need to take care of their babies, all the way up to protecting Medicare and Social Security,” Garcia said. “It is Democrats that are consistently passing laws — or preventing Republicans from passing laws — to help our people.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — Former State Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks announced her 2026 candidacy Friday to return to the Nebraska Legislature, a day after the current officeholder said she would not seek reelection.
State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln announced her decision not to run again Thursday, leaving the central Lincoln seat open, as first reported by the Nebraska Examiner. 
Just 24 hours later, Pansing Brooks “enthusiastically” threw her hat in the ring with Raybould’s support, one of more than 70 current and former officials to endorse Pansing Brooks.
“People keep calling me saying, ‘What should I do?’” Pansing Brooks told the Examiner. “And I keep thinking, ‘Well, what should I do to help this country right now?’ The main thing that I know that I can do is run for office.”
Pansing Brooks, 66, said she hopes to be an example for others to run for office and get involved in these “very strident times.”
‘There’s still work to do’
During her first two terms in office, 2015 to 2023, Pansing Brooks said she worked to be a voice to bring people together, elevate conversations and help people see other sides to issues.

If elected back to Legislative District 28, Pansing Brooks said she would continue uplifting juvenile justice reform, combatting human trafficking, defending workers’ rights, protecting public education, supporting small businesses, expanding correctional programming for successful reentry and ensuring access to and equity in health care, “right where I left off in 2022.”
Among Pansing Brooks’ previous successes: protecting survivors of human trafficking from prostitution charges, mandating new juvenile room confinement standards and reports and shielding survivors of sexual assault and sex trafficking before criminal charges are filed.
“There’s still work to do,” she said.
Pansing Brooks has a history of working with conservative colleagues, such as with former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan on dyslexia. The pair toured schools and passed laws to increase interventions for students with dyslexia and require teachers to be educated about the disability.
Pansing Brooks also worked closely with former State Sen. Tom Brewer, a member of the Oglala Lakota Tribe and the Legislature’s first Native member, notably to help pressure the closing of four beer stores in the village of Whiteclay in Brewer’s north-central Nebraska district. For decades, the stores helped fuel alcoholism for the neighboring Pine Ridge Reservation, home to the Oglala Lakota.
The duo also worked to add “Indigenous Peoples’ Day” to state law alongside Columbus Day. 
Brewer is one of many former conservative colleagues of Pansing Brooks to have already endorsed her 2026 campaign.
Returning after term limits
Pansing Brooks, if elected, would join a handful of lawmakers to return after being term-limited. She said she knows there will be “horrible days,” as there were before and that it might be tough.
However, Pansing Brooks said, “There’s goodness and kindness to share, important laws to make and ways to support our fabulous Nebraskans.”

Since 2023, the one-house Legislature has been increasingly divided on partisan lines. Pansing Brooks would return as lawmakers have a heightened focus on the LGBTQ community that she advocated for during her time in office. 
She had proposed legislation attempting to outlaw discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation, which other senators picked up after her absence.
“I care about the rights of people to live and to be who they are, to not have prejudice against them, no matter what group they’re in,” Pansing Brooks said. “But I’m also going to be there to learn and listen and try to figure out if there’s new steps where I’m needed or new issues where I’m needed, then that’s what I’ll do.”
A different Legislature?
Another lawmaker who returned after being term-limited, former State Sen. Steve Lathrop of Omaha, declined to seek reelection in 2022, in part because of how much the institution had changed in the four years he was gone. Lathrop endorsed Pansing Brooks, with whom he served.
Just one lawmaker has been term-limited twice since the voter-approved restrictions took full effect after 2006: former State Sen. Ernie Chambers of Omaha.
Pansing Brooks said that, if elected, she would not return with any assumptions that she would be treated differently than other “newbie” lawmakers.
She said she knows she would need to make new friendships and gain trust, which she’s ready to do, and that Nebraska could be a model for Congress on working together.
In 2022, Pansing Brooks was the Democratic candidate for Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, falling short to U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb. Flood, a former colleague, repeatedly sought to tie Pansing Brooks to national Democratic policies and party leaders.

Pansing Brooks in that 2022 congressional race won her legislative district by a slightly greater percentage of votes than Raybould did that year. It is Lincoln’s most progressive legislative district.
A bipartisan group of former senators endorsed Pansing Brooks, including State Sens. Kathy Campbell, Bob Krist, John McCollister, DiAnna Schimek, John Stinner, Tony Vargas and Lynne Walz.
She is endorsed by current State Sens. Machaela Cavanaugh, John Cavanaugh, Danielle Conrad, Wendy DeBoer, George Dungan, John Fredrickson, Dunixi Guereca, Megan Hunt, Margo Juarez, Terrell McKinney, Dan Quick, Raybould, Victor Rountree and Ashlei Spivey. All but Hunt, a nonpartisan progressive, are Democrats in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.
Other early endorsements include Bob Kerrey and Ben Nelson (former governors and former U.S. senators), former Nebraska Lt. Govs. Kim Robak and Maxine Moul and Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird.
A plea to work together
Pansing Brooks, who had been a Republican for much of her life until the 2000s, including a stint as Lancaster County GOP chair, said she’s honored by conservative friends she made in the Legislature who have now endorsed her.
“It makes me realize that this is possible. We don’t all have to be divided and in circular firing squads, just firing away at each other,” Pansing Brooks said.
Pansing Brooks added that the Legislature is special and that she hopes lawmakers can continue to find common ground.
“We’ve done that in the past,” Pansing Brooks said. “We can continue to do it.”

The September encounter and subsequent court case highlight questions about police accountability.
The post A Lander cop was ‘out of line’ during a traffic stop. The driver was the one who got in trouble. appeared first on WyoFile .","In September, Lander police arrested local resident Kayvon Powell for interfering with an officer following a traffic stop on his way home from work.
After being pulled over on an allegation of reckless driving, Powell quickly found himself in a shouting match with Sgt. Ron Wells.
Wells wanted to see a driver’s license, something Powell didn’t have, and wanted Powell to roll down his car window, which he said was broken. Powell, a 33-year-old Black man with dreadlocks, tattoos and gold veneers, felt Wells was acting aggressively after the officer opened his car door without permission. Powell loudly and repeatedly requested a supervising officer come to observe the interaction. 
“The only thing that I was worried about was my safety,” Powell later said in court. “I want your superior here so I can make it home.” 
By the end of the encounter, Wells and another officer would mace and jail Powell, pulling some of his long dreadlocks out of his head during the rough arrest. 
Powell took his interference charge to trial, but a jury found him guilty. The jury did not find, however, that he had resisted the arrest, even as he was pulled from his car and roughly handcuffed against its trunk.
The Lander police chief and the judge who presided over Powell’s criminal trial both said they believe Wells was overly aggressive. 
“Sgt. Wells was out of line, absolutely 100% out of line,” Fremont County Circuit Court Judge Jefferson Coombs said at Powell’s April sentencing, describing the officer as going “off the rails.”
Wells also questioned his own actions after the encounter, said Chief Kelly Waugh, who was a captain at the time. The day of the arrest, Wells told Waugh he felt he had “lost his cool,” the now-chief told WyoFile in a phone interview. 
“[Wells] takes full ownership that he did not handle himself appropriately that day,” Waugh said. The chief declined to discuss personnel issues and whether Wells faced disciplinary proceedings, but said he was impressed by the sergeant’s willingness to take responsibility for his actions and believed that self accountability would be a powerful motivator for change.
Wells did not respond to emails from WyoFile seeking comment.

Powell was put on probation with a suspended 45-day jail sentence hanging over his head. He also still carries the raw emotions generated by the arrest and his subsequent treatment at the jail — where Fremont County sheriff deputies roughly forced his head down onto a counter after accusing him of looking at them in a way they didn’t like, body camera video shows. 
Powell’s treatment in jail was not part of his criminal trial, but could play into a civil case, if he pursues one. 
The public defender’s office is appealing his conviction, court records indicate. 
Eight months after the encounter, Powell has a conviction on his record for his role in the encounter. Wells’ actions received criticism from a judge and his boss, but it’s unclear if he faced repercussions beyond that. The episode raises questions about accountability — for police and for residents charged with crimes — in Wyoming communities.
The fact that Wells had expressed regret over how the arrest was handled was little consolation to Powell.
“He never ‘took ownership of it’ in court or in his police report,” Powell said, “where it really mattered, where my life was concerned.” 
Accountability questions
Days after the April sentencing, Powell saw the police chief at a downtown gas station. Powell approached Waugh, and surreptitiously recorded the conversation on his cell phone.
The chief, while noting that Wells was acting within the scope of his duties, conceded to Powell that “what he [Wells] did was very unprofessional.” Powell then told the chief he intended to sue the department, prompting Waugh to end the conversation. At that point, Waugh later told WyoFile, the matter needed to be handled by attorneys. 
If Powell does pursue legal action against the department, it will be a relatively rare case for Wyoming. Last year, only two claims were filed against Equality State officers on constitutional grounds, such as the violation of civil rights Powell is alleging, according to a report from the state insurance pool responsible for covering Wyoming law enforcement officers. In 2023, there were eight such claims, and the highest number of constitutional claims made against officers in recent years came in 2020, with 13.  
Nationally, fewer than 1% of people who think police officers violated their rights ever file a lawsuit, according to academic researchers. People who do sue the police face a high bar for legal victory, as federal court precedent gives officers wide latitude for actions undertaken on duty. Even cases that survive motions to dismiss are successful only around 15% of the time, according to the Harvard Law Review, and as to those, juries tend to award lower financial judgments than they do in other civil cases. 
In Powell’s telling, his story also raises questions about whether his appearance has made his life more difficult in Lander. Powell himself is a complicated figure — while determined to stand up for his rights both on the street and in court, he also, according to the judge, was dishonest on the witness stand after choosing to testify in his own trial.

Powell moved to Lander from Charlottesville, Virginia, he said, after that city hosted the Unite the Right rally in 2017. The overt racism and violence that consumed the southern city, and the fact that local officials didn’t do more to stop it, horrified him, he said. 
People told him Lander was a quiet town, he said.
“I guess if you can blend in a little better than me, it might be,” Powell told WyoFile in an interview at his home.
Waugh rejected the suggestion that Powell’s appearance influenced his treatment by police. As a law enforcement agency on the edge of the Wind River Indian Reservation, his department polices one of the more diverse communities in Wyoming, he said, and has taken pains to build community relationships, including with people of color. 
“Racism is so far from the Lander Police Department’s actions,” he said. 
On the witness stand, Powell admitted to being repeatedly cited for driving without a license. He believed the police were always out to pull him over, but he told the jury that officers often “weren’t smart enough” to catch him. He’d had prior interactions with Wells that left a bad impression, he said.
Likewise, the department had run-ins with Powell before the September arrest, Waugh said.
“Oh, you know it all, I remember,” Wells said to Powell at one point during their shouting match. 
The arrest
Powell’s Sept. 3 arrest arose from an incident months earlier, in July 2024. On that day, Powell was walking to a gas station when he was punched by another Lander man he had a dispute with, Mario Cabanas. Cabanas was convicted on an assault charge, and a judge ordered him to pay thousands of dollars for Powell’s medical bills.
But that didn’t seem to settle the issue for Powell, according to Cabanas, who the prosecution called as a late witness in Powell’s interference trial. Cabanas said Powell saw him driving on Sept. 3 and began to pursue him. Powell denied that allegation during his testimony and said he did not recognize Cabanas. Later in the day, the prosecution showed the court cell phone video Cabanas took that, according to his testimony, captured Powell closely tailgating him. 
Though Powell was cited for reckless driving, the prosecution dropped that charge after he said he wanted to take it to trial as well, according to Powell’s testimony. 
On Sept. 3, Cabanas called the police and told them Powell had seen him downtown and started tailgating him. Wells, followed by another officer, responded and pulled over Powell. 
WyoFile did not attend the trial but obtained an audio recording of the proceedings from the Fremont County Circuit Court. WyoFile also reviewed Wells’ body camera footage, which was provided by Powell, as well as footage from his own cell phone. Audio of other portions of the footage was played for the jury.

This video has been trimmed slightly for brevity and to remove portions in which other jail inmates are visible. -Ed.
In that audio, Wells raises his voice after approaching Powell’s car and asking him to roll down the window, which he doesn’t. The window, Powell testified later, was broken. The beater car — a 1993 Crown Victoria — was what Powell said he could afford to get to and from the job he needed to help raise two children.  
Wells opens the door and angrily begins telling Powell he was “trying to run people off the road.” Powell begins yelling back, asking what evidence he had. Wells then tells him to open his door, and Powell says he does not have to. Wells opens the door himself and asks for his driver’s license and proof of insurance. 
Powell continues yelling, demanding “a superior” and later “a white shirt” — the uniform he says law enforcement supervisors wore in Charlottesville. Wells eventually does call his then-captain, Waugh, who was off-duty. “He wants my superior down here,” Wells said into his phone, his tone sarcastic. He later laughs about the request. 
On the call, Wells also checked with Waugh whether he could arrest Powell for interference, since Powell wouldn’t comply with the officer’s request for his driver’s license. “He is absolutely not complying,” Wells said.
Powell, however, showed the second responding officer a casino identification issued by the Eastern Shoshone Gaming Agency. That officer, Powell said in court, had approached him in a calmer and more respectful manner. 
Waugh told WyoFile there is no requirement that a supervising officer report to a crime scene if a suspect asks for one. Ideally, a supervisor would respond in such a situation to monitor the incident, Waugh said, but on that day, Wells was the highest-ranking officer on duty. 
Wells told Powell he was under arrest, and in the video, Powell can be heard saying he’s getting out of the car before the two officers take hold of him. He’s then put up against the car and handcuffed. Dash camera video from Wells’ car shows the officers shoving Powell into the trunk of the Crown Victoria twice before putting him into the back of the police vehicle. 
Though it wasn’t captured on any video WyoFile obtained, the second officer pepper sprayed Powell while he was in the back of the police car. According to Wells’ arrest affidavit, the other officer used the spray because Powell used his feet to block the door from closing. Powell denied that. Audio from the ride to the jail indicates Powell in considerable discomfort from the pepper spray in his eye. 
Another section of body camera video, from within the jail, shows that deputies there push Powell’s head into a counter and grab him by the neck after concluding he was staring down Wells while handcuffed. “You’re not going to eye fuck us in here,” one deputy told him, according to video. “That’s not a crime,” Powell responded. 
The Fremont County Sheriff’s Office has not received any complaint about Powell’s treatment in the jail, Undersheriff Mike Hutchison told WyoFile on Monday. WyoFile provided Hutchison a copy of body camera footage, which he reviewed.
Powell “disregarded reasonable requests” both during his arrest and inside the jail, Hutchison told WyoFile in an email. “The Deputies responded when he displayed a combative and aggressive demeanor while in detention. Although some coarse language was used, the Deputies’ reaction was within the bounds of our policy.”
A screenshot from body camera footage shows a deputy grabbing Kayvon Powell in the Fremont County jail. Fremont County’s undersheriff told WyoFile his deputies acted within policy during Powell’s detention. (Screenshot of Lander Police Department body camera footage)
Powell does not believe he ever physically resisted arrest, he said. He stood up to an aggressive officer, he said, and was punished for it. “If someone telling you they don’t like what you’re doing is going to set you off to the point that you’re going to beat, mace and pull someone’s hair out, then that’s not the job for you,” he said. 
Wells’ actions during the arrest were out of character for the veteran officer, who has served in Lander for 24 years, Waugh said. “We’re all human beings,” Waugh said, “some days get to us too.”
As a supervisor, Waugh said, “I usually spend more time trying to get [officers] to understand what they did and own their actions.”  
The sentencing  
Powell’s sentencing came two days after the jury convicted him. Judge Coombs listened to testimony from the prosecutor, who described Powell as a scofflaw. Then he heard from the public defender, who said her client had learned his lesson and now had a license. Finally, Powell addressed the court, describing himself as beaten by police for trying to advocate for his safety.
Then the judge said his piece. “There’s different theories out there as far as how judges should explain themselves,” he began. “I’ve heard some judges say, ‘if I never say it, I can never get in trouble for it.’”
Describing the case as “unique,” Coombs then paused for 20 seconds. “Well, I’m just going to go ahead and say this. I think that Sgt. Wells was out of line, absolutely 100% out of line. Was he outside the legal performance of his duties? Jury said he wasn’t and that’s fine. I accept that.”
But the officer was outside the bounds of department policy, the judge said. “As soon as Mr. Powell didn’t open his door, Sgt. Wells sort of went off the rails,” Coombs said. 
On the other hand, Powell did not “one time” give Wells a meaningful response to his questions, Coombs said. He sentenced Powell to a suspended jail sentence. 
Ultimately, the jury found Powell guilty of interference, and “therefore Sgt. Wells was in the lawful performance of his duties,” Coombs said. “Even though he was certainly not the poster child for how a police officer should act during a traffic stop.”

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)At a state prison in Stanley, Wisconsin, participants in a Native American-focused group take part in traditional cultural practices.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
According to Ryan Greendeer, executive government relations officer with the Ho-Chunk Nation, Stanley Correctional Institution’s chaplain recently reached out to the tribe with requests for the group’s programming.  
The chaplain wanted teaching materials, as many materials in the current selection were old. He said that men learn songs and Native language with the materials, as well as history and culture.
The chaplain said the men are eager to learn more about all things Native, according to Greendeer. He was also seeking a larger pipe bowl and poles to help build a new lodge. The pipe has a history of ceremonial use.  
The prison’s annual report for fiscal year 2024 mentions a Native American smudge and drum group. The report says that each month, several religious organizations and volunteers come in to hold various services, and the list includes “Sweat Lodge (Native American).”
There were 79 American Indian or Alaska Native people at Stanley Correctional as of April 30, according to the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC). 
Gov. Tony Evers’ budget recommendations for corrections included a tribal liaison position for the DOC. The liaison would be responsible for working with Native American tribes and bands on the agency’s behalf.
Each of the governor’s cabinet agencies has already set at least one staff member to be a tribal liaison. The governor’s proposal would create a new position, set aside for the job of tribal liaison for corrections. 
Evers also proposed creating a director of Native American affairs in the Department of Administration and tribal liaisons in several other agencies, including the Department of Justice and Department of Natural Resources. 
“Gov. Evers’ commitment has been—and always will be—to ensure that the state maintains strong partnerships with the Tribal Nations by recognizing and respecting the needs and perspectives of the Nations and Indigenous people,” Britt Cudaback, communications director for the governor’s office, said in an email.
The Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee removed the proposed positions in May, along with hundreds of other items proposed by Evers. 
“Unfortunately, [Evers] sends us an executive budget that’s just piles full of stuff that doesn’t make sense and spends recklessly and raises taxes and has way too much policy,” Joint Finance Committee co-chair Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said in May.
Tribes already work with the state, including the Oneida Nation, which is located in northeast Wisconsin. The tribe told the Examiner that it continues to work with the state to make sure incarcerated Native Americans have proper access to culturally based practices and resources. 
With a tribal liaison that can help navigate the corrections system, the tribe’s efforts to make sure resources are provided and distributed appropriately make better progress, the tribe said. 
“These efforts will continue whether or not a tribal liaison position exists, although the impact on incarcerated individuals who use culturally based resources may be greater as efforts take longer,” the tribe said. 
The Oneida Nation said it “supports tribes’ efforts to ensure incarcerated members maintain access to appropriate support services as provided by tribal, state, and federal laws.”
Maggie Olson, communications coordinator for the St. Croix  Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, said the tribe is not located close to the corrections facilities where their tribal members are incarcerated. This is a significant barrier, she said. 
“It would be nice to be able to have a better handle on where our people are within the system to ensure they are having their spiritual and cultural needs met,” Olson said in an email to the Examiner. “It is much easier (at this time) to meet religious needs (think Christianity) within the correctional system than it is to meet the spiritual and cultural needs of Native Americans within the system.”
A great first step would be having a dedicated person who can build relationships with incarcerated Native Americans, she said.
In a statement, the tribe said the liaison “would be a start to developing and enhancing tribal input with State initiatives.” The tribe said it wants to work with the DOC on access to supportive services in county jails. 
Olson said she met DOC Secretary Jared Hoy at an event on June 5 and that they had a great discussion about the potential benefits of a tribal liaison at the agency.
“With the uncertainties surrounding federal funding, we are hopeful state funding will be increased to tribal programs in Wisconsin,” Olson said.
The tribe’s criminal justice work involves partnership with the DOC. In the St. Croix Tribal Reintegration Program, case managers work with tribal members before and after their release from prison or jail, the tribe said. The program has a memo of understanding with the Department of Corrections, providing guidance for working relationships between tribal reentry and probation.
All of the governor’s cabinet agencies have consultation policies that say how they will work with tribal governments. Agencies and tribal elected officials have annual consultation meetings to talk about programs, laws and funding that may affect the tribe. 
Discussions at the annual state-tribal consultation tend to be about high-level policy, but they can delve into specifics, Greendeer said. He gave an example related to tribal members who are on probation or parole. 
“For example, a topic that keeps coming up is re-entry programming for enrolled tribal member offenders,” Greendeer said. “A concern discussed at a recent consultation was that probation/parole officers might not consider tribal norms/values, citing a lack of eye contact in saying a client is disengaged or disconnected.”
The co-chairs and vice-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee did not respond to requests for comment. DOC communications director Beth Hardtke did not answer a question from the Examiner about the responsibilities and goals of the tribal liaison position.

(Getty Images)Home insurance premiums in Indiana are on the rise — and nonpayment is forcing more policy cancellations, according to a report released this week by the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana. Insurers have also chosen not to renew policies.
“Home insurance is vital to keeping homes in safe condition and preserving the wealth that homeowners hold in their properties,” the center said in a Wednesday news release. “In recent years, higher insurance premiums have strained the budgets of existing homeowners and are pushing homeownership further out of reach.”
The organization also critiqued the limited data available and called for greater transparency.
The average home insurance premium for a typical Indiana homeowner increased by 16%, or $412, from 2021 to 2024, according to the report. 
The Indianapolis metropolitan area saw a similar but slightly higher increase of 16.5%, or $440, over that period of time. The report cited an April study by the Consumer Federation of America.
“The premium estimates used by CFA are taken from ‘test quotes’ for a typical home with a replacement value of $350,000 and a homeowner with mid-tier credit, as well as dozens of other controlled factors,” the report observed. “Insurance premiums vary widely based on these factors … By holding these factors constant, CFA estimates are able to show a clear increase over time.”
It said CFA’s estimates are likely still conservative because they don’t account for increases in property value, noting that “a home with a $350,000 replacement value in 2021 would likely cost much more to replace in 2024, which would increase the insurance premium as well.”
Despite that, CFA’s estimated average Indiana home insurance premium of $2,567 in 2021 was higher than others.
The two most common insurance policies are HO-3 and HO-5, with the latter being more extensive.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners calculated an average policy cost of $1,058.

Data from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Federal Insurance Office revealed a $1,464 estimate for HO-3 and HO-5 policies, according to the report. But because Indiana was one of just seven states that declined to give FIO insurance policy data, the dataset only accounts for insurance policies in Indiana from national insurance providers.
Some homeowners have found themselves without coverage.
One in every 54 policies, or 1.8%, were canceled due to nonpayment in 2022, according to the center’s analysis of FIO data. The rate was at least twice as high in four counties: Fayette, Blackford, Vermillion and Sullivan counties.
One ZIP code within Jennings County recorded a whopping 16.7% rate — with one in six policies being cancelled for nonpayment.
Another 1.2% of policies statewide, or one in 85, weren’t renewed by the insurer in 2022 for other reasons, per the analysis. Six counties had rates of 2% or higher, peaking with Pulaski County’s 6% rate. That means one in every 17 policies wasn’t renewed.
“A nonrenewal typically means the insurer saw the home and/or the homeowner as having become too risky to continue to cover,” the report explained.
That can occur as homes age and require expensive repairs or replacements of key features, the risk of natural disasters increase, or — as the center noted — the use of aerial photography for risk assessments in lieu of in-person visits.

Once a buzzing sight of commerce, the route in southeast Wyoming is now a respite for bikers, hikers and other non-motorized rovers. 
The post Medicine Bow Rail Trail: 21-mile stretch of solitude appeared first on WyoFile .","When immigrant laborers built it in the early 1900s, the Hahn’s Peak and Pacific Railway had bragging rights as the highest standard gauge railroad in the country at around 9,000 feet. 
Its railcars first hauled gold, then livestock, timber and coal, and soon mail and passengers between Colorado and Wyoming. The Monday, Wednesday and Friday trains ran south, while the Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday trains went north. 
The corridor is much quieter today, with few signs to suggest its previous life as a buzzing sight of commerce. Now, bikers, runners, horseback riders and other non-motorized rovers will find a 21-mile stretch of solitude known as the Medicine Bow Rail Trail. 
The route snakes through large stands of aspen, fir, lodgepole and spruce, and passes by sagebrush meadows, ponds and swamps. Lake Owen marks one of its six trailheads, and there are several fire scars along the way, where blue skies silhouette burned trees.

Trail running, especially in a place as sacred and dangerous as the Grand Teton, relies on a shared understanding of fairness and a consideration of others' safety, writes Ryan Burke.
The post Ethical mountaineers take responsibility, not shortcuts appeared first on WyoFile .","I’ve often felt deep disappointment when a day in the mountains ends just shy of a goal. In those moments, all the time and energy invested can feel wasted. That’s why I can empathize with the pressure Michelino Sunseri must have felt during his speed record attempt on the Grand Teton — faced with a pivotal decision: follow the official trail for an extra half mile or take a closed shortcut that would save precious time on his descent. With the weight of public expectations bearing down and the clock ticking, the temptation must have been overwhelming. I can only imagine the moment of panic when I suspect he realized he couldn’t beat the existing record without breaking the rules. It’s a mistake any of us could have made — choosing the easy path over the right one. But in that moment, the honorable thing would have been to shrug and say, “Today wasn’t the day,” and try again. That decision would have honored Andy Anderson’s previous on-trail record, respected National Park Service regulations and upheld the values of the trail-running community.

Opinion

Unfortunately, that’s not what happened. What followed Sunseri’s failed attempt was not accountability, but a sustained campaign of deflection, half-truths and selective storytelling. Nine months later, rather than owning up to the mistake, he’s doubled down on defending his actions. It strains his credibility to claim ignorance, especially after commenting on his Strava account that he’d done the route over 40 times, meaning he knew the trail well and had seen the “Closed for Regrowth” over and over again. Why stick to the legal route on the way up, only to veer off on the shortcut on the way down? 
Comparing his Strava route from the record attempt to his previous, legal ascents reveals even more troubling facts: Not only did he take the closed shortcut, but he also cut 11 additional switchbacks further up the mountain, trimming 1.2 miles off the standard route — a reduction of nearly 8% in total mileage. That’s not a minor shortcut; that’s a different course entirely. 
Imagine someone winning a gold medal for running 92 meters in a 100-meter dash. Even if we generously calculate his best pace and apply it to the missed segments — which included uphill sections — he still would have finished several minutes behind the previous record. The claim of a new fastest time is not just misleading, it’s fundamentally dishonest.
This matters because trail running, especially in a place as sacred and dangerous as the Grand Teton, relies on a shared understanding of fairness. If breaking established norms is tolerated, future athletes will feel pressured to follow suit just to remain competitive — even if it means risking fines or others’ safety. Sunseri’s choice to bypass the legal trail through a loose, dangerous gully above trail crew workers who reported rock fall in their direction didn’t just threaten his integrity — it endangered others. The mountain code of ethics demands that other people are taken into consideration when making any decision, which stands in stark contrast to “making questionable choices and being absolutely reckless,” which is how Sunseri describes his speed record descent. In this situation, Sunseri chose personal gain above all else.
What’s also troubling is Sunseri’s response to criticism. Rather than accepting responsibility, he mocked guides as “crusty,” vilified the National Park Service and told critics on social media to “fight me.” 
This isn’t just immature — it’s destructive and doesn’t take into consideration the delicate relationship between runners, guides and the park service. As a prominent figure with a significant following, Sunseri sets the tone for the broader community. His unwillingness to engage respectfully or acknowledge the consequences of his actions compromises the experience and access issues for all of us who value this mountain.
Sunseri’s current defense hinges on legal technicalities, shifting blame to others and pointing fingers at past infractions to justify his own. But this isn’t about what others have done — it’s about the standard we set moving forward. Even if he is found not legally culpable, the ethical breach remains. At a minimum, he’s claiming a victory he didn’t deserve, and at its worst, he’s helped create an entitlement atmosphere that is dangerous in a high-stakes environment like the Grand Teton.
The Grand Teton has always been a place where people go to test their strength and character, and if it becomes acceptable to shortcut that challenge, then we all lose something. The current news narrative surrounding this incident has mostly focused on the legality of Sunseri’s actions. However, I think this misses why this situation has garnered so much public interest. This isn’t an isolated case of a runner who “mistakenly” took the wrong trail; it has come to symbolize the reorganizing of group norms away from the higher values of mutual cooperation and towards the baser instincts of self-advancement. Much like what we are seeing play out in national politics. 
To be clear, I don’t relish the idea of anyone being suspended from Grand Teton National Park. I know how vital time in nature is for mental health, reflection and joy. But when someone repeatedly denies wrongdoing, disregards the rules and promotes these ideals to North Face’s massive 5-million-follower audience — it’s difficult to feel sympathy. Especially when, by his own admission in text messages presented during his trial, Sunseri admitted beforehand that cutting switchbacks would set a bad precedent. That’s likely why, on his previous training runs up the Grand — still publicly visible on Strava — he stuck to the legal trail.
If Sunseri decides to return to the Grand Teton and try again, I wish him the best of luck, as I have always greatly admired any athlete who achieves their goals in a fair and honest way. But before that, I hope he can apologize to the National Park Service — the stewards of the wilderness he claims to care for. Most people, myself included, are willing to forgive a misstep. But it’s hard to move forward when no accountability is taken. Sunseri’s legacy as a respected mountain runner can still be salvaged — if he finds the courage to say, “I’m sorry. I made a mistake.”

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man Trump Administration officials wrongly deported to a Salvadoran prison, is scheduled to be arraigned today in a downtown Nashville courtroom as immigrant rights advocates, union leaders and clergy gather at a nearby church in a show of support and protest.
Abrego Garcia will have the opportunity to enter a plea to two criminal charges of alien smuggling. A magistrate judge will also consider the government’s arguments to detain Abrego Garcia until trial. 
His court-appointed public defenders, filing their first written response to the government’s criminal case on Wednesday, argued Abrego Garcia should remain free until his trial date, which has not yet been set. The attorneys’ 20-page legal filing focused largely on the government’s controversial actions to date.
“With no legal process whatsoever, the United States government illegally detained and deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia and shipped him to the Center for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT) in El Salvador, one of the most violent, inhumane prisons in the world. The government now asks this Court to detain him further,” they wrote.
Federal prosecutors in Nashville ask judge to keep Abrego Garcia detained until trial

“Mr. Abrego Garcia asks the Court for what he has been denied in the past several months — due process.”
The fate of Abrego Garcia has been central to public pushback over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics, which have since spilled into a days-long protest in Los Angeles. The Trump administration responded by activating the National Guard and U.S. Marines.
Immigrant rights advocates, clergy and union leaders are expected to gather in solidarity with Abrego Garcia today at a downtown church near the federal courthouse “to defend due process, protect vulnerable communities, and expose the dangerous authoritarianism driving these abuses.”  
On Saturday, while a military parade and celebration of President Donald Trump’s birthday take place in Washington, D.C., so-called “No Kings” protests of the Trump administration’s immigration and other policies are planned across the country, including more than a dozen in Tennessee.  
Abrego Garcia was driving home with his five-year-old son when was pulled over in March. Within days, he was dispatched to an El Salvador prison along with scores of other detainees.
‘A stain on the Constitution’: Abrego Garcia lawyers refuse to drop his case against U.S.

An immigrant from El Salvador, Abrego Garcia illegally came to the U.S. as a teen. In 2019 an immigration court issued an order that allowed him to reside in the United States while his immigration case was considered. The order specifically barred the federal government from deporting him to El Salvador, where, he said, he feared gang violence. 
A Trump administration attorney later admitted his deportation to El Salvador in March was in error.
In April, the Supreme Court ordered the federal government to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return. 
It wasn’t until Friday that Abrego Garcia was ultimately returned to the United States to face two criminal charges in Nashville. 
The charges are tied to a 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County, about 80 miles east of Nashville. 
Abrego Garcia was not arrested or charged in the stop, but federal prosecutors now allege that a subsequent investigation uncovered his ties to the MS-13 gang and a scheme to smuggle migrants illegally around the country for financial gain. 
Prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee argued in legal filings this week that Abrego Garcia should remain in detention until trial because of the seriousness of the alleged crimes.

His alleged human smuggling activities involved children at times, his alleged gang affiliation makes him — and gang associates — a danger to potential witnesses and the potential sentence he faces makes him a flight risk, they sayProsecutors also argued that Abrego Garcia faces certain deportation to El Salvador if convicted, giving him further motivation to flee.
Defense attorneys said allegations of Abrego Garcia’s gang affiliations are “baseless” and noted that he has not been charged with a crime that involves a minor victim.
Abrego Garcia has no prior felony convictions and no history of evading arrest or intimidating witnesses, they wrote.
And, they wrote, the government’s wrongful deportation of Abrego Garcia in March may give him a stronger claim in immigration proceedings to fight attempts to deport him once again should he be convicted. 
“Indeed, Mr Abrego Garcia was recently illegally deported to El Salvador and confined in a notoriously inhuman Salvadoran prison,” they wrote. 
“Thus, it appears he may now have a new basis (under either asylum law and/or the Convention Against Torture) to seek additional protection against deportation to El Salvador.”

(Photo: Tennessee Department of Corrections)The Tennessee Department of Correction will be reducing the number of inmates at privately-run Trousdale Turner in the wake of a prison riot that injured a staffer and inmates, according to state officials.
Republican Sen. Mark Pody told the Lookout he spoke with Correction Department officials after the incident last weekend in Hartsville where 2,690 state inmates are held.
“They’ve indicated they’re going to be reducing the number of prisoners at that facility,” Pody said. “We can’t have this. … There was somebody stabbed up there, and we need to make sure if somebody is incarcerated they are still safe.”
Department of Correction spokesperson Dorinda Carter confirmed that in response to the event some Trousdale Turner inmates will be moved to state-run prisons as part of a new “operational structure” the department is working on to ensure safety for staff and inmates.
Pody said he understood a staff member sustained a stab wound in the riot. A CoreCivic spokesman confirmed an officer was treated and released for a minor injury in the incident. Three inmates were treated for minor injuries as well.

The riot took place a day before Gov. Bill Lee signed a bill into law forcing the state’s private-prison operator to lower inmate populations in facilities with high death rates. 
The law by Pody and Republican Rep. Clark Boyd of Lebanon, requires inmate numbers to be reduced by 10% if the death rate there is twice as high as the rate at comparable state-run prisons. 
Set to take effect Sunday, the law shows how Republicans who hold a supermajority in the legislature are starting to take a closer look at the private-prison operator. 
“This was another unfortunate event,” Pody said.
In light of the riot and a federal probe into Trousdale Turner, Pody wants to renew a prison oversight panel that was nixed more than a decade ago, giving lawmakers more control over CoreCivic and the state’s prisons. 
The riot also revives questions about operations at Trousdale Turner where the company has struggled to hire officers and keep them.
An inmate reduction also could affect the company’s bottom line in Tennessee where it makes about $240 million annually to run four prisons and drew a nearly $7 million bump for cost increases this year. 
Criticism continues
The prison remains on lockdown during an investigation of the riot in which officers used chemical agents to force inmates out of an inner yard they commandeered and make them return to cells.
The incident is giving critics of privately-run prisons more proof to back their complaints.
“The recent events at Trousdale Turner Correctional Facility are as horrific as they are unsurprising and preventable,” said Matthew Charles, state legislative affairs manager of the nonprofit FAMM, which advocates for incarcerated people and their families. “Violence and chaos have pervaded Trousdale Turner since its opening in 2016. The people who live and work there fear for their lives on a daily basis.”
The U.S. Department of Justice started a civil rights investigation into Trousdale Turner last year based on reports showing high death rates and sexual violence, partly as a result of understaffing and constant turnover. FAMM, which urged the federal probe, has been advocating for independent prison oversight in Tennessee, Charles said, adding violence continues at Trousdale Turner despite the investigation.










The conditions at Trousdale Correction Facility have been horrific for a long time – nobody is safe there. Not the prisoners, not the guards, not the staff. CoreCivic has known about this, but they do nothing – because fixing isn’t profitable.


– Sen. Heidi Campbell, D-Nashville 


Andy Potter, executive director of One Voice United, another inmate advocacy group, said correctional officers and inmates are being put at risk.
“While the riot at Trousdale Turner was resolved without loss of life, this incident underscores the harsh reality of a correctional system pushed past its limits, suffering from chronic understaffing, insufficient training and a lack of oversight that has led to increasingly dangerous conditions,” Potter said in a statement.
CoreCivic said in a press release that Trousdale County Sheriff’s Department and Tennessee Highway Patrol helped its staff and the Tennessee Department of Correction quell the riot without serious injuries to inmates or officers.
The riot broke out Sunday when a group of inmates left their cells and gained access to an inner yard at the prison, destroying property, setting small fires and refusing to take orders from staff, according to CoreCivic.

No inmates tried to escape the facility, and the staff’s response did not involve a hostage situation, according to CoreCivic, which said it is “committed to operating safe and secure facilities that provide comprehensive, compassionate care” for inmates and staff. 
Yet Democratic state Sen. Heidi Campbell said she hears frequently from people who are “terrified” for loved ones being held at CoreCivic prisons. It oversees 8,150 inmates, more than a third of those in 12 state prisons.
“The conditions at Trousdale Correction Facility have been horrific for a long time – nobody is safe there. Not the prisoners, not the guards, not the staff. CoreCivic has known about this, but they do nothing – because fixing isn’t profitable,” Campbell said in a statement.
Amid the chaos, CoreCivic is lining up to win federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement contracts to detain immigrants, Campbell said.
While Democratic lawmakers have been warning about the consequences of using the private-prison operator for several years, mainly because of bad audits, Republican lawmakers are catching on.
Yet even as the state penalized the company $44.78 million since 2022 for contractual shortfalls on staffing, Correction Commissioner Frank Strada and Gov. Bill Lee show no signs of moving in a different direction. Lee, in fact, called CoreCivic an “important partner.”
Getting a boost?
Former Tennessee Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn visited Nashville this week with U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon, touring a charter school and meeting with officials to build support for an appointment to a federal post.
“During my visit to @Nshprep in Tennessee, I witnessed firsthand how their year-round learning cultivates sharp critical thinkers,” McMahon said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
Oddly enough, they didn’t invite the media, which normally is dragged along in hallways when Gov. Bill Lee visits local schools. It’s possible McMahon and Schwinn didn’t want to take questions from the press, which might have asked why the latter failed to report a new business, New Horizon BluePrint Group, on her federal conflict of interest disclosure, then dissolved it shortly before the U.S. Senate held her confirmation hearing for deputy secretary.

McMahon and her husband, Vince McMahon, started the company that morphed into World Wrestling Entertainment, apparently part of the criteria to earn a key post in the Trump Administration. (The president attended a rasslin’ event recently before sending troops to Los Angeles to quell protesters.)
Why anyone would want to take a position in the U.S. Education Department is puzzling, when half of America wants to get rid of it. Many of these experts say states should be in charge of education.
For the most part, they are, except for sections dealing with special education and the needs of low-income students. Tennessee sets its own curriculum for students, which could be the reason so many are struggling to read.
Targeting federal education
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti joined with a group called Students for Fair Admissions this week in filing an anti-discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education over its Hispanic-Serving Institution program, which provides federal funds for low-income students at colleges with at least 25% Hispanic students.
For instance, the University of Memphis is ineligible for the funds because it doesn’t have enough Hispanic students, even though 61% of its student population is made up of minorities, according to a release from Skrmetti’s office.
“A federal grant system that openly discriminates against students based on ethnicity isn’t just wrong and un-American – it’s unconstitutional,” Skrmetti said.
Tennessee’s attorney general is buoyed by the Supreme Court ruling that said Harvard University’s admission standards are racially discriminatory. He lumps this Hispanic program in with that one and adds, “Treating people differently because of their skin color and ancestry drags our country backwards.”
We can think of a lot of other things that push the nation back toward the 1800s. But there’s no need to replay the history of the 20th century.

Culture warrior
Shortly before announcing he would step down from Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District seat, U.S. Rep. Mark Green introduced one of those acronym bills that would take mere mortals years to coin.
The Ashland City area Republican who represents a portion of Nashville announced late last week he is sponsoring the Focusing Academies on Leadership and Cultivating Officers for National Security Act. Also known as the FALCONS Act, the bill is designed to execute an executive order by President Trump by removing courses that teach “radical gender ideology” and critical race theory.
A West Point graduate, Green said banning the teaching of Marxist theories at the military academy such as critical race theory and gender ideology will make sure “the primary focus remains not just how to fight, but what to fight for – liberty, the Constitution, representative government and our national defense.”

Green added he’s glad West Point removed a course called “Race, Ethnicity and Nation,” and another called “Power and Difference,” along with two on gender ideology.
The former Republican state senator concluded his opus by saying, “That all men are created equal is the self-evident truth at the heart of our nation,” contrary to the concept of critical race theory, which he said defines people by “immutable physical characteristics” and seeks to change historical wrongs through discrimination.
If that means “redlining” neighborhoods to stop banks from lending money to Black residents never took place, then maybe the concept should be eliminated. Unfortunately, it happened, and colleges could do our future military officers a favor by letting them know about this injustice.
But Green’s motive for sponsoring this bill when he’s set to step down after a vote on the president’s budget is hard to figure. Maybe it’s one last rage against the machine.
Insurrection or protest?
In advance of scheduled protests around Friday’s court hearing for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man inadvertently deported, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles is targeting groups that could be involved in the rally.
Ogles, who represents the heavily gerrymandered 5th Congressional District, said in an X post Wednesday that several non-government organizations named in a news article are “sponsoring an insurrection in Nashville this Friday” and asks a Republican data group to see if they receive government funds.
Garcia faces two criminal human smuggling charges connected to a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. He’s to be arraigned Friday at the federal courthouse in Nashville, and groups such as Service Employees International Union are to participate in a rally opposing his deportation and generally resisting Trump’s deportation policies.

To gain attention, Ogles might be trying to compare the groups with those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 and caused the deaths of multiple police officers while Trump and his entourage watched from a bunker. 
The main difference is the Nashville crowd will be raising a ruckus over immigration enforcement instead of trying to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power. 
Ogles is under fire for embellishing his resume and misleading the public with his Federal Election Commission reports, although Trump derailed that investigation. 
But this conflation of insurrection versus protestation could be bad for what we once called a nation.
The ultimate question is whether the president would pardon Nashville protesters as he did the Jan. 6 rioters.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Legislature wrapped up its 2025 regular session Thursday having passed an agenda to try to lower insurance rates with legislation that focused on consumers and so-called “tort reform” policy targeting personal injury lawyers on the belief they are the cause of the state’s high coverage premiums.
The agenda was part of what Gov. Jeff Landry promised to shepherd through the legislature as a “balanced approach” to the state’s insurance crisis. However, one of Landry’s latest actions — vetoing a tort reform bill Wednesday — has upset a member of his own party, Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Many. 
Seabaugh sponsored Senate Bill 111, which would have watered down Louisiana’s “bad faith” statute that holds insurance companies liable when they unreasonably delay or deny claims. Such practices made headlines in the wake of hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.
Landry snubbed Seabaugh’s bill, writing in his veto explanation that it would have allowed insurers to deny claims, refuse reasonable settlements and avoid accountability.
“If the legislature would like to make reasonable changes to the bad faith statute next year, I will gladly work with them over the next year to make those changes,” the governor said.
In an interview Thursday, Seabaugh expressed frustration with Landry, saying he felt blindsided by the veto because he thought he had the governor’s support. He contrasted Landry with former Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat.  
“John Bel would call and tell me when he vetoed a bill,” Seabaugh said. “Jeff didn’t.”
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said Landry also doesn’t speak to him before vetoing any legislation, though Henry did not express any frustration over it.
As for the rest of the approved insurance legislation, Henry said it lives up to the governor’s promise of a “balanced approach” to rein in both sides — insurance companies and trial lawyers — and their unpopular practices that have become the target of complaints from policyholders.
The Senate president said he wants to hold off on any additional reforms for a couple of years to see if the measures approved this session have any impact on policy rates. 
“That’s kind of a wait-and-see game,” Henry said, adding that laws the insurance industry backed last year are supposed to lower homeowner premiums but have so far not had any noticeable impact. 
Others are less confident that the new laws will do anything to lower insurance rates.
“I talked to people in the insurance industry who tell me none of this is gonna make rates go down,” Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, said, citing statements from the heads of tort reform associations. 
Another controversial measure became the center of a public feud between the governor and Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple.
Gov. Landry might get the insurance laws he wants, but not without ruffling some Republican feathers

House Bill 148 by Rep. Jeff Wiley, R-Maurepas, was among the first this session that Landry signed into law, gives the state insurance commissioner power to strike down any insurance rate increase considered “excessive” or unreasonably high. Prior to the change, the commissioner could only exercise that power after holding a public hearing in which someone proved the state insurance market lacks competition. 
Although Wiley sponsored the bill, the governor crafted the legislation with the help of two House Democrats and lobbied heavily for its passage, arguing that Temple wasn’t doing enough to regulate insurance rates. 
Temple and other critics argued that Landry is using the new law to try to deflect any blame voters might place on him for Louisiana’s insurance crisis. 
Wiley’s bill allows the public to review documents insurance companies file with the state when seeking a rate increase, but only if the insurance commissioner determines the information shouldn’t be kept confidential as a proprietary trade secret.
It takes effect on Aug. 1.
Included among the many insurance bills passed this session are:
Consumer-focused bills
House Bill 329 by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, allocates $5 million per year to the Louisiana Fortify Homes Program with fees collected from insurance companies. It will take effect July 1, 2026.
The program, managed by the Louisiana Department of Insurance, offers $10,000 grants to homeowners for the installation of hurricane-resistant roofs and has been effective at lowering homeowner insurance costs, according to a review by Louisiana Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack. 
Senate Bill 28 by Sen. Kirk Talbot, R-River Ridge, would give homeowners a nonrefundable income tax credit for up to $10,000 for out-of-pocket expenses used to pay for a fortified roof. Combined with an LDI grant, the new tax credit could allow more Louisiana homeowners to invest in fortified roofs. Talbot’s bill is pending approval of the governor.
House Bill 345 by Rep. John Wyble, R-Franklinton, requires a 60-day notice, up from 30 days, from an insurer to a policyholder prior to any cancellation or non-renewal of a homeowner policy except when termination of coverage is for nonpayment of premium. The bill is pending the governor’s consideration.
House Bill 496 by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, would give policyholders a pass protecting them from any rate increases tied to a lapse in auto coverage so long as the lapse doesn’t exceed 90 days. The bill would prohibit insurers from penalizing policyholders for a single instance of nonpayment during a five-year period. It received overwhelming bipartisan support from both chambers and is pending approval by the governor. 
Senate Bill 34 by Luneau would prohibit an insurance company from changing or altering the repair estimate filed by the adjuster originally assigned to the claim without that adjuster’s permission. It is pending approval by the governor. 
Pro-insurance, tort reform bills
House Bill 450, by Rep. Michael Melerine, R-Shreveport, ends the Housley presumption, a standard of evidence explained in a 1991 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that applies to auto accidents, medical malpractice and other injury lawsuits. In a nutshell, the Housley presumption says courts should assume a plaintiff’s injuries resulted from the accident in question if they were in good health beforehand.  
Lawmakers tried repeatedly to revoke the presumption in previous years, only to see their attempts fail or vetoed. Landry signed Melerine’s bill into law May 28, and it took effect immediately.
Lawmakers reject insurance bills that had direct relief for Louisiana homeowners

Senate Bill 231 by Sen. Mike Reese, R-Leesville, deals with a concept called “collateral source” that prevents civil defendants from admitting certain types of evidence into court, which critics say has allowed plaintiffs to sue for medical expenses they never actually had to pay. Reese’s bill would effectively undo that rule and could ultimately reduce the money plaintiffs can recover in auto accident lawsuits. It is pending consideration by the governor.
House Bill 431, by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, limits the ability for people to recover damages for injuries sustained in accidents for which they are mostly at fault. The bill changes Louisiana’s comparative fault statute, which assigns a percentage of blame to each party in an accident and allows for the recovery of damages in proportion with those percentages. 
Under prior law, a person partly at fault in an accident would be liable for their share of the damages and can recover the remaining amount found to be the fault of the other party. Chenevert’s bill changes that to prohibit recovery of any amount by a party who’s 51% or more at fault. It will take effect Jan. 1.
House Bill 436, by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, prohibits “unauthorized aliens” — defined in the measure as individuals illegally in the United States under federal immigration law — from receiving general damages stemming from auto accidents. General damages include compensation for pain and suffering, but the proposal would still allow recovery for “special damages” such as medical expenses and property damage. It will take effect Aug. 1.
House Bill 291, sponsored by Rep. Jay Gallé, R-Mandeville, would extend the filing deadline, called a “prescriptive period,” for wrongful death lawsuits from one year to two, aligning Louisiana with the deadline in most other states. It does not apply to medical malpractice cases.
Proponents of the bill have argued a shorter prescriptive period attracts more tenuous lawsuits by essentially forcing people to quickly file claims so as to not lose their litigation rights. The proposal, which awaits the governor’s consideration, also complements a similar measure lawmakers approved last year to extend the deadline for filing personal injury claims.

Collins, Colorado. (Neil Palmer/USDA)Where do the seeds you plant on your farm or garden come from? Why does it matter? The Snake River Seed Cooperative is hitting the road this summer to bring organic seed production education to Idaho producers large and small, thanks to a grant from the USDA’s Transition to Organic Partnership Program, or TOPP. 
Seedsman Bill McDorman famously said, “When you plant a seed, you plant the entire agricultural system that produced that seed.” 
Less than 100 years ago, virtually all farms in the country saved some or most of their own seeds. Now, nearly all the seed planted on Idaho farms and gardens is trucked in from off-farm, increasing input costs and reducing farm self-sufficiency. Further, mass-produced seeds supplied by global supply chains often lack regional adaptations and diverse genetics that will allow those seeds to withstand increasingly erratic local weather conditions. 


Want to learn more?
Email Casey O’Leary at casey.snakervierseeds@gmail.com with questions about the Seed Circus or Seed School.


Snake River Seed Cooperative is on a mission grow a robust regional seedshed for the Intermountain West. The co-op works with small farmers and gardeners around the region to reclaim this vital skill, increasing the region’s seed sovereignty and resilience by rebuilding our regional seed infrastructure and getting more organically-grown, locally-adapting seed into more Idaho farms and gardens.  
Amid trade wars and uncertain global markets, farmers are increasingly turning to the certified organic domestic market as an alternative outlet for their crops — one that promises higher prices while safeguarding their local watershed and ecosystem. Certified organic farms must purchase and use certified organic seed where available, giving certified organic seed producers a competitive edge in the market. 
Each stop on the traveling seed circus will feature a field day at one of our certified organic Snake River Seed Co-op grower’s farms. These farms are some of the most successful small-scale, direct-market agricultural enterprises in the state, including several of the founding farms who helped to create the organic program in Idaho in the 1990s. Each stop will include a light meal, opportunities to learn from experienced growers, and network with others. 
“We are thrilled to host the Treasure Valley Seed School field day at our farm because everyone interested in agriculture and sustainability should be empowered to participate,” says Jackie Sommer of Purple Sage Farms in Middleton. “Learning new skills that help the local community, building connections with like-minded individuals and the land, as well as creating food security and independence, is essential. Local, organic agriculture that invigorates soil ecosystems and strives to grow nutrient rich plants is the answer for our future.” 










Delving into the science of seed production, harvesting and successful germination is one of the great adventures in gardening. This is an opportunity to understand what local growers have learned over years of practice.


– Diane Jones, Draggin’ Wing High Desert Nursery and Seed School guest speaker


Field days will be followed by a two-day Seed School, a deep dive into the world of organic seed production. Participants will learn seed saving basics, get hands-on practice with cleaning seeds, explore the larger seed industry and the opportunities and limitations contained within it, and connect with others who are working to strengthen our regional food and seed systems. 
While the basic educational components will be similar across the various schools, the seed school in each region of our agriculturally-diverse state also features additional field trips and guest speakers, and local food and beverage purveyors unique to that region. 
In total, the seed circus will connect attendees with over 30 different Idaho organizations and individuals who are playing a vital part in rebuilding our regional seedshed, including farmers, millers, bakers, brewers, governmental and public seed entities, native plant and seed producers, and more. 
Each of the people who attends seed school becomes woven into the network of people skilling up to rebuild our regional seedshed. 
People are so eager for connection and community right now. We keep hearing from folks who are feeling increasingly isolated and also increasingly anxious about what the future will bring, and they’re looking for something they can tangibly DO to make a difference. 
Learning to save some of your own seeds is hopeful, but it’s not just abstractly hopeful. It’s incredibly powerful. It literally roots our communities. It grows and feeds us healthy food, and gives us something to share with each other. And also, it’s fun and mind-blowing and interesting — that’s the stuff that makes me happy to be alive!

(Getty Images)This story discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. 
When transgender Americans experience discrimination — like being harassed or denied equal services and medical care — they’re more likely to have poor mental health, a new report shows.
“Health and Wellbeing: Findings from the 2022 US Trans Survey,” released by the Advocates for Trans Equality Education Fund this week, includes insights from surveying 84,170 trans adults across the United States.
The report doesn’t break down results by state, but the organization said that transgender Americans in all states and Washington, D.C., participated in the survey in 2022. Questions covered general health and access to health care, transition related care, sexual and reproductive health, mental health, life satisfaction and happiness and substance use.
Ankit Rastogi, the director of research at Advocates for Trans Equality, said during a Tuesday press conference that the organization conducts the survey because “the best way to learn about trans people is to ask trans people.”

“We need social acceptance and family support and the ability to live our lives authentically in public safely,” Rastogi said. “These are all means to create better health and well-being among trans people.”
Among other findings, the report shows:

Trans people who have supportive family members reported lower rates of suicidality than those without support. Among those with no victimization, 31% reported considering  suicide in the past year, lower than the 50% for those who were verbally harassed, 53% for those who were denied equal treatment and 63% for those who were physically assaulted.
Older Americans surveyed reported better health than younger respondents with 78% of those 65 and older vs. 60% of 18-24-year-olds rating their health as good or better.
About 84% wanted gender-affirming care and about 60% received it.
Trust in health care providers was higher in 2022 than in 2015, when the organization last conducted the survey, with half of respondents saying all their providers knew they were transgender compared to 40% in 2015. Many health care providers were supportive of their trans patients. early 3 in 4 (73%) respondents who disclosed their transgender status to their provider reported they felt treated with respect by at least one provider — higher than the 62% in 2015.
Despite greater trust in medical  providers, trans individuals still put off seeing a health care provider because they fear they’ll be disrespected. The survey shows this is true for 32% of trans men and 20% of trans women.
The fear of mistreatment isn’t unwarranted. The survey shows 47% of gender non-conforming Americans had negative experiences with health care providers in the 12 months leading up to their survey.

Olivia Hunt, the organization’s director of federal policy, said the survey results can offer policy makers and the general public a better understanding of what it means to be a transgender person in America.

“Over the past decade, the idea of trans people has become something that’s more and more prominent in the media and popular consciousness,” Hunt said during the Tuesday press conference. “But unfortunately, to most people, including those lawmakers and policymakers that I and my team meet with so often, trans people ourselves are just an abstract idea, an idea that’s based on stereotypes and assumptions and often incredibly inaccurate pop culture representations of trans people.”
Involvement in advocacy, Hunt said, will help make “trans people real” rather than a composite of a stereotypical character.
And, she said, “having real, concrete and rigorous data about the realities of trans people’s day to day lives” helps to dispel misinformation.
“Trans people live all around the country. We’re not just a community that exists in some sort of abstract ‘somewhere else.’ We’re in every state and territory, in towns and cities from coast to coast, and almost certainly in every single congressional district,” Hunt said. “That’s something that I think is still not really there in the public consciousness.”

Since 2020, 36 states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery department. In rural counties, the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, less prenatal care and higher rates of babies being born too early. (John Moore | Getty Images)Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.
Births are expensive
The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.










You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services.


– Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform


“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
Ripple effects
Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
State action
Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

(Getty Images)West Virginia elected officials this week celebrated proposals from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to roll back regulations on emissions from power plants that advocates worry will threaten public health as well as the environment.
The standards the EPA is looking to ease require existing coal-fired and new natural gas power plants to cut 90% of carbon emissions and tightens emission standards for toxic metals like mercury from coal-fired power plants by 70%.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin officially announced the proposed regulatory changes at a news conference Wednesday, where he was joined by Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va, among other congressional representatives from across the country.
Zeldin said the regulations are responsible for increased power costs. Loosening them, he believes, could lower power bills for households across the nation.
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told West Virginia Public Broadcasting Wednesday that she was “thrilled” about the proposed changes as she has “long opposed” the standards because of potentially “devastating economic impacts” and “energy reliability concerns.”
Gov. Patrick Morrisey, in a news release Wednesday, called the EPA’s proposal a “major victory” for West Virginia. 
“These rules were a direct assault on our coal communities, designed to force a rapid transition away from fossil fuels by imposing unworkable emissions standards on existing power plants,” Morrisey said. “This action by Administrator Zeldin restores constitutional order and delivers long-overdue relief to states like West Virginia that have been unfairly targeted for years.”
As the state’s attorney general, Morrisey successfully argued to the Supreme Court of the United States in a 2022 decision that the EPA lacks the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions by changing standards for existing plants without action by Congress.
“We kept fighting and ultimately won at the highest court in West Virginia v. EPA, a decisive ruling that reaffirmed what we had argued all along: major policy decisions like reshaping our energy grid must come from Congress, not from unelected federal bureaucrats,” Morrisey said Wednesday.
The regulations being targeted by the EPA now were enacted through separate acts under President Barack Obama in 2015 and President Joe Biden in 2024. Zeldin on Wednesday emphasized that, at this point, the changes are only proposed. The public will have 45 days to comment on the changes.
Through the rollbacks, the EPA is questioning whether emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants actually “significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution.” Since the pollutants are “global in nature,” according to the agency, “any potential public health harms have not been accurately attributed to emissions from the U.S. power sector.”
Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — as well as other greenhouse gases — are known to be the leading cause of climate change worldwide as they trap heat in the atmosphere which warms the planet. They are also known to increase air pollution and smog, contributing to asthma and other respiratory conditions for people who live in places with high concentrations of them in the air.
“Corporate polluters with access to the Trump administration make more money when they don’t have to worry about protecting our communities’ health, but the rest of us in Appalachia and across the country will feel the negative impacts,” said Chelsea Barnes, the director of government affairs at Appalachian Voices, a regional environmental advocacy group. “This action by the EPA, paired with the broad cancellation of billions of dollars in federal grants meant to help people clean up pollution and congressional and agency efforts to skip and eliminate environmental review for new polluting projects, will undoubtedly make Americans less healthy and less safe.”
According to the Sierra Club, coal plants in Kentucky, West Virginia and Southeastern Ohio could see a 72% increase in carbon emissions if the current standards are repealed.
West Virginia is home to several of the nation’s highest greenhouse gas emitters. In 2023, the state was the 12th highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the country, per data from the EPA. Power plants, according to the EPA data, were the largest emitter in the state, accounting for 72.25% of all emissions from 13 different facilities. 
The state’s Harrison Power Station — which is operated by Mon Power, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. — was the ninth highest emitter of greenhouse gases nationally in 2023, releasing about 11.18 million metric tons of greenhouse gases into the environment.
Carbon dioxide was by far the highest emitted greenhouse gas, with 52.3 million metric tons — about 81% of all emissions — coming from 113 facilities in West Virginia. According to the data, there were also 11.4 million metric tons of methane released by West Virginia facilities and 233,038 metric tons of nitrous oxide released in 2023.

As long as the United States is going to maintain immigration laws, it’s a given that unauthorized people will be subject to arrest and deportation. This fact is not terribly controversial.
That said, there should be enormous controversy over the way federal officials are now carrying out this work.
Simply put: we don’t have secret police in the United States. Or at least we shouldn’t.
Unfortunately, it’s hard to describe Trump administration immigration enforcement actions in any other way.
Time and again in recent months – here in North Carolina and around the nation — masked individuals in unmarked vehicles have swooped in and spirited people away to undisclosed locations.
And whatever the alleged status or crime of these arrested people – this is just plain wrong and un-American.
The bottom line: It’s a fundamental premise of the U.S. Constitution that no person in our country can be deprived of liberty without due process. When government starts evading this guarantee – even for non-citizens — it places all of our freedoms in grave jeopardy.

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Thursday saw several major issues come to the floor, with the Maine Senate and House of Representatives taking up more than a dozen gun bills. Additionally, the Senate voted on two bills related to transgender rights, arguably the most contentious topic this session, while the chambers backed proposals to increase taxes on corporations and top earners.
With papers frantically shuffling between chambers this week ahead of the planned June 18 adjournment, Maine Morning Star will highlight the biggest items of debate as well as legislation and issues that we’ve followed all session.
Here’s an overview of what else happened Thursday. 
Both chambers
After the House voted 76-71 on Thursday, both chambers have now backed a measure (LD 913) that would prohibit ticket sellers from banning the transfer of tickets to third parties. 
The Senate on Thursday followed the House in backing LD 172, which would require the Maine State Police to create a statewide list of missing persons and study improvements for investigating those cases, but then moved to table the measure. (Read more about this issue here). 
With the Senate voting 19-16, the majority of both chambers support a proposal (LD 648) to expand the state’s supervised community confinement program for incarcerated people who committed offenses before they were 26 years old. 
Nonconcurrent matters
The Senate on Thursday insisted on its support of a proposal (LD 1200), rejected by the House Wednesday, that would prohibit the sale of items intended to be used to inhale nitrous oxide for recreational use. 
Senate action
Voting without a roll call, the Senate passed legislation (LD 1955) that establishes several new programs to help support and incentivize people to become early childhood educators and providers. It also requires the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a plan for the long-term sustainability of the Maine Child Care Affordability Program. Introducing her bill, Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) said it is about “supporting the workforce behind our workforce.”
The Senate voted 20-15 on legislation that would establish a moratorium on the sale of mobile home parks. During debate, Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) explained the pause would allow some of the other bills that passed protecting mobile home owners to take effect.
An emergency bill (LD 1986) from the governor to fund collective bargaining agreements for judicial branch employees passed the Senate, with members agreeing to skip the committee process to advance the legislation.
The Senate voted without a roll call to back a plan (LD 1669) to establish the Cannabis Advisory Council, to make recommendations to the head of the state Office of Cannabis Policy, as well the Legislature, on matters related to the industry and policy.
House action
Legislation (LD 1164 ) that would give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine passed the House 85-59. During debate, Passamaquoddy Tribal Rep. Aaron Dana said the bill offers hope and opportunity not just for tribal communities but for rural Maine. He added that it’s ultimately about long-overdue economic inclusion.

The Kentucky Democratic Party begins its annual state convention Friday evening in Owensboro with the Forward Together Dinner. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin will speak along with Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman. 

Despite decades of setbacks — most recently the defection of a longtime lawmaker — Kentucky Democrats, gathering this weekend in Owensboro for their annual convention, see a chance to reclaim some rural voters thanks to Republican actions under President Donald Trump.
“I mean, for all its imperfections, the Democratic Party, in my opinion, is the best path that we have right now to stand up for working people and defend health care and push back against the forces trying to erode basic truth and fairness in government,” said McClain Dyer, vice chair of the Carter County Democratic Party.
Dyer’s state senator, Robin Webb of Grayson, recently became the latest in a long line of Appalachian politicians switching from Democrat to Republican. The change also makes her part of the GOP supermajority that controls the Kentucky legislature.
“I represent my district,” Webb told the Lantern in an interview. “I’ve always been pretty party blind, but I try to represent the will of my district, and I’m going to continue to do that. Party affiliation is not going to affect the way I represent my people. I’m going to represent everybody.”
Webb, an attorney and former coal miner, said Democratic Party positions on coal, guns and allowing transgender women to compete in women’s sports had alienated voters in her Northeastern Kentucky district, which includes Boyd, Carter, Greenup and Lewis counties. 
Republican Trump not only won all but Kentucky’s two largest counties for the second time in November 2024, he also expanded his margins of victory in the state’s rural areas.
Still, Prestonsburg attorney Ned Pillersdorf says Republican plans, endorsed by Trump, to slash the social safety net provide Democrats with an opening.

Pillersdorf is so optimistic about Democrats’ chances in next year’s mid-term elections that he is considering challenging Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers of Somerset, who has held Kentucky’s 5th Congressional District seat for 44 years, often running unopposed or with a token Democratic opponent.
Pillersdorf told the Lantern he’s likely to announce a run for Rogers’ seat on July 4.
Rogers’ district is one of the nation’s poorest and one of the most dependent on Medicaid. Almost half of Rogers’ constituents — 44% — rely on the state-federal program to pay for their health care and it has been critical to sustaining hospital services in Eastern Kentucky.
Rogers voted in favor of the Trump-endorsed spending and tax plan that would make the largest cuts to Medicaid in its history. The bill is projected to cut federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion and reduce spending to help people afford health insurance by $268 billion over a decade.



‘None of the above’ gains steam in Bluegrass State
In the competition for new Kentucky voters, both major political parties are trailing “other.”
Secretary of State Michael Adams recently announced that Kentuckians registering to vote under “other” political affiliations have outnumbered Republican and Democratic registrations combined for three straight months.
“As the Democrats move further left and the Republicans move further right, more voters are registering as Independent,” said Adams. “Kentucky has a large and growing political center; candidates should take note and court this growing bloc of voters.” 
Despite “other’s” progress, the major parties still claim the most voters by far. Kentucky has almost 1.6 million registered Republicans — 47% of the electorate. Registered Democrats number almost 1.4 million or 42%.
Kentucky has registered 361,168 voters under other political affiliations, making up 11% of the electorate, according to Adams’ office. 


Rogers defended his support for the bill, saying, “I did not take this vote lightly.” He said the bill would protect Medicaid for poor Eastern Kentuckians by removing illegal immigrants and ineligible recipients from the rolls.

Pillersdorf said Eastern Kentuckians also are worried about funding for local programs. Letcher County Schools planned to use its remaining $3 million in pandemic relief funding to replace 25 school buses lost during 2022 floods, but Trump’s U.S. Department of Education nixed the reimbursement. The Trump administration canceled a grant to the Hindman Settlement School in Knott County that was to support reading and math intervention programs.
Pillersdorf said Democrats have long had a problem of appearing like the “coastal elite party,” as national leaders are often from New York or California, but he said growing concern about cuts to “social safety net” programs is a chance to “regain the confidence of rural voters.” 
“I think if those issues are front and center, the Democrats are going to regain ground quickly,” he said. 
Pillersdorf is married to former state Supreme Court Justice Janet Stumbo and helped run her nonpartisan campaigns. He also has prominently championed the clients of convicted fraudster Eric Conn after the Social Security Administration tried to end their disability benefits.
State v. national party brand

Michael Adams, Kentucky’s Republican secretary of state, said Kentucky Democrats share a problem with Vermont Republicans — their party’s national brand. Democratic presidential candidates typically win Vermont, a reliably blue state, but Republican Gov. Phil Scott has won five elections. In Kentucky, it’s been 28 years since a Democratic presidential candidate carried the state, but Democrats have held the governorship for all but eight of those 28 years.
For most of modern Kentucky history, Democrats controlled Frankfort, but now they hold a superminority in both the state House and Senate. Nearly all of them are elected from Louisville and Lexington, the state’s largest cities. 
In July 2022, registered Republican voters outnumbered Democrats for the first time in Kentucky
Adams said that Democrats as a whole have “been moving away from the New Deal coalition of farmers, working class laborers” and toward a professional class. Meanwhile, Republicans have made gains with voters in those traditionally Democratic categories. 
“The two parties are trading voters, basically trading parts of their coalition to each other, and so that’s really outside the Kentucky Democratic Party’s power to do anything about. That’s not their fault,” Adams said. “The question is, how do they respond to that? And how can they separate their state brand from the national brand?”
  Sen. Robin Webb (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
Pillersdorf said party leaders have had discussions about spending money on elections in what are perceived as “unwinnable districts” for Democrats — including Kentucky’s 5th Congressional District.
“I agree with the old Howard Dean approach,” he said, referring to the strategy of the former Democratic National Committee chair and Vermont governor. “We need to compete everywhere. We should not concede an inch of ground.” 
To that end, Kentucky Democratic Party leaders have been traveling the state in recent months, trying to engage voters in what they call a rural listening tour. 
Webb, the state senator, said the effort is “about 20 years too late.”
“For those of us who have been the rural voice and been minimized and marginalized and excluded and not listened to, it’s too little, too late to acknowledge rural voters,” she said.

Two years earlier, she was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer of the uterus. She had a heart that loved so many, and a heart that so many loved.
Her prognosis wasn’t good. But she wasn’t ready to die. And no one who loved her was ready for that either. She survived multiple surgeries, multiple rounds of chemo and radiation, multiple days of feeling like garbage, multiple hair losses, multiple doctor’s appointments, multiple medications, multiple treatments, and multiple clinical trials.
The last year of her life she lived trial to trial, and she lived because of those trials. Those clinical trials allowed her access to new drugs, new therapies, new treatments that promised to give her more days on this Earth. And thank God they did. After each trial did the magic it was designed to do, she had to find a new trial that would give her a little more time. Each trial could only do so much.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
I remember her wife texting me with remarkable relief after they found out she qualified for a new trial. Sending tissue samples to renowned clinics to apply for another trial. Waiting. Then getting the call saying she was eligible, and loading up their 7-year-old in the minivan to drive five hours for the new treatment.
The trials ran out about the same time her body and soul did. But they gave her, and all of us, time we knew was borrowed, and yet, time that let our hearts grow in entirely new ways.
As a scientist, I’ve always known how important research, grants and clinical trials are on a scientific and public health level. Watching them save my friend’s life, give her three more years, cemented my vocation.
Like many, I became a researcher and scientist of health to alleviate suffering. Every new grant, every new study, every new discovery, every new breakthrough has a similar premise: to ease the suffering of people from a variety of illnesses, conditions and behaviors. To find ways to make people’s lives easier, and more meaningful in the face of illness. To find ways to give people more time with their loved ones and time to do what they love. To find ways to let people live as well as possible for as long as possible. It’s impossible to separate these things.
The National Institutes of Health has been our vehicle for doing this for decades. Its work has saved millions of people’s lives — people you and I love and who love us deeply. Someone once told me that we used the wrong words for the NIH — that it should be called the National Institutes of Hope.
I smiled. That’s it. These institutes, in their effort to alleviate suffering, are often our only pathways to help when someone we love receives a horrific diagnosis:
When your best friend receives a terminal diagnosis at 40.
When your child is told their heart is not strong enough.
When your spouse is given a Stage III breast cancer diagnosis.
When your husband is told he has early prostate cancer.
When your dad is told he has advanced bladder cancer.
When your sister has a stroke and needs to learn to walk again.
When your 18-year-old kid is told they have Type 2 diabetes.
When your cousin is dealing with opioid addiction and suicidal.
When your brother is told he has a rare autoimmune disease.
When a friend from college who is an avid runner is told she has multiple sclerosis in her 30s.
When your mom — a widow — is diagnosed with dementia, and she can’t remember who you are when you walk in the door.
This is the heartbeat of what the NIH does — to make these experiences, and so many more, a little less horrific.
Every one of the 2,500 grants terminated since January is 2,500 terminations of hope, 2,500 terminations for those living with serious illness, 2,500 openings for unnecessary suffering.
It should not be this way. It cannot be this way. We cannot stay silent. Too many lives are already at risk. We need the NIH. We need every scientist in every part of this country to pursue their unique and lifesaving research so we all can live as well as possible for as long as possible.
You can’t make America healthy without a strong National Institutes of Health.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The parade of annual increases in Rhode Island’s hourly minimum wage is poised to march on for two more years under companion bills approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly Tuesday. 
The legislation sponsored by Democratic Rep. David Bennett, of Warwick, and Sen. John Burke, of West Warwick, increase the existing, $15 hourly minimum wage to $16 starting Jan. 1, 2026, rising to $17 on Jan. 1, 2027. 
Both chambers approved the wage hike in separate votes divided mostly along party lines — 55-10 in the House, and 33-4 in the Senate. All four Senate Republicans voted against the bill while nine of 10 House Republicans opposed it; the final House Republican, Rep. Robert Quattrocchi, of Scituate, was absent.
Democratic Rep. Jacquelyn Baginski of Cranston also voted against the wage increase.
Each chamber must rubber stamp the other’s bill under a process known as concurrence before the proposal can be signed into law. Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not immediately return inquiries for comment Thursday.
Originally, an annual $1-per-year increase in base pay would have continued through the end of the decade, culminating in $20-an-hour in 2030.
But backlash from business groups and economic uncertainty led to what Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat and chair of the House Committee on Labor, termed a “more measured approach” — only prescribing annual wage hikes for the next two years rather than five.
“I would urge my colleagues to vote for this very common sense, measured response regarding increasing the minimum wage,” Corvese said.
His plea did not persuade Republican lawmakers, who echoed business owners concerns’ that higher wages would cut into small business bottom lines, and, potentially, force layoffs.
“The real minimum wage is $0,” said House Minority Whip David Place, a Burrillville Republican. “That’s what they make when they get fired because business can’t afford to keep them.”
Consumers could suffer, too, warned Rep. Paul Santucci, a Smithfield Republican. Santucci took an informal survey of owners of four local restaurants, a farm, a nursing home and a repair shop. All told him they would likely have to raise their prices if base wages increase, Santucci said Thursday.
“For small business owners, policies that continually increase labor costs will force them to make difficult decisions,” the Rhode Island Business Coalition wrote in a March 5 letter to lawmakers. “They may be forced to cut jobs and/or reduce their employees’ hours, if they are not forced to close entirely. Rising labor costs may also increase the speed at which employers decide to invest in technology to replace lower-wage workers. This means fewer jobs for Rhode Island workers, and ultimately undermines the progress our economy needs to make.”
The coalition in its letter also pointed out that Rhode Island already has the seventh highest hourly minimum wage in the country — accompanied by Massachusetts —  having hiked the base pay for hourly workers in eight of the last nine years.
Sen. Leonidas Raptakis framed Rhode Island’s high ranking as a benefit, rather than a detriment, noting that the Ocean State’s hourly base pay ranked 14th in 2013, before lawmakers began a series of regular minimum wage hikes.
“If we do this today, we’re going to be number 6, then maybe in 2017, we’ll be number 5,” said Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat and former small business owner.
Raptakis unsuccessfully proposed two amendments on the Senate floor Thursday: one to raise the minimum wage to $17 immediately, with subsequent increases based upon the consumer price index, and a second to create a legislative study panel on the topic.  Both amendments failed.
Earlier in the session, progressive Democratic Rep. Enrique Sanchez also suggested an alternative, proposing a $22 hourly minimum starting Jan. 1, which failed to gain enough traction to advance out of committee. Addressing colleagues Thursday, Sanchez backed the less-severe $1 boost to hourly wages as “good progress.”
“This is common sense legislation,” Sanchez said. “The reality is that inflation is still high, and we need to make sure our Rhode Islanders are getting paid sufficient wages in order to maintain their lifestyles and support their families at home.”
Majority Whip Katherine Kazarian, an East Providence Democrat, also noted that business owners routinely implore lawmakers to make policies that are predictable and standardized.
“This does exactly that,” Kazarian said.
Union groups, medical professionals and advocates for child and family wellbeing previously expressed support for raising the state’s minimum wage, which they said would boost purchasing power, reduce poverty and lead to better health outcomes.
Lawmakers last updated the state’s minimum wage rate in 2021, approving a set of annual increases that increased hourly rates by $3.50 over a four-year period.
Separate proposals to increase the tipped minimum wage for servers and other hospitality workers — either a one-year bump to $6.75 an hour or gradually to reach $15 hourly by 2031 —  remained held for review in committee in each chamber as of Thursday afternoon. Rhode Island has not updated its $3.89 hourly minimum wage for workers who receive tips since 2017.

Too many haven’t,” Attorney General Jason Miyares said in an interview with The Mercury this week. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)As protests erupt again in Los Angeles over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and President Donald Trump’s deployment of U.S. Marines to back up the National Guard, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares isn’t blinking.
“It’s not unprecedented,” Miyares, who is seeking a second term as Virginia’s top law enforcement official, said of Trump’s decision to send troops to the streets. “President George H.W. Bush did it in 1992 during the L.A. riots. Twice the number of Marines were deployed then.”
In a wide-ranging interview at his office in Richmond earlier this week, Miyares, the son of a Cuban refugee and the first Hispanic Virginian elected statewide, insisted that what’s happening in California is the result of leadership failure. 
“This is about protecting facilities and backing up law enforcement — not policing,” he said, emphasizing that peaceful protest is a hallmark of democracy, but violence is not. “When you cross the line … that is not protest, that is violence.”
In the interview, Miyares defended the use of force in Los Angeles, spoke at length about his office’s crime-fighting initiatives and touted settlements with corporate polluters and opioid makers. He also fielded questions on civil rights enforcement, voting access, utility regulation and his complex views on criminal justice reform. 
Democrats, not surprisingly, remain deeply skeptical of Miyares’ record. 
Carolyn Fiddler, spokeswoman for the Democratic Attorneys General Association, dismissed his claims of prioritizing public safety. 
“Throughout his time as AG, MAGA Miyares continuously put politics before people,” Fiddler said in an email. “While he touts his ‘tough on crime’ stance, he’s failed to call out Donald Trump and Elon Musk for blatant violations of the law — including those actions with devastating impacts on the commonwealth. Virginians deserve better than Miyares, and we will take back the seat this year.”
And while critics accuse him of being more focused on punishment than reform, Miyares says his approach is guided by listening, law enforcement feedback, and a “victim-first” mindset.
 From Virginia Beach to the statewide stage

Born in Greensboro, North Carolina and raised in Virginia Beach, Miyares, 49, earned his law degree from the College of William & Mary and worked as a prosecutor before running for office. 
In 2015, he became the first Cuban American elected to Virginia’s General Assembly. Six years later, he unseated Democratic incumbent Mark Herring to become attorney general, winning on a platform centered around public safety.
Now, as he runs for reelection, Miyares is highlighting what he calls some of the biggest public safety and civil litigation wins in Virginia history. But he’s also navigating internal GOP rifts, pressure from both the right and the center, and a polarized electorate that’s increasingly skeptical of tough-on-crime rhetoric.
“I think one of the most important things for a leader to do is just listen,” Miyares said.
Since taking office in 2022, Miyares has zeroed in on violent crime. He calls Operation Ceasefire, a grant-driven program launched in 13 Virginia cities, one of his proudest achievements. The initiative funds a mix of prevention, intervention, and prosecution strategies aimed at repeat violent offenders.
“We saw a 66% drop in the murder rate across the 13 cities,” Miyares said. “Virginia’s statewide murder rate fell by a third. We also saw a decline in overdose deaths — because we’re getting fentanyl dealers off the street.”
The program, he insists, is based on listening tours he conducted with police and community leaders around the state. “Roughly 5% of felons commit over 50% of violent crimes. If you want to lower crime, you go after that small subset.”
Still, sustaining the initiative may prove difficult amid budget fights. “I wish we could expand Operation Ceasefire to more cities,” Miyares acknowledged, hinting that local buy-in has been mixed. “I wish more commonwealth’s attorneys would heed my call to listen to victims. Too many haven’t.”
When asked whether his office has done enough to address police misconduct, Miyares pointed to his 2023 settlement with the Town of Windsor, where officers had unlawfully stopped and threatened a Black Army lieutenant. 
“You can be pro-law enforcement and still demand accountability,” he said. “They’re the only ones with a monopoly on violence in our society — they should be held to a higher standard.”
He added that oversight takes time. “We want to be thorough and systematic. And yes, if any other department crosses that boundary, we’ll get involved.”
That approach hasn’t stopped critics from accusing Miyares of being too soft on departments that violate civil rights — an accusation he flatly rejects. “The facts don’t support that claim,” he said.
Still, Miyares makes clear that his office prioritizes public safety above political fashion. “I will not support a criminal-first, victim-last mindset,” he said. “We’ve heard a lot about reform, but rarely do you hear the word ‘victim’ in those debates. That ends with me.”
 Taking on corporations 

Miyares has also overseen a wave of settlements that he says bring real change to communities.
“We’ve secured over $1.3 billion from opioid manufacturers and distributors,” he said. Some of that money, he said, helped open a 75-bed inpatient treatment center in Galax — “the first of its kind within a 100-mile radius.”
He emphasized that the money is managed by Virginia’s Opioid Abatement Authority, not his office, to ensure transparency and local tailoring. “What works in Fairfax may not work in Galax. But this is the largest influx of treatment funding in state history.”
On environmental enforcement, Miyares points to an $80 million settlement with Monsanto over PCB pollution and multiple other actions, including prosecuting illegal landfills and forcing remediation of oil spills and raw sewage discharges. “Our environmental law section has been incredibly active,” he said. “We’re thorough, we’re relentless, and we’re the people’s protector.”
That populist posture extends to corporations. Miyares boasts of taking on utility giants and the Washington Commanders alike. “We got a bigger settlement from the Commanders than D.C. and Maryland combined,” he said, referring to the $1.3 million paid over unlawfully withheld ticket deposits.
And in 2023, his office negotiated changes to Dominion Energy’s offshore wind plan. “We got them to share $3 billion of the risk, instead of placing it all on the ratepayers,” he said. “Before us, Virginians were on the hook for 100% of that cost.”
But his critics say his record on housing and regulation is mixed. Miyares counters that protecting property rights doesn’t preclude enforcing civil rights.
“I don’t think those are mutually exclusive,” he said. “We secured the largest housing discrimination verdict in Virginia’s history — $750,000 to two families evicted because one member was Black. And we’re making sure bad actors are held accountable, without choking off affordable housing through overregulation.”
 Elections, energy and political calculations

Early into his tenure, Miyares  established an Election Integrity Unit, which he said ensures voter rolls are accurate. Launched in September 2022 with no new funding, the unit is tasked with investigating election-law violations and safeguarding voting integrity. It successfully issued a cease‑and‑desist against misleading mailers sent by Look Ahead America — an action upheld by a federal appeals court.
But its only notable prosecution —a  misdemeanor and felony case against former Prince William County registrar Michele White — collapsed after prosecutors dropped all charges due to inconsistent witness testimony. 
While Miyares touts the unit as crucial to preventing fraud, no actual voter fraud has been identified, leading watchdogs like the NAACP to criticize the unit as more reflective of political signaling than prosecutorial gain.
“I can cite several Virginia elections decided by a handful of votes. It should be easy to vote, hard to cheat,” he said, rejecting the notion that voter ID laws are a means of suppression. “I cannot get a library card without an ID. Voter ID is not controversial.”
In the interview, Miyares wouldn’t commit to refraining from prosecuting voters accidentally registered in error, noting that knowingly voting as a non-citizen could still result in legal action. “They’d have to fear prosecution if they go knowing they’re a non-citizen,” he said.
Miyares, along with Youngkin, has repeatedly challenged Virginia’s ties to California’s environmental standards, particularly on electric vehicles.
“Tying ourselves to California is a fool’s errand,” he said. “Their regulations are being dictated by an unelected air board. The average EV costs $68,000. That’s a tax on working-class Virginians.”
He said Virginia needs to expand its baseload energy capacity, not rely on intermittent sources like wind and solar. “I want electric bills to go down. Tying ourselves to California ensures they go up.”
Despite this skepticism, Miyares defended his record on climate enforcement, including recent court victories over solar and wind energy permits. “We are enforcing the law — just not surrendering to mandates that hurt working people.”
Miyares has also made “second chances” a talking point, holding job fairs for formerly incarcerated Virginians. But he remains skeptical of broader criminal justice reforms, including eliminating mandatory minimums.
“They’re an effective tool,” he said. “They help us go after repeat violent offenders and keep them off the streets.”
He argued that justice reform must be victim-centered. 
“Too many of these conversations leave out the victims entirely. They’ve been through trauma, they’ve testified under oath in a courtroom full of strangers, and they deserve to know the system protects them.”
When asked if he supports GOP lieutenant governor nominee John Reid, whose campaign was embroiled in scandal earlier this spring, Miyares replied simply, “I support Republicans.” Despite Youngkin’s attempts to nudge Reid from the race, Miyares said he respects the governor’s judgment — but “John Reid is our nominee.”
Looking to the 2025 election, Miyares said he’s proudest of the state’s drop in fentanyl death — 46%, more than double the national average. “There are Virginians alive today because of our work,” he said.
If reelected, he said, he’d expand Operation Ceasefire and continue pressing commonwealth’s attorneys to prioritize victims. 
“I have said before, I will not support a criminal first, victim last mindset. And I find it amazing that whenever we have these great discussions about criminal justice reform, the one word that you never hear is victims,” Miyares said. 
“Denying the voice of victims is not something I’ll ever find acceptable.”

(Courtesy of Virginia Department of Transportation).CHESTERFIELD, Va.—Virginia was one of several states in the Appalachian region slammed by Hurricane Helene’s rainfall last September. The storm caused the New River to crest at 31 feet a day after it battered the region. In one area of Damascus, homes were lifted up and washed away.
A separate storm besieged southwest Virginia in February, knocking out power to 203,000 homes and closing 270 roads. Last month, a 1.5-mile stretch of U.S. Route 58, a major thoroughfare in the road-constrained mountainous region, reopened after getting washed out.
Now, at the beginning of a 2025 hurricane season forecast to be “above average,” Virginia is in preparation mode for the season that typically picks up steam throughout summer and does its damage in the fall, like Helene did last year.
Scientists have continuously pointed to human-created emissions leading to atmospheric warming and rising oceans that contribute to hurricanes’ more intense rainfall. Jeff Orrock, meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service’s Wakefield office, said research indicates there have been more major hurricanes in the last 13 years than there had been in the half-century before that.

“What we consider normal is a higher number of storms than what we considered normal, say, 20 years ago,” Orrock said in an interview.
Against this backdrop of worsening disasters, the Trump administration is suggesting that states should shoulder significantly more of the burden of response and recovery. Layoffs and buyouts have cut a big swath through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and President Donald Trump has said he might want to eliminate FEMAentirely. His proposed budget for the fiscal year starting in October would cut $646 million from the agency.
In January, Trump ordered a newly established council to “assess” FEMA. Later, the administration fired the acting administrator of FEMA a day after he told a congressional subcommittee that he didn’t think eliminating the agency was “in the best interest of the American people.” His replacement reportedly said during a recent staff meeting that he didn’t know there was a hurricane season.
Virginia’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, is one of two sitting governors, alongside Texas’ Greg Abbott, on Trump’s council conducting the FEMA review. At a June 1 media event marking the start of hurricane season, Youngkin told Inside Climate News that “we’ll be doing the transformation design work” over a 180-day span. That, he said, will make “FEMA more effective and more efficient and more responsive to state needs.”
“Meanwhile, FEMA’s ready to go to support anybody during hurricane season that needs it,” said Youngkin, a Trump ally.
On the other side of the political aisle, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said he’s worried about the implications for his state if federal involvement in disaster response and recovery shrivels. When the losses communities suffer are too big to handle on their own, states need federal help, he said.
“Think about western North Carolina that got devastated,” he said. “I believe the costs were in the roughly $60 to $80 billion [range]. That would bankrupt the state if you had to do it all on your own. … All you’re doing is passing the buck.”
He added: “Frankly, for states like ours that can get hit both by hurricanes with our shoreline as well as this increasing number of storms that come up, for example into Southwest Virginia, we would bear a disproportionate burden. It wouldn’t be fair, it wouldn’t be right.”
What disaster recovery might look like in a post-FEMA world isn’t clear. Among the Republican proposals is to instead send federal block grants to states based in part on historical disaster frequency. But FEMA does a lot that states would find challenging or impossible to replicate, from flood insurance to training and multi-agency coordination. Youngkin acknowledged at his media event that such coordination happens on a “deep” level with local, state and federal agencies.

The changes Warner would like to see from FEMA include faster resource deployment and more equitable assistance to help climate-vulnerable states like Virginia.
Warner pointed to the agency’s individual assistance program, which provides disaster relief funding to people whose property has been damaged in a storm. But in the case of some Southwest Virginia communities, the program has provided no assistance. In a region where nearly 18 percent of people live below the federal poverty level, he said, “you can have a hundred houses destroyed in Hurley and Buchanan County that wouldn’t have the same property value as 20 houses in Fairfax County.”
Because of the lower property values in those southwestern communities, the damage costs didn’t meet FEMA thresholds, which Warner said should be adjusted.
“That’s unfair,” Warner said.
Neither the White House nor FEMA responded to requests for comment about concerns over the federal government’s role in disaster response.
 The impact of cuts to the National Weather Service

FEMA isn’t the only agency important to disaster response that’s sustaining cuts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has faced major workforce reductions in recent months, and Trump has proposed cutting $1.5 billion from its budget starting in October, about a quarter of its current spending.
Within NOAA, the National Weather Service is down about 600 employees—the agency is looking to hire again after warnings that the cuts could endanger lives. Many of its 122 local forecasting offices are operating with reduced personnel.

When Inside Climate News asked the five offices in Virginia for their current staffing levels, each referred questions to a spokesperson for the National Weather Service, who did not answer the question. Instead, the agency sent a statement that it “continues to conduct short-term Temporary Duty assignments (TDYs), and is in the process of conducting a series of Reassignment Opportunity Notices (RONs) to fill roles at NWS field locations with the greatest operational need.
“Additionally, a targeted number of permanent, mission-critical field positions will soon be advertised under an exception to the Department-wide hiring freeze to further stabilize frontline operations,” the statement read.
Orrock said his Wakefield office was able to maintain its forecasters and technicians to monitor storms and communicate with other offices, including sending out weather warnings.
It’s important to watch for a “swinging door” weather pattern, he said. Winds from across the mid-Atlantic shut that figurative door, pushing storms into the Chesapeake Bay. But with “a nice southerly flow” the “door swings open,” causing a weather pattern to stay for weeks or months, Orrock said.
“If you get a hurricane anywhere from the Bahamas and East, and that door’s open, she’s coming up here,” Orrock said. “It’s just a matter of if it’s going to re-curve or is it going to come on in.”
 Existing planning at the state level for disaster relief

A key to mitigating flood damage, environmental advocates say, is ensuring flood protections through planning and nature-based solutions to absorb water accumulations and storm surges.
Virginia provides funds to its Community Flood Preparedness Fund for that planning. But Youngkin in December 2023 withdrew the state from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the main source of those funds via payments made by power plant owners. Of the $830 million Virginia received, state law directed 45 percent toward the flood fund, 50 percent for energy efficiency efforts and the rest for administrative costs.
Lawmakers have clashed over how to sustain continued funding for flood mitigation without RGGI revenues while also providing disaster relief.
Youngkin in December 2023 put $100 million in general funds toward the flood fund and this year added $50 million in non-general funds, said Peter Finocchio, press secretary, who did not clarify if the second funding stream came from the final RGGI revenue that hadn’t yet been divvied up. Another $100 million in general funds went to a Resilient Virginia Revolving Loan Fund, a separate flood mitigation program.
For disaster relief, lawmakers this year ultimately put $50 million from the general fund toward what became the Virginia Disaster Assistance Fund for Helene and February storm victims, with half for relief and half for making communities more resilient.

Trump, meanwhile, made cuts to FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program, which helped communities bolster their ability to deal with flooding. The Environmental Defense Fund, in an email to Inside Climate News, said Trump’s cuts result in a loss of about $69 million for 39 projects that “may weaken Virginia’s safety, preparedness and economy.”
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also canceled a $20 million grant intended to provide flood mitigation for Aberdeen Gardens, a historically Black neighborhood in the Hampton Roads region.
The funding came through the Inflation Reduction Act’s Community Change Grants Program. Several groups are challenging Trump’s cancellation of IRA grants that were appropriated through Congress. Norfolk-based Wetlands Watch, the beneficiary of this grant alongside the city of Hampton, said in a news release that the two “are exploring all options to appeal the surprise termination.”
“This is not just about one grant,” said Mary-Carson Stiff, executive director of Wetlands Watch. “It’s about the principle that public commitments made to protect vulnerable communities cannot be violated according to political caprice. We intend to fight—and we are calling on our supporters and the public to stand with us.”

Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) was a special guest speaker at the 2025 Maryland Democratic Party Gala on Thursday. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).It was a celebration of Maryland Democrats and their victories over the past year, but the specter of President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress was never far off.
With fancy gowns, sharp suits and drinks in hand, several hundred Maryland Democratic politicians, advocates and donors gathered Thursday at Martin’s West and tried to find the light in their uphill battle against the Trump White House and the  Republican majority in Congress.
But in three hours of speeches, nearly every speaker stressed that the fight against Trump’s administration needs to continue — even if the challenges seem insurmountable. That included the evening’s keynote speaker, Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), a one-time pastor at Douglas Memorial Community Church in Baltimore.
“We will not give in to those who are trying to weaponize fear and despair,” Warnock told the crowd. “We will not be intimidated into silence. We must raise our voices now more than ever.
“We are not going to give in to the rhetoric … of those who are trying to divide us. People who have no vision,” he said. “They don’t know how to lead us, so they are trying to divide us.”
During the evening, Democratic leaders aired a wide range of grievances against the Trump administration’s actions over the last five months — from mass layoffs of federal workers to the “erroneous” deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to massive proposed budget cuts for programs such as Medicaid.
While much of the evening served as a rallying cry to push back against Republicans in Congress, the evening also functioned as a farewell event to the outgoing Maryland Democratic Party Chair Ken Ulman, who will officially resign from the position Friday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ulman said he was proud of what was accomplished in the time since he took over as chair in 2023.
“We’ve been busy the last couple of years. What did we do? In 2024, we won some elections. We won some big elections,” Ulman said. “We kept our margin in the federal delegation. Angela Alsobrooks beat Larry Hogan – it took 10 years, we got him.”
He was referring to the election of U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D) against former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R).
Ulman also recognized  wins by Democratic freshman Reps. Johnny Olszewski Jr. (2nd), Sarah Elfreth (3rd) and April McClain Delaney (6th), and he celebrated the party’s hand in staving off several school board candidates — normally nonpartisan elections — who were politically aligned with the conservative group Moms for Liberty.
But always it came back to the Trump administration. Democrats promised to fight back against what Alsobrooks called “a horrible time” in America.
“We must understand in this moment that we have to fight back with everything within us, because we are not only harming ourselves here at home, but our image across the world is at stake,” Alsobrooks told the gala. “What a horrible time it is for our country.”
Many of their comments centered around the budget reconciliation bill known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which aims to reduce federal spending by drastically cutting funds to programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps.

In a live recording of the Maryland Democratic Party’s new podcast, called “Burn the Talking Points,” Maryland’s freshman House members were asked to describe the Big Beautiful Bill in one word.
Olszewski said the bill was “ugly,” Elfreth called the legislation “an abomination,” while McClain Delaney simply called it “mean.”
Also speaking Thursday were Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th), as well as Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, and Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) ended the evening with his usual bright message of encouragement for the years ahead under the Trump administration.
“As Sen. Warnock said, these are challenging times. No one can deny it,” he said, adding that he hoped to see Maryland take charge in pushing back against Trump and the Republicans.
“There is something that no one can deny. Maryland is showing that we can do different. That inside this moment, we have to be able to call out injustices,” Moore said. “And we have to be able to call out the atrocities that we are seeing from this administration.
“But we also have to be very clear that calling out the atrocities will not be enough — we have to show what an alternative can actually be,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_demgala_warnock-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-13 05:57:16.020908

Wes Moore (D), in Annapolis Thursday, touts a $19 million donation from Exelon to help low- and middle-income ratepayers hit by steadily rising power bills. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)The parent company of BGE, Pepco and Delmarva Power will distribute $19 million to help its low- and middle-income customers pay their bills, as rates continue to rise, it announced Thursday.
Exelon’s one-time donation to its Customer Relief Fund will be split between local nonprofits to actually distribute to customers in need. It’s part of a larger $50 million Exelon donation spread out between states the company serves.
During an event Thursday at the Salvation Army of Annapolis, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) cheered the Exelon program and added that he hopes to take future steps regarding climbing energy costs.
“This is not a final step, but it’s an important continuation of the work that we are doing to provide relief to Marylanders who need it the most,” Moore said. “Maryland is ready to lead the country in what it means to put our people first.”
Consumer advocates welcomed the announcement, but put it in perspective.
“It’s welcome news that the Exelon Corp. is donating $19 million to direct relief for Maryland ratepayers. But let’s not forget that Exelon and its subsidiaries have been driving affordability problems in the first place through relentless rate hikes,” said Emily Scarr, a senior advisor for the nonprofit Maryland PIRG, which advocates for ratepayers.
She argued that Exelon’s rate hikes, outpacing inflation, have led to “massive profits and unaffordable home heating and cooling.”
In a news release announcing the program, Exelon President and CEO Calvin Butler blamed the high energy bills on “increased supply costs.”

“The Customer Relief Fund, in addition to our existing year-round programs supporting customers with energy assistance, once again demonstrates Exelon’s commitment to our communities,” Butler’s statement said. “We continue to work with federal, state and local officials to develop long-term solutions that ensure customers affordable, reliable and sustainable energy.”
The moves come as Maryland ratepayers brace for the latest blow to their monthly utility bills.
In the coming months, customers will feel the effects of a record-setting energy capacity auction at PJM Interconnection, which operates the electricity grid serving Maryland, Washington D.C. and a dozen other states.
As a result of the auction, in the year beginning June 1, utilities and retail suppliers of energy will pay $14.7 billion for electric capacity, a jump from the $2.2 billion the previous year — which will flow down to consumers.
Some are blaming PJM for botching the auction by failing to accurately evaluate the amount of power already available, driging up costs. They also say its policies have constrained supply at a time of increasing demand, by preventing renewable energy from coming online quickly.
Moore, standing beside BGE and Pepco officials during his remarks, zeroed in on PJM.
“It is unacceptable that inefficient and outdated processes at PJM are leading to bill increases — not just in Maryland, but across all 13 states and D.C.,” he said.
But ratepayer advocates argue that utility companies, including Exelon, have contributed to the energy affordability crisis as well, in part because of overzealous infrastructure spending.

They point to the “distribution” charges on electric bills, which fund substations, poles, wires, trucks and other equipment for their local utility. Between 2010 and 2024, the distribution rates for Exelon utilities Delmarva Power and Pepco more than doubled, well outpacing the rate of inflation; by comparison, Potomac Edison rates increased with inflation, according to a June report from the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel.
Whatever the cause, prices keep rising, and customers keep falling farther behind: At BGE, for example, residential customers were recently  $171 million in arrears, compared to $97 million just last June.
At Thursday’s event in Annapolis, BGE CEO Tamla Olivier said that addressing the high energy burden in Maryland will require participation from a number of stakeholders.
“We’re not going to be able to solve this as a utility, the state alone or competitive markets alone. It will take all of us together to make sure we are serving the needs of our customers,” Olivier said.
United Way of Central Maryland will administer $15 million of Exelon’s Customer Relief Fund for BGE customers, and the Salvation Army will administer $2.5 million for Pepco customers. Delmarva Power customers will receive $1.5 million, distributed by the Harford Community Action Agency, Shore UP! and the Salvation Army.
Eligibility requirements and distribution methods will differ from utility to utility, said Exelon’s news release, which encouraged customers to visit their local utility’s website for more details. It said eligible customers “may see as much as several hundred dollars in relief.”
Franklyn Baker, president and CEO of the United Way of Central Maryland, said energy bills have been a frequent source of calls to its 211 hotline for assistance with food, health care, rent or mortgage, utility or other bills, and child care.
“We continue to see a rise in the number of calls to 211 related to energy assistance,” Baker said. “And especially as summer heat intensifies everyday costs rise, and the cost of utilities will be a burden that many in our community will not be able to carry, including some — listen to this — who have never applied for assistance before.”

Maryland electric customers can expect to pay anywhere from $4 to $18 a month, according to the Office of People’s Counsel report. It said SMECO customers will see increases starting June 1, while Pepco and Delmarva Power customers will see bills go up in August and  Potomac Edison customers will get hit in their October bills.
The Exelon fund is not the only effort to shave costs for customers. The Maryland Public Service Commission recently ordered BGE to spread its costs increases over several months to blunt the impact
And state lawmakers in the last legislative session tapped a renewable energy fund for $200 million, which will be used top give credit directly to ratepayers. The one-time payments are expected to average $80, split between a bill in the summer and another in the winter.
The rebate was part of a larger package of energy reforms, which also created a “fast-track” permit process at the PSC for new power generation and battery energy storage technology.
Moore, who who signed the bill in May, said that the newly announced $19 million “goes hand in hand” with the legislature’s rebate.
But in response to a question from a reporter, Moore said that lawmakers “didn’t go far enough” to incentivize new power generation, noting that a bill that his administration introduced, to boost nuclear power in the state, did not advance.
“We introduced legislation this year that would have allowed more nuclear into the state, that would have allowed nuclear to be seen as a clean energy source, which it is,” Moore said. “I’m proud of the work we did in partnership with the legislature, but I want to be crystal clear: It did not go far enough.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HEADSHOT-120-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-13 05:57:16.020908

At last some of those costs are being passed on to customers, the report said.
The news comes as recent polls show that voters strongly disapprove of the way President Donald Trump, the author of huge new tariffs, is handling the economy.


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


The Cleveland Fed represents the Federal Reserve System’s Fourth District — a region that covers all of Ohio and parts of Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia. Eight times a year, it conducts interviews and online questionnaires with businesses, community organizations, economists and other sources. 
The Beige Book report released last week said those sources “continued to suggest flat business activity in the Fourth District in recent weeks, and they expected activity to remain flat in the months ahead. Retailers noted a pullback in consumer spending, and manufacturers said that ongoing economic and trade policy uncertainty continued to dampen demand for their goods. Demand for professional and business services increased driven by higher demand for consultations amid the shifting regulatory environment.”
A tariff is a tax on imports that is sometimes imposed to foster domestic industry. Sometimes they’re imposed in retaliation against perceived unfair practices by trading partners, such as China.
Since taking office, Trump has announced a bewildering array of on-again, off-again tariffs, including 50% ones on steel and aluminum that took effect last week.
The Consumer Price Index grew at a relatively moderate 2.4% in May, but the New York Times pointed out that it reflects only the initial impacts of the tariffs. While many of Trump’s tariffs have been delayed or are just beginning to take effect, the Cleveland Fed report said their effects are being felt.
“On balance, contacts indicated that nonlabor input costs rose at a robust pace in recent weeks, continuing an upward trend that began after a period of stability in 2024,” it said. “Contacts from multiple sectors noted that tariffs were now increasing the costs of materials that they import. Some contacts also noted secondary impacts of tariff-related cost increases from domestic producers. For example, one manufacturer said that their U.S.-based raw materials suppliers raised prices to factor in the overtime needed to meet increased domestic demand.”
It added that its sources of food and hospitality information voiced relief over dropping egg prices. But they “generally expected costs to grow at a strong pace in the coming months.”
More of the fed’s sources said they increased prices than did in the previous reporting period. Some blamed tariffs.
“Contacts across industries, particularly those in manufacturing and construction, said that they raised prices to cover costs related to tariffs and to elevated prices of materials such as steel,” the report said. “Auto dealers generally mentioned raising prices of new and used vehicles, and one said that they were offering less discounting because of higher demand.”
Some of that demand, the report said, was from consumers trying to buy vehicles now because they anticipate higher prices in the future.
The news comes as Ohio has the nation’s sixth-highest unemployment, consumer confidence remains relatively low, and Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy. 
A Quinippiac University poll released on Tuesday said that respondents disapproved of him on the economy by a 16-point margin. The president had an overall approval rating of 38%.

Measles outbreaks starting in May have grown to 34 cases in North Dakota, giving the state the highest rate in the country, followed by New Mexico and Texas. (Photo courtesy of Visit Fargo-Moorhead)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”











Now they’ve seen measles in their community so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’


– Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas



In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
Outbreak moves north
In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”

Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
As measles outbreaks grow, Trump cuts hinder vaccination efforts

It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas
According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 6, there are 1,168 confirmed cases affecting 33 states. Texas reported two more cases June 10, and Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
Some measles response plans crash to a halt after Trump cuts

There have been 17 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, stands in the background. (Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)The Ohio Senate-approved budget keeps eligibility for state-supported child care at levels that state leaders and advocates say is one of the worst in the country, and eliminates a cost-sharing model for child care that was supported by Republicans in both chambers.
Eligibility for Publicly Funded Child Care wasn’t increased in the Ohio Senate proposal as advocates had urged, maintaining the state eligibility of 145% of the federal poverty level.
That level leaves Ohio at what Ohio Department of Children and Youth Director Kara Wente, along with advocates like Policy Matters Ohio, said was one of the lowest eligibility levels in the country.
To even get to the middle of rankings on child care eligibility, Heather Smith, a researcher with Policy Matters Ohio, said the state would need to jump their eligibility level to 225%, far above what advocates requested, which was an increase to 160%.
One thing that made it to the Senate proposal at the urging of advocates was a provision that calculates payments for Publicly Funded Child Care based on enrollment numbers rather than attendance. Child care workers and leaders said the method would create more consistency in payments and would be “critical” for parents and providers.
The budget eliminates a Republican-supported measure added in the House version called the Child Care Cred Program, which would create a cost-sharing model for child care, in which employers, eligible employees, and the state all pay a portion of the cost of child care. In the most recent discussions on the model, the state would pay 20%, and employers and employees would put in 40% each.
The measure came from bills in both chambers of the Ohio legislature, the GOP sponsors of which pushed the model as a way to address a state child care sector that has long been considered inaccessible, unaffordable, and without the adequate (and adequately paid) workforce to stand up to the demand.
Policy Matters actually supported taking the model out of the budget, citing “lackluster results” from comparable programs in other states.
Smith said the funding “would have a greater impact” if it was directed toward Ohio Senate Bill 177, a GOP-led bill that would create a pilot program to allow child care staff members to have Publicly Funded Child Care for free.
“This program would stabilize the sector while creating an additional 6,000 to 18,000 spots in child care facilities,” according to Smith.

The Child Care Choice Voucher program, which Republican Gov. Mike DeWine praised as an important part of the state’s support for parents and the child care sector, stayed in the Senate-passed budget with eligibility at 200% of the federal poverty line to receive subsidies for child care services.
But the budget took out language regarding Step Up to Quality, a set of state standards for licensed child care providers, and Smith said the payment rates for the voucher program “are not sufficient for providers.”
The voucher program would receive $25 million less over the next two years than was proposed in DeWine’s executive budget. While he asked for $75 million in 2026 and $150 million in 2027, the Senate kept the House’s amounts, at $100 million in each fiscal year.
Early childhood education advocacy group Groundwork Ohio said the Senate proposal “fails to meet the moment.”
“Ohio families are doing everything right,” said Lynanne Gutierrez, president and CEO of Groundwork Ohio, in testimony to the Senate Finance Committee before the proposal was passed. “They’re working hard, raising kids and keeping our economy moving. They deserve a budget that recognizes their contribution and meets them with the support they need.”
Gutierrez and Groundwork pushed for restoration of the Child Tax Credit as well, which would have provided up to $1,000 per child ages 0 to 6. The credit had the support of state organizations and individuals, along with economic experts who said the credit would boost the state’s financial health.
Republican legislative leaders pushed back on the tax credit, partly because the money for the credit would have come from tobacco taxes, which legislative leaders said was a fading source of revenue.
A Child Care Recruitment and Mentorship Grant Program was kept from the House provision, to “help increase the number of licensed child care providers in Ohio and to assist recited entities and individuals.”
The budget proposal includes $1.75 million in fiscal year 2026 and $1 million in 2027 for the program.
Another grant program that survived to the Senate budget was the Early Childhood Education Grant Program, to “support and invest in Ohio’s early learning and development programs,” including licensed child care centers, licensed family child care homes and licensed preschools.
The Ohio House and Ohio Senate are now working in closed-door discussions to combine their two versions into a final budget draft, set to be sent to the governor for signature, and possible line-item vetoes, by July 1.

Here, House members meet during a session in March. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)As New Hampshire’s 2025 legislative session nears its end, state lawmakers are working to get some of the remaining pieces of legislation across the finish line — or kill them entirely.
The New Hampshire House and Senate convened Thursday to review the bills, which required another vote because they were amended later in the legislative process. These are bills that one chamber approved before the other chamber added an amendment and passed a different version. Now, the chamber where the bill originated must review those amendments to decide whether they agree.
Lawmakers had three options. They could accepted the amendment, advancing the bill to Gov. Kelly Ayotte; kill the bill outright, if they disliked the amendment; or aim to hash out their differences by creating a committee of conference, which includes lawmakers from both chambers.
Here’s a look at some of those votes.
Bills that were accepted
In many cases, the chambers simply agreed with the new amendments and decided to approve the bill. These bills will now be reviewed by Ayotte, who will have the option of signing them into law or vetoing them. She could also let them become law without her signature. Here are some of the noteworthy bills from Thursday headed to the governor’s desk:
AI child pornography: The Senate approved Senate Bill 300 in March, which makes it a felony to create child pornography — or any “intimate visual representation” of a “child’s intimate parts” — using artificial intelligence or any other technology. It is already illegal to create child pornography using a camera. The House amended the bill to specify that, for it to be a felony, the perpetrator must be creating it “for the purpose of sexual gratification or sexual arousal.” The Senate agreed Thursday.
Drones and high speeds: House Bill 468 originally sought to make it illegal to use a drone in a manner that interferes with law enforcement, emergency response, or human-occupied airplanes or airports. The bill would also make it illegal for civilians to equip drones with weapons or fly them into restricted airspaces. The House approved the bill in February, but the Senate subsequently added an amendment that would make punishments for speeding more severe if the perpetrator drives over 100 mph. The bill would require fines of at least $750 on the first offense and $1,000 for subsequent offenses, and it would temporarily revoke the perpetrator’s license.
Local tax caps: The House approved House Bill 200 in March, legislation that makes it harder to override a local tax cap. Currently, if voters want to impose a tax cap on their local elected officials — forbidding them from raising taxes above a certain point — they must have a 60% supermajority of votes in favor of the tax cap. If they want to override the tax cap and allow their elected officials to raise taxes above the established threshold, they need only a simple majority. This bill seeks to change that and require a supermajority to override the tax cap as well. When the Senate’s turn to consider the bill came, it amended the bill to remove a provision forbidding tax cap override votes from being put on the same ballot used to elect local officials. The House concurred Thursday.
Crime reports: House Bill 218 seeks to require police to provide crime reports to the victim for free within 7 days if requested. The House approved it in March. The Senate amended the bill to specify the procedures for how the police should inform victims of their rights to receive crime reports. The House agreed with that amendment Thursday.
Bills that were thrown out over differences
Both chambers outright rejected several bills over their new amendments and decided against a committee of conference. Here are some of them:
Medicaid … and ivermectin: Senate Bill 119 was originally proposed as a Medicaid efficiency program. The bill would’ve allowed Medicaid to purchase name-brand drugs when they are cheaper than generics, something it has long been prohibited from doing because historically name brands are more expensive. Recent market developments have resulted in some name-brand drugs being cheaper than their generic counterparts, so lawmakers introduced SB 119 to change that and save the state money. The Senate approved it in March. However, when the House took up the bill, a group of Republicans added a provision that would turn ivermectin — the antiparasitic drug that gained notoriety when it was erroneously touted as an effective COVID-19 treatment — into an over-the-counter drug that doesn’t require a doctor’s prescription. The Senate killed the amended bill Thursday.
Horse racing … and vaccines: Senate Bill 60 was introduced to make online horse betting legal. Horse racing is already legal in New Hampshire, but lawmakers in support of this bill said the laws needed to be modernized to account for new digital advancements in gambling and to allow the state lottery commission to properly regulate it. The bill also would’ve allowed gamblers to deposit money into accounts before they place a bet, rather than paying each individual bet. However, when the House approved it, they added unrelated provisions that would take away the state health commissioner’s ability to require that children receive certain vaccines. These provisions were taken from a different bill, House Bill 357, that was approved by the House but rejected by the Senate. The Senate rejected this Thursday.
Migrant driver’s licenses: The Senate rejected the House’s amended version of Senate Bill 13 Thursday. The bill would’ve made out-of-state driver’s licenses issued to immigrants who lack proper documentation invalid in New Hampshire. The Senate approved it in January, but when the House considered it months later, lawmakers added a provision that would’ve barred state employees from renewing driver’s licenses for people with pending asylum claims, regardless of whether they have a previous or current work authorization in the country. The Senate voted this down Thursday and killed the bill.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/housevoteabortion-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-13 05:57:16.020908
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-13 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT farmers await disaster relief amid clash between Dems, USDA",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/13/ct-farmer-crop-loss-disaster-federal-aid/,CT will operate its own block grant. But lawmakers argued the options from USDA could prevent some farmers from getting needed relief.,"It has been nearly a year since heavy rainfall left Kaitlyn Kimball’s 3-acre field in Naugatuck under a foot of water for almost a week, killing all of the tomatoes. 
But Kimball, who co-owns Sunset Farm, said she can “still feel the impact” of the flooding from August 2024. Kimball said she lost years of compost and materials to improve the soil, and she had to buy extra fertilizer.
That same rain also hit David Buck’s Guardians Farm in Southbury. He had just gotten his license from the state agriculture agency, and the flooding coincided with the day he was finally getting to sell milk. And he recalled the consistent rain in 2023 adding an extra layer of challenges as he built up dairy operations.
As farmers like Kimball and Buck await relief for weather-related losses, Connecticut officials and its federal counterparts have been working for months on a $220 million block grant for small and midsize farming states. Over the past couple of weeks, negotiations hit a new juncture, prompting some disagreements over the rollout of disaster aid passed by Congress in December.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture presented two options. States could run their own crop loss program by using the block grant tailored for them, but they wouldn’t get access to a larger pot of supplemental disaster aid — the option that Connecticut ultimately chose. Or they could go with the latter, run by the federal agency, but face limits on what gets covered by the block grant.
Connecticut decided it would develop a state-run program using the federal block grant to help farmers recoup losses from extreme weather in 2023 and 2024. Under the current structure, that means the state won’t get access to the $21 billion Supplemental Disaster Relief Program, or SDRP.
After learning of the USDA’s proposals in late May, eligible states scrambled to make an assessment and meet the initial deadline of June 4, though Connecticut got an extension until this past Wednesday. States weighed which option made more sense for their farmers while they wait to learn how much of the $220 million grant they will receive.
Connecticut’s Department of Agriculture believes the block grant option gives the state more flexibility for specialty crop operations, especially since the supplemental disaster funds might not cover many of the farmers and producers in Connecticut.

It’s a decision some farmers in Connecticut think is the best approach and one they are cautiously optimistic about since they have been waiting for relief for months. “It really seems like the only option you can do. It feels like a no-brainer,” Buck said.
But the state agency and Connecticut’s congressional delegation pushed back against the USDA’s parameters that states cannot participate in both programs.
“While we respectfully disagree with USDA’s interpretation that states must choose exclusively between the two options, we have proceeded with Option 1 to avoid leaving producers without critical recovery assistance,” the state Department of Agriculture wrote in its newsletter last Friday. “We also reserve the right to challenge USDA’s statutory interpretation that precludes dual participation in both the SDRP and Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant and have requested clarification on this point.”
The Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant Program was set up to go to farmers and producers in New England plus Hawaii and Alaska — smaller farming states that don’t typically benefit from federal programs as much as commodity farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere. The grant included crop, timber and livestock losses caused by extreme weather in 2023 and 2024 and didn’t require crop insurance to qualify.
Connecticut’s Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt and his office have been talking with USDA staff on a weekly basis to finalize the contract and formally set up the block grant agreement. Both parties remain in contact about the path forward.
As things stand, Connecticut is waiting to hear back on its allocation of the $220 million. It’s also waiting for USDA’s approval of the state’s design of the program.
The USDA is trying to stay on track with its timeline to roll out various disaster funding streams. Under this plan, agreements for the small states block grant could be executed by June 30 if finalized by Friday.
From there, it’s expected states will manage the program and determine the schedule for applications and disbursements. But the timing of that is still up in the air until the contract is squared. Some farmers in the state don’t expect payments until months from now.
USDA, CT lawmakers clash over disaster aid 
The USDA’s proposals set off a back-and-forth between the federal agency and Democratic lawmakers over the deployment of disaster aid. The farm assistance passed on Dec. 20 as part of a broader supplemental package to help those suffering from recent natural disasters and extreme weather.
Questions emerged over the potential of double dipping and farmers getting money to cover the same thing. (Lawmakers said there is an audit in place to prevent that and ensure farmers aren’t exceeding their losses.)
Lawmakers argued that the options as designed could prevent some farmers in New England and smaller Pacific states from getting the relief they need. The USDA pushed back that Democrats are politicizing the issue and slow-walking aid for their own states.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, who championed the creation of the small state block grants, argued the federal agency is going against the intentions of Congress in how it wrote and passed the law. She said lawmakers interpreted the $220 million as a supplement for smaller farmers who don’t always qualify for traditional disaster relief.
A group of 29 Democratic lawmakers who represent the eligible block-grant states framed it as an “bait and switch” that pits two federal disaster aid programs against each other. They argued it could hurt small and midsize farmers, many of whom do not have crop insurance.
“USDA is demanding States either accept traditional disaster relief, which has failed most of our small farmers for years, or gamble on an unknown amount of repayment with little to no guidance from USDA. Once again, this choice would leave so many small farms to fend for themselves after a disaster,” the group of lawmakers said in a statement that included Connecticut’s House delegation and its two U.S. senators.
Critics wished farmers were part of the equation to solicit their feedback on USDA’s proposals instead of only asking state commissioners to decide quickly on the way to distribute disaster aid.
In her own statement, DeLauro called it an “unacceptable and a clear violation of the law as written.”

For its part, USDA is placing the blame on Democratic lawmakers, contending that they are delaying aid. The federal agency argued members are looking “to manufacture controversy and blame the Trump Administration” and accused them of trying to “misuse” taxpayer money.
“Secretary Rollins is working in good faith to deliver relief quickly and responsibly. USDA has met weekly with eligible states, offering flexible options and clear guidance to avoid duplicating existing federal programs,” USDA spokesman Seth W. Christensen said in a recent statement.
“Some states, led by partisan officials, have refused to engage,” he added. “They’re not just denying aid to their own farmers — they’re now delaying relief for producers nationwide.”
Disaster aid for farmers was a major topic of discussion when Rollins testified before two congressional committees last month. She vowed to get the money out but cautioned that the need from all eligible states will likely exceed what Congress appropriated for the small state block grants.
And the topic came up again a couple of times Wednesday while Rollins testified before the House Agriculture Committee.
During her questioning about the block grant and the Connecticut farms in need, U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, specifically highlighted Buck’s Guardians Farm, which is the only veteran-owned dairy farm in the state. Rollins wrote down the name of the farm, saying she wanted to get more information about it.
Hayes asked the agriculture secretary for the reasoning behind asking states to essentially choose between two disaster programs.
Rollins highlighted the active conversations that continue among state agriculture commissioners on the issue, including a call later with DeLauro.
“We are continuing to assess what this means, understanding that this $220 million block grant to New England that you all put in the relief act at the end of this year is different,” Rollins testified Wednesday. “We are continuing to look at this. The decision has not been released yet, but will be soon.”
While officials had until the end of Wednesday to make its final decision, Connecticut confirmed it will proceed with the block grant option.
In ongoing discussions over the matter, Rollins and DeLauro spoke on Wednesday.
Long-awaited aid
2024 wasn’t the only challenging year for farmers in Connecticut when it came to bad weather.
Buck of Guardians Farm recalled feeling like there was “constant rain all summer long for us” in 2023. And earlier that year, farmers also contended with a late-spring frost that affected some crops, like peaches.
Farmers who experienced weather-related losses in 2023 and 2024, including Kimball and Buck, filled out the survey to help Connecticut figure out how much to report to USDA to help determine state allocations. Kimball said she reported upwards of $30,000 in losses.
Connecticut’s Department of Agriculture submitted a request of $83 million to USDA in January. That included $72 million in reported losses, a 2% administration fee and $10 million for resiliency projects.
Kimball said she got an email from the commissioner about choosing the block grant the other day because she was working with a group to advocate for it. In addition to running Sunset Farm and overseeing farmers markets in New Haven, she is the director of agriculture for the nonprofit CitySeed, where she works on policy.
Since Connecticut is going with the block grant, it will be fully in charge of administering the program and eventual compensation. Some farmers feel like that will be more beneficial than going through USDA’s Farm Service Agency since the state agency has “more intimate knowledge” of farmers’ struggles from the past two years.
“I’m really excited about these block grants. This would be huge for our farm. I’m a little nervous about it actually going through,” Kimball said. “I’m glad to see that the state is moving forward in wanting to support farmers.”
Farmers have “experienced so much disruption to federal money in the last six months,” Kimball said. “I know the commissioner and other people at the Department of Ag pretty well, and I’d like to think that I trust their judgment in advocating for us.”

Buck was also active in trying to figure out what aid was available for farmers in Connecticut that got hit badly by flooding and other weather events. He was part of a number of meetings with nonprofits and at the state level. And he had encouraged other farmers and producers to respond to the survey of reported losses.
Given the quick turnaround, Buck said Connecticut needed to take a bit of a gamble on which option to choose. But he ultimately felt it “went the safer route.”
Buck said he isn’t too worried about the state not getting access to the supplemental disaster aid passed by Congress. From his perspective, Connecticut farmers could have been left out even more from the larger pot of money and then the state wouldn’t be able to use the block grant to its fullest capacity.
Because diversified farms in Connecticut get left out of federal agriculture assistance often, farmers in the area believe there needs to be more disaster relief at the state level, pointing to places like Massachusetts that got checks out the door within weeks after flooding hit the state.
“But I guess I’m very jaded when it comes to grants, just because, one, I don’t like relying on the government for things, but obviously we all need help at times,” said Buck, who noted he hasn’t gotten most of the grants he’s applied for over the years. At Wednesday’s hearing, Hayes noted that the farm has not received any disaster assistance, including a request for $50,000 to help recover some of the lost revenue.
Kimball gave credit to William “Willie” Dellacamera, a farmer from Northford, who had also been pushing for the rollout of farm disaster aid and the special block grant for New England.

He lost hundreds of thousands of dollars last August when a 13-minute hail storm destroyed his farm. That prompted him to travel to D.C. by tractor to push for help, for smaller farms that typically don’t get as much federal aid as larger commodity farms.
Since then, Dellacamera has made repeat trips to D.C. this year to get more answers on the block grant that was in part inspired by his story.
He came for several days in May to watch the hearings with Rollins in person. That trip got him face time with the agriculture secretary on two occasions as he made his plea for the quick rollout of the money for small and midsize farmers.
Dellacamera made a return trip this week to Congress amid the negotiations on the block grant. He again sat in the audience listening to Rollins testify before the House Agriculture Committee.
The next steps and the timing are a bit uncertain. And some farmers don’t anticipate getting anything until fall at the earliest.
“Whenever this goes through, obviously it’s taken too long. I was hoping again, in all these meetings I was going to last year, that something would have happened sooner to help farmers really get ready for the next year. We’re already in June now and we probably won’t see anything until the fall I’m assuming,” Buck said. “Nothing is going to happen quickly when you have the federal and the state government working together.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_1813.jpg,,,2025-06-13 05:57:16.020908

The bill makes dramatic changes to the food stamps program, known as SNAP, placing a substantial new burden on states. It comes at a moment when food banks and pantries say they’re stretched to the breaking point.
“We’re the richest nation on earth,” Grace Church pastor and Mid-Ohio Food Collective Board Member Michael Young said Thursday.
“This issue of feeding people should not be this difficult or this hard,” he continued, “(There) should not be many decisions to make when we’re talking about putting food on people’s table — it is a moral obligation.”

The program and the changes
The congressional Republican spending plan — President Trump’s “big beautiful bill” — would make significant changes to how we pay for the country’s primary food assistance program.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program has always been fully funded by the federal government, with states pitching in to cover half of administrative costs.
Ohio participants received $3.55 billion in benefits during the 2023 federal fiscal year. Now, Republicans in Congress want to shift some of that cost to states for the first time in the program’s history.
In the U.S. House, lawmakers proposed states pick up 15%-25% of the total. The U.S. Senate walked that back, but still wants many states to pitch in, tying it to how accurately a state determines eligibility and benefit amounts, called error rates.
Under the U.S. Senate plan, those with error rates below 6% would pay nothing, while states with error rates above 10% would pay for 15% of their food assistance benefits.
Ohio food banks are serving more people than ever, budget would maintain funding at 2019 levels

According to the Food Research and Access Center, Ohio’s 2023 error rate would put it in the bucket of states paying for 5% of their SNAP benefits.
Back of the envelope math, that would put Ohio on the hook for about $178 million. In addition to covering a portion of benefits, the proposal asks states to cover three quarters of administrative costs and imposes more stringent work requirements.
If the current state budget process offers any indication those figures are a nonstarter.
During the last budget cycle Ohio lawmakers gave food banks an extra $7.5 million on top of the $24.5 million base appropriation they’ve received since 2019.
But this year, lawmakers zeroed out that supplemental funding, arguing it was always meant to be a one-time thing. Food banks argued they’re getting more traffic than ever, and argued at the very least, lawmakers should give them a $5 million increase to account for inflation.
Lawmakers didn’t budge.

An “unsustainable, unrealistic cost shift”
In Grove City on Thursday, representatives from Ohio’s food assistance network warned the state simply can’t absorb the SNAP reductions Congress is considering.
Standing in front of wall of glass wall looking out on their warehouse, Mid-Ohio Food Collective President and CEO Matt Habash, bragged they have “three football fields of storage” and serve people in need “from Marysville clear to the Ohio River.”
“But as impressive as Mid-Ohio Food Bank is,” he said, “It’s never been our community’s best our biggest weapon against hunger. That, my friends, is SNAP.”
Habash argued the program is the “first line of defense” against hunger and a “lifeline” to low-income seniors, children, and people with disabilities. He warned pushing benefit costs onto states would “end SNAP as we know it.”
“This cost shift would force impossible decisions by our state leaders to raise taxes or cut essential services all while hunger increases,” he said. “These cuts will do the most harm to the most vulnerable neighbors.”
“The meals that go missing,” he added, “will be far more than our hunger relief network could ever possibly provide.”
Habash urged Ohioans to contact the state’s Republican U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted. The Ohio Capital Journal contacted both senator’s offices for comment about the SNAP plan. Neither responded.
Jamie Trout, executive director of Eastside Community Ministry in Zanesville, heads up the biggest food pantry in Muskingum County. Over the last three years, she explained, they’ve seen visitors triple, while the cost of groceries has spiked.
“To try to wrap my mind around the amount of people that will be coming for our services if the SNAP benefits are cut,” she said, “I just don’t see how we would sustain that.”
Ohio Association of Foodbanks Executive Director Joree Novotny added that SNAP benefits wind up helping the local economy as well as hungry families. Food assistance dollars get spent at local grocery stores and farmers markets. In economic downturns, that cash influx provides a backstop for some businesses.
“The state of Ohio cannot absorb hundreds of millions of dollars in new spending,” she said of the cost sharing plan. “(Ohio) would either have to increase taxes to raise revenue, cut other essential services, or risk losing billions of dollars every year in economic activity that supports Ohio retailers, agribusinesses and neighbors.”
She called the plan “unsustainable” and “unrealistic,” and urged Ohio’s congressional delegation to reject those provisions.
“A hungry child cannot learn, a hungry worker cannot earn, and a hungry senior is not healthy,” she said.

Pat Proctor, a Republican from Leavenworth, speaks to House members during an April 10, 2025, debate. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — As Kansas Rep. Pat Proctor launched his campaign to oversee state elections, he honed in on a signature phrase that would serve his interest of dismissing critics — and reporting by Kansas Reflector — while appealing to far-right voters.
His ambiguous “axis of ballot harvesting” serves as a catchall for anyone who challenges his false claims about the hazards of early voting, and signals a vast make-believe conspiracy by foreign nationals to undermine elections.
Proctor frequently repeats the phrase on the campaign trail, and used it in a fundraising message where he suggested a new law could be used to bring criminal or civil charges against Kansas Reflector.
When video surfaced in April of Proctor asserting that women stole the 2022 election on abortion, he falsely claimed the video had been doctored by voting rights advocates at the core of the so-called “axis.”
And when three nonprofits filed a lawsuit in early May to challenge new restrictions on early voting, Proctor exclaimed on social media: “The axis of ballot harvesting strikes again!”
The Leavenworth Republican declined to answer questions from Kansas Reflector seeking clarity about his contradictory comments and a definition of “the axis of ballot harvesting,” echoing President George W. Bush’s use of “axis of evil” to describe nations propping up terrorism in the early 2000s. Proctor, a retired Army colonel serving his third, two-year term in the state House, also declined to identify an example of anything Kansas Reflector has published that is inaccurate.
Instead, Proctor responded with the following statement: “Here’s a quote for you: ‘You are a partisan hack and your so-called ‘newspaper’ is a woke, leftist propaganda rag.’ Thanks for the opportunity to comment.”
The response is consistent with Proctor’s frequent criticism — including personal attacks on social media — of journalists who accurately report on him.
So far, Proctor is the only Republican to file for secretary of state in next year’s election cycle. The job involves overseeing voter registration in Kansas and guiding county-level administrators on election policy.
Republican Rep. Ken Rahjes, of Agra, plans to join the race. In an interview, Rahjes didn’t criticize Proctor.  Rahjes said he is focused on “making sure our elections are safe, secure, and that Kansans have confidence that their vote is counted.”
“If you look at the outcomes of the last three presidential elections in Kansas, Donald Trump has won all three,” Rahjes said. “It looks like those elections have turned out the way that the people in Kansas have wanted.”
In contrast, Proctor calls for restrictions on early voting — even though he acknowledges that he personally enjoys the convenience of voting early. And after launching his campaign for secretary of state in early April, Proctor has criticized voting rights groups — Loud Light, Kansas Appleseed, League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas — who challenge his proposals in legislative hearings and in court.
Loud Light circulated on social media a video clip of Proctor speaking at a June 20, 2024, forum on elections that was published on Rumble, the far-right alternative to YouTube.
During the forum, Proctor recalled the fierce campaign ahead of Kansas’ August 2022 vote on abortion rights. Kansans overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment to strip those rights, and post-election audits and recounts affirmed the integrity of the election. Illegal voting is exceedingly rare in Kansas, as a federal judge ruled in 2018, as it is in the rest of the U.S.
But Proctor said he was going around to polling places in advance of the August 2022 election, “and there’s, like, all these, like, women, like 20- to 30-year-old women who, you know, that you never saw at the polls before, and it’s like a long line, got a long line, and they’re all there to vote, and it’s just the — it’s they’re stealing it fair and square.”
The Loud Light clip was unaltered, but when Proctor was asked during an April 19 town hall in Leavenworth to explain his comments, he replied: “That’d be really terrible if I’d actually said that.”
“They chopped up a video to make it look like I said that 20- and 30-year-old women were stealing the election by voting, or something like that,” Proctor said.
Melissa Stiehler, advocacy director for Loud Light, said in an interview that she was bothered by Proctor’s willingness to “drift further away from the truth” and “really embrace things that he knows to be lies.”
“We’ve had these conversations behind closed doors in the past. He knows that these things aren’t true, and yet he’s embracing this culture of conspiracy theories for his own political gain, which is desperate and shameless,” Stiehler said.
In an April 12 fundraising email, Proctor warned of “a shadowy collection of groups I call the ‘axis of ballot harvesting.'” His targets included Loud Light and States Newsroom, the parent organization of Kansas Reflector.
Proctor’s email said Kansas Reflector “is part of a vast, dark money, left-wing propaganda machine called States Newsroom.” He said “a significant percentage of that organization’s funding” comes from foreign sources, including the Swiss businessman Hansjörg Wyss.
States Newsroom follows all laws regarding nonprofits and does not accept donations from foreign-based entities. The U.S.-based Wyss Foundation’s $1.14 million grant to States Newsroom in 2020 has never been a secret. On its website, States Newsroom publishes an extensive list of donors who have contributed more than $1,000, as well as its 990 tax forms. The organization’s annual fundraising exceeds $20 million to support nonprofit news operations, including Kansas Reflector, in 39 states.
“As Chair of the House Committee on Elections, in response to this threat, I introduced House Bill 2106 to begin the process of getting foreign money completely out of Kansas politics,” Proctor wrote. “This first-step bill requires organizations campaigning for or against constitutional amendments to ensure and certify that they have not accepted foreign money over the preceding four years or face serious civil and criminal consequences.”
He then said the law would prevent “foreign nationals like Hansjörg Wyss from improperly influencing Kansas elections.”
HB 2106 requires any entity “who engages in any activity promoting or opposing” a proposed constitutional amendment to certify that each donor is not a “foreign national,” and that each donor has not received more than $100,000 from any foreign national within a four-year period.
Kansas Reflector reports on the stakes of policies and elections but doesn’t advocate for or against ballot questions or candidates.
Proctor offered a different interpretation of the law during a Feb. 4 hearing in his committee, where Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose appeared via video to complain about States Newsroom.
“We are not about to legislate who can spend money doing news in the state of Kansas, OK. We’re not going to touch that with a 10-foot pole,” Proctor said at the time.
The Legislature adopted the bill with veto-proof bipartisan support — 94-25 in the House and 39-0 in the Senate — in advance of next year’s vote on a constitutional amendment that would replace the current nominating system for Kansas Supreme Court justices with statewide elections for judicial candidates. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly allowed HB 2106 to become law without her signature.
An abortion-rights advocacy group has filed a federal lawsuit to try to block the law from taking effect.
Stiehler said Proctor’s language in the fundraising email was “really teetering on the line of at least some dog whistle language of antisemitic, globalist conspiracy theories.”
“This is a lot of hullabaloo,” she said. “He’s making up a fake problem and making up a fake enemy to try and create and drive the fear, to prove that only he is the one to fix it. And it’s all based on lies and nonsense.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P4100417b-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-13 04:57:08.448345

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)The major issue this year and every year for the state’s nonprofit community mental health centers (CMHCs) is financial stability and sustainability. Closely connected to that is the continuing challenge of attracting and retaining workforce for our centers. The most recent monthly workforce report prepared for the New Hampshire Community Behavioral Health Association (CBHA) shows that 1 in 10 funded positions at the CMHCs are vacant.
The CMHCs and CBHA have worked diligently on workforce development for nearly a decade now with our health care partners, our champions in the Legislature, and state agencies, and we believe that progress is finally being made, albeit slowly. But an amendment added to this year’s state budget — a prohibition on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives — will complicate those efforts, and for no good reason. 
At the heart of the mission of New Hampshire’s community mental health system is creating a more inclusive community for those who suffer from mental illness. Striking down this concept runs afoul of what is a core principle of the state’s system. Thus, it seems odd to now be advancing legislation that undermines more inclusive acceptance of those with a behavioral health illness.
It is important to point out that the “DEI” language inserted into the budget bill was never presented at a policy committee, which meant that the CMHCs, other advocates, and members of the public did not have ample opportunity to tell legislators about the negative impacts of the prohibition. This opinion piece can therefore be considered as the CMHCs’ testimony opposing a nongermane amendment that did not spring from any real problem in New Hampshire that needs fixing.
For the last eight years, the majority in the Legislature, the governor, and the mental health system have worked hard to make progress in the mental health space, with demonstrable improvements in patient outcomes and growing the workforce. Passing this DEI provision will undo so much of the good work being done, by burdening for-profits and nonprofits alike to upend their business models in order to comply with a mandate that otherwise would have never come about. 
While the DEI language being proposed in the state budget is primarily directed at schools, it also impacts municipalities, businesses, nonprofits, and entities that contract with the state. Requiring the community mental health centers to scour their contracts for and remove any references to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives creates an additional, significant, and completely unnecessary administrative burden for the centers. 
Exit interviews for staff at CMHCs regularly reveal that the already overwhelming number of administrative burdens — reporting requirements, rules, and often duplicative forms and audits, imposed by the state, the federal government, and the MCOs — is the main reason our staff leave for other jobs. CBHA and the CMHCs have repeatedly presented the state with lists of these administrative burdens and have asked for relief. The proposed DEI requirement adds a new one that is not well-defined and that will undoubtedly create confusion and more unnecessary tasks for our staff.
It will also impede efforts to attract new staff to the CMHCs and to the state. New Hampshire can’t afford to turn people away right now, and imposing this bureaucratic action on our practices will jeopardize our citizens’ ability to access the care they need in their communities. The DEI language, poorly written as it is, sends a clear message to the very people we need most in our health care workforce: that New Hampshire is focused more on forcing ideological statements on the CMHCs and other providers than on ensuring care for individuals who need it. 
The proposed DEI prohibition will do nothing but damage the progress we are making in ensuring access to mental health care for all our citizens. The governor has made it very clear that she does not want to see us going backward on mental health, and we applaud her for being a great champion for the community mental health system. We hope the House and Senate conferees now working on the final spending plan will delete the DEI prohibition from the budget bill before it reaches her desk. New Hampshire’s community mental health workforce remains committed to serving the needs of their patients, first and foremost, and we trust that our elected officials support us in achieving that goal.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/statehousenatgas-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-13 04:57:08.448345

The need for help putting food on the table is growing in Ohio.
Last year’s visits to the state’s network of food pantries were nearly 16 million, including repeat customers, according to the Ohio Association of Foodbanks.
“The fact is that, unfortunately, the need for food is at an all-time high,” Kristin Warzocha with Greater Cleveland Food Bank said.
Now, Warzocha is bracing for a tough year.
“We are expecting changes that could result in up to 8 million less pounds of food next year,” she said. “That’s a 15% decrease — that’s without additional public or private support.”
Ohio food banks are currently receiving $32.5 million from the state. But typically, they’ve been receiving about $24.5 million since 2019. In the last budget, they were given a one-time supplement of $7.5 million due to extra COVID-19 dollars and increased need. Now they would be going back to $24.5 million — despite the surge in need and inflation.
The food banks asked for about $30 million this year — a $5 million bump due to inflation and need. They didn’t receive it in the governor’s, Ohio House’s or Ohio Senate’s budgets. This means they are set to face a 23% reduction in funding from the state from Fiscal Year 2025 to 2026.
The Children’s Hunger Alliance (CHA) is also facing a greater need, the organization states. Their weekend meals program has tripled in size and has an extensive waitlist, CHA said. They were asking for several million more to keep up with demand.
The governor gave them their current funding, but both the Ohio House and Ohio Senate passed bills that cut the CHA budget from $7.5 million to $5 million.
Hunger prevention advocates are hoping that lawmakers change their minds before the end of June. Legislative leaders are going into conference committee, closed-door meetings, to negotiate and draft a final budget — but food isn’t on their minds.
Asked about what “must-haves” in the budget, Ohio Senate President Rob McColley said he thinks there are a lot of good things in the Senate version.
“We obviously don’t want to reveal too much, but we’re firm believers in some of the big items. The flat tax is something that we feel pretty strongly about,” McColley responded.
McColley and his chamber have passed a 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state — those making more than $100,000 a year — will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax. This would make them equal to the lower tax bracket.
State data shows that the flat tax could cause a more than $1 billion loss to the general revenue fund.
“The dollars that we’re foregoing in the flat tax are already incorporated into our overall spending,” Senate Finance Chair Cirino, R-Kirtland, said.
Programs have been cut to make up for it, he said.
This includes money for food assistance, schools, Medicaid, libraries, lead abatement, addiction services, and child care, which have all decreased from the current status or from the governor’s budget.
Asked whether the Ohio House or Ohio Senate version of the budget was better, state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said both are bad, and that she favored the governor’s budget. But when answering the question, she said the Senate’s is more detrimental.
“A lot of the House was flat funding, which is still a cut given inflation, but the Senate is where we’re seeing real actual programs, taking away dollars from existing programs,” Sweeney, D-Westlake, said.
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, is on board with the tax cut.
Asked how he felt about McColley going into the conference committee already saying there were some non-negotiables, Huffman said he “could probably list off a bunch of things that are non-negotiable unless somebody wants to go ahead and negotiate with them.”
“I think the flat tax is a great idea, so maybe they already knew that, so they could say it was non-negotiable,” he said.
Huffman has always been interested in either eliminating the income tax or getting to a flat tax — but he, in mid-May, said this needed to be something done responsibly.
“Any reduction like that needs to be coupled with… ‘On the other side of the ledger, where are the spending cuts going to be?'” Huffman said. “I know that there’s sort of a thought of, ‘Well, just cut it and we’ll figure that out later, but that’s not what you’re doing in budgets.”
He continued, noting that he wasn’t sure how big a change going from 3.5% to 2.75% truly was.
“The time to have a significant change in (income tax) is a plan you would have brought forth a year ago and then said, ‘Here’s what we’re going to do with the budget with different cuts,'” Huffman said.
Gov. Mike DeWine was not interested in a flat tax.
“There is not one company that said to us, ‘We can’t come to Ohio because your taxes are too high,’… We are now extremely competitive,'” DeWine said back when announcing his budget in February.
Warzocha said she will continue working to make sure no one goes hungry, even with the expected funding cuts at both the state and federal levels.
“We have been reaching out to our community, and our community is responding,” she said.
The budget has a deadline to be passed by July 1.

Ohio’s 442 craft breweries brought in $1.29 billion of economic activity in 2024, according to the Ohio Craft Brewers Association economic and fiscal impact of Ohio’s craft brewing industry. This is an increase from 2022 when Ohio breweries contributed $1.27 billion to the economy.

Ohio’s craft beer industry had 9,753 direct jobs and an additional 2,502 indirect jobs sustaining 8,095 Ohio households, according to the biennial report. 
Beer was flowing in Ohio with 1.15 million barrels brewed. Ohio craft breweries generated an estimated $128.6 million of state and local taxes and $99.1 million of federal taxes in 2024, according to the report. 
The number of craft breweries in Ohio continued to go up. There were 45 in 2011, 135 in 2015, 300 in 2018, 357 in 2020, 420 in 2022, and 442 in 2024, according to the report. 53 breweries are in planning around the state.

The Northwest region had 41 craft breweries that brewed 17,000 barrels of beer for an economic impact of $78 million. 
The North Central region had 37 craft breweries that brewed 10,000 barrels of beer for an economic impact of $36.1 million. 
The Greater Cleveland region had 59 craft breweries that brewed 209,000 barrels of beer for an economic impact of $231 million. 
The Northeast region had 49 craft breweries that brewed 26,000 barrels of beer for an economic impact of $71.2 million. 
The State Line region had 46 craft breweries that brewed 9,000 barrels of beer for an economic impact of $34.8 million. 
The West Central region had 39 craft breweries that brewed 16,000 barrels of beer for an economic impact of $60.7 million. 
The Greater Columbus region had 56 craft breweries that brewed 159,000 barrels of beer for an economic impact of $184 million. 
The Greater Cincinnati region had 50 craft breweries that brewed 669,000 barrels of beer for an economic impact of $495.6 million. 
The Southwest region had 33 craft breweries that brewed 16,000 barrels of beer for an economic impact of $45.7 million. 
The Southeast region had 32 craft breweries that brewed 19,000 barrels of beer for an economic impact of $52.4 million. 

Ohio breweries will likely see the effects of new tariffs on aluminum, steel and malted barley. 
A tariff is a tax on imported goods and President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on aluminum and steel imported into the United States, and a 25% tariff on Canadian barley. 
There were 9,796 craft breweries across the country in 2024. 
Last year was the first year since 2005 that there were more brewery closing than openings nationwide — with 430 new breweries and 529 breweries closed, according to the Brewers Association.

Earlier in June, President Donald Trump deployed thousands of National Guard troops and Marines to quell anti-deportation protests and secure federal buildings in downtown Los Angeles.
The move, some historians say, harks back 55 years to May 4, 1970, when Ohio’s Republican governor summoned the National Guard to deal with students demonstrating against the Vietnam War at Kent State University. Guard members were ordered to fire over the students’ heads to disperse the crowd, but some couldn’t hear because they were wearing gas masks. The troops fired at the students instead, killing four and wounding another nine.
The shooting served as a cautionary tale about turning the military on civilians. “Dispatching California National Guard troops against civilian protesters in Los Angeles chillingly echoes decisions and actions that led to the tragic Kent State shooting,” Brian VanDeMark, author of the book “Kent State: An American Tragedy,” wrote this week for The Conversation.
We asked VanDeMark, a history professor at the United States Naval Academy, more about the parallels between 1970 and today. His interview has been edited for length and clarity.
After the Kent State shooting, it became taboo for presidents or governors to even consider authorizing military use of force against civilians. Is the shadow of Kent State looming over Los Angeles?
VanDeMark: For young people today, 55 years ago seems like a very long time. For the generation that came of age during the ‘60s and were in college during that period, Kent State is a defining event, shaping their views of politics and the military.
There are risks inherent in deploying the military to deal with crowds and protesters. At Kent State, the county prosecutor warned the governor that something terrible could happen if he didn’t shut down the campus after the guard’s arrival. The university’s administration did not want the guard brought to campus because they understood how provocative that would be to student protesters who were very anti-war and anti-military. It’s like waving a red flag in front of a bull. The military is not trained or equipped to deal well with crowd control. It is taught to fight and kill, and to win wars.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has said that deploying the guard to Los Angeles is inflammatory. What do you fear most about this new era of domestic military deployment?
People’s sense of history probably goes back five or 10 years rather than 40 or 50. That’s regrettable. The people making these decisions — I can’t unpack their motivation or perceptions — but I think their sense of history in terms of the dangers inherent in deploying U.S. troops to deal with street protests is itself a problem.
There are parallels between Kent State and Los Angeles. There are protesters throwing bottles at police and setting fires. The Ohio governor called the Kent State protesters dissidents and un-American; President Trump has called the Los Angeles demonstrators insurrectionists, although he appears to have walked that back. What do you make of these similarities?
The parallels are rather obvious. The general point I wish to make, without directing it at a particular individual, is that the choice of words used to describe a situation has consequences. Leaders have positions of responsibility and authority. They have a responsibility to try to keep the situation under control.
Are officers today more apt to use rubber bullets and other so-called less-lethal rounds than in 1970? Even though these rounds do damage, they’re less likely to kill. Could that save lives today?
Most likely, yes. In 1970, the guard members at Kent State, all they had were tear gas canisters and assault rifles loaded with live ammunition. Lessons have been learned between 1970 and today, and I’m almost certain that the California National Guard is equipped with batons, plastic shields, and other tools that give them a range of options between doing nothing and killing someone.
I’ve touched one of the bullets used at Kent State. It was five and a half inches long. You can imagine the catastrophic damage that can inflict on the human body. Those bullets will kill at 1,000 yards, so the likelihood that the military personnel in Los Angeles have live ammunition is very remote.
Trump authorized the deployment of federal troops not only to Los Angeles but also to wherever protests are “occurring or are likely to occur,” leading to speculation that the presence of troops will become permanent. Was that ever a consideration in the ‘60s and ‘70s, or are we in uncharted waters here?
In the 1960s and early 1970s, presidents of both parties were very reluctant to deploy military forces against protests. Has that changed? Apparently it has. I personally believe that the military being used domestically against American citizens, or even people living here illegally, is not the answer. Generally speaking, force is not the answer. The application of force is inherently unpredictable. It’s inherently uncontrollable. And very often the consequences of using it are terrible human suffering.
Before the Kent State shooting, the assumption by most college-aged protesters was that there weren’t physical consequences to engaging in protests. Kent State demonstrated otherwise. In Los Angeles, the governor, the mayor, and all responsible public officials have essentially said they will not tolerate violence or the destruction of property. I think that most of the protesters are peaceful. What concerns me is the small minority who are unaware of our history and don’t understand the risks of being aggressive toward the authorities.
In Los Angeles, we have not just the guard but also the Marines. Marines, as you mentioned, are trained to fight wars. What’s the worst that could happen here? 
People could get killed. I don’t know what’s being done in terms of defining rules of engagement, but I assume that the Marines have explicitly been told not to load live ammunition in their weapons because that would risk violence and loss of life. I don’t think that the guard or the Marines are particularly enthusiastic about having to apply coercive force against protesters. Their training in that regard is very limited, and their understanding of crowd psychology is probably very limited.
The crowd psychology is inherently unpredictable and often nonlinear. If you don’t have experience with crowds, you may end up making choices based on your lack of experience that are very regrettable.








Some people are imploring the Marines and guard members to refuse the orders and stay home. You interviewed guard members who were at Kent State. Do you think the troops deployed to Los Angeles will come to regret it?
Very often, and social science research has corroborated this, when authorities respond to protests and interact with protesters in a respectful fashion, that tends to have a calming effect on the protesters’ behavior. But that’s something learned through hard experience, and these Marines and guard members don’t have that experience.
The National Guard was deployed in Detroit in 1967; Washington, D.C. in 1968; Los Angeles in 1965 and 1992; and Minneapolis and other cities in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd. Have the Marines ever been deployed? Or any other military branch?
Yes. In 1992, in the wake of the Rodney King controversy, the California governor at the time, a Republican named Pete Wilson, asked President George H.W. Bush to deploy not only the guard but also the Marines to deal with street riots in Los Angeles. That’s the last time it was done.
And how did that go?
I’m not an expert on this, but I assure you that the senior officers who commanded those Marines made it very clear that they were not to discharge their weapons without explicit permission from the officers themselves, and they were probably told not to load their weapons with live ammunition.
In 1967, during the Detroit riots, the Michigan National Guard was called out to the streets of Detroit. When the ranking senior officer arrived, he ordered the soldiers to remove their bullets from their rifles.

(Elaine Cromie / Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
The Detroit school board on Tuesday night adopted a $1 billion spending plan for the next school year that maintains funding for programs at their current levels, extends an incentive program that pays students to attend high school, and invests in a new pilot program to provide yellow bus transportation for students at two high schools.
But there’s still some uncertainty about the budget approved for the Detroit Public Schools Community District. The Michigan Legislature has yet to approve a state budget that will outline how much per-pupil funding public schools will receive. And there are unknowns about federal funding.
Because of that, “we will then bring back a budget amendment in the fall,” Jeremy Vidito, the district’s chief finance officer, said during a budget hearing.
The budget assumes Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s proposed 4.1% increase — $392 — in the per-pupil foundation allowance. The minimum amount a district can receive would increase to $10,000 per student. DPSCD receives the minimum.
The district’s $1.09 billion in expenditures is less than the current year’s amount of $1.12 billion. The decline is not related to cuts in programs, but instead due to a change in the state made in how it allocates pension funds to school districts.
Here are some of the budget priorities included in the adopted budget:
 Budget focuses on literacy support for students

The budget includes $38 million from the state as part of the settlement of a literacy lawsuit. This is the second year that the settlement money, which totaled $94 million, is included in the budget. For the next school year, it will go toward a number of efforts, including hiring additional academic interventionists, hiring additional teachers to lower class sizes, and paying tutor stipends.
The settlement was from a historic lawsuit filed against the state on behalf of seven Detroit public school students who alleged that they were denied the opportunity to have a quality education because of poor building conditions, a shortage of textbooks and other learning materials, and poorly qualified teachers. It was filed during a period in which the state oversaw the district because of its massive debt.
 A new pilot aims to improve attendance with bus transportation

The district is launching a new transportation pilot program aimed at reducing chronic absenteeism that will provide yellow school busing for students attending Henry Ford High School and East English Village @ Finney. High school students in the district currently must take city buses provided by the Detroit Department of Public Transportation to get to and from school. There are exceptions, including for some students with disabilities and students who are homeless. The pilot will mean students who live within the boundaries of the two schools can hop on yellow school buses for transportation.
“We want to see if yellow buses will improve student attendance vs. the current high school bus model,” Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told Chalkbeat in an email.
During the 2023-24 school year, 88% of the students at Henry Ford and 94% of the students at East English Village were considered chronically absent. A student is considered chronically absent in Michigan if they miss 10% or more of a school year. The district’s overall chronic absenteeism rate for that school year was 66%.
 The district will continue attendance incentive that pays students

Another effort at improving attendance is an incentive program the district launched in January to pay students with $200 gift cards every two weeks if they have perfect attendance. Throughout the course of the incentive, which ran through March, students could earn a total of $1,000 in gift cards.
The program will be funded through the next school year.
Data showed that while many of the students who earned the gift cards were already consistent school attenders, the incentive did improve attendance and reduced chronic absenteeism.
It’s unclear how much the district has budgeted for both the attendance incentive or the bus pilot.

(Stock photo from Getty Images.)People who are convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic abuse or subject to a qualifying protective order aren’t allowed to have firearms according to federal law, but actually separating them from their guns is another matter. Often, abusers can deny having or refuse to surrender their firearms, and in states that have not passed their own versions of the federal ban — which, among other limitations, does not itself mandate how or when subjects should relinquish guns they already have in their possession — the process can be even more precarious.
Ohio is one of the states that hang in the balance. Judges in Ohio have the discretion to require the surrender of firearms because of a civil protection order — a temporary order to remove guns from a potentially dangerous person — but there is no legal statute requiring the relinquishment of firearms following an order.
In Ohio, more than 188,000 people are victims of intimate partner violence annually, and the state loses $1.2 billion every year because of the pervasive violence, according to a 2025 report by the Ohio Domestic Violence Network. But Ohio is not unique; access to firearms is a key factor in the lethality of intimate partner violence. Research studies estimate that, in instances where a domestic abuser has access to a gun, a victim is five times more likely to die, and the rate of intimate partner firearm homicides in the United States is substantially higher than in other similar-income countries.
The Advisory Committee on Domestic Violence through the Supreme Court of Ohio noticed that because of the disconnect in federal and state law, there was a gap in potential abusers surrendering their firearms. The committee came up with an unusual solution: paperwork.
Members argued that the lack of legal follow-up after the issuance of protection orders could be remedied by the state’s 10-F Form, implemented in 2021. When law enforcement goes to serve a protection order, they use the form to ask a subject if they have access to firearms, securing them if so, keeping them in storage, or noting whether they deny having access to weapons at all. Then the form gets placed in a court’s docket, leaving a paper trail if there’s a violation later.
“This really is a tool that can be used as a way to clarify, does someone have weapons, and if this person is lying, it could be the basis of another charge or a violation of that protection order,” said Alexandria Ruden, a member of the advisory committee and a supervising attorney with Legal Aid Society of Cleveland.
Ruden, who has worked in domestic violence law for four decades, emphasized that shootings are among the most common ways victims are killed. She and her colleagues have participated in training sessions on the 10-F Form across Ohio. But she explained that there are roadblocks to successful implementation, like having a place to store weapons after they have been seized. Though Ruden emphasized the practicality of the form, she said the need for a state statute is crucial to truly protect victims.
“If we were able to codify federal law regarding qualifying protection orders, and the qualifying misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, then the implementation of this form would be much easier to work with,” Ruden said.
The difference in state approaches can have significant consequences for victims.








“The place you live, not only the state but the county that you live in, can dictate what protections under the law that you have, and how safe you will be,” said Dr. April Zeoli, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health who has researched the relationship between firearm access and intimate partner violence.
“We see these differences when it comes to domestic violence protection order firearm restrictions,” Zeoli told me. “States that have these restrictions see decreases in domestic violence partner homicide compared to states that don’t, and that is very frustrating.”
Different states are implementing strategies to address intimate partner gun violence. In 2017, Washington became the first state to alert domestic violence survivors when an abuser tries to buy a gun. Other recent efforts have focused on securing financial support for those at risk, like Colorado’s voter-approved gun tax to fund services for domestic violence victims. Earlier this year, Illinois passed a law clarifying the surrender process, requiring law enforcement to quickly seize firearms from people with protection orders against them.
In Louisiana, even as federal laws have weakened, local leaders are still committed to keeping firearms out of the hands of abusers. Lafourche Parish Sheriff’s Lieutenant Valerie Martinez-Jordan spearheaded an innovative firearm divestiture program that has since spread across the deep-red state. (Read my colleague Alma Beauvais’s story for more.)
  Extreme Risk Protection Orders, commonly referred to as red flag laws, are legal tools that temporarily remove firearms from people who are deemed to be at high risk for committing violence.


These varied approaches are innovative, but as in Ohio, they are not being implemented without challenges. Some of the Trump administration’s recent budget cuts have targeted domestic violence services. The actions on the federal level will have residual effects for organizations throughout the country.
Still, the state actions show momentum for addressing the relationship between firearm violence and domestic violence. The 10-F form is just one example of recent efforts that are focused on less punitive approaches.
Ruden, who has worked in intimate partner violence law since the Domestic Violence Act was enacted in 1979, told me that she looks forward to the day that she’s “out of a job,” but that there’s a lot of work left to do. Often, she said, creating policies to counter intimate partner violence is a process that takes two steps back after taking a step forward. Still, these innovations represent hope.
“I am hopeful even now that what we are able to do with this particular piece is to focus on getting law enforcement to ask” about guns when a protection order is served, Ruden said. “‘Do you have weapons?’ or ‘Let me take your weapons.’”

(Christopher Gregory/Getty Images)It’s been 10 years since Donald Trump, a real estate mogul and reality TV star, rode an escalator down to a New York City press conference announcing his entry into the presidential campaign.
On that day — June 16, 2015 — Trump’s candidacy seemed more like a publicity stunt and his presidency seemed like dark fantasy. Before the event that day, music from the “Phantom of the Opera” played on repeat. The campaign paid people to attend as Trump said Mexico was sending “rapists” across the border.
“I don’t think anybody came away from that announcement thinking he was going to be the next president,” said Charlotte Alter, who attended the announcement for Time magazine.
And yet, here we are.
After 10 years, we are living in Trump’s America, an era defined by his policies, his rhetoric and even his fashion. It’s a golden anniversary, if only because of Trump’s penchant for lacquering everything with the color gold.
While Kansas in 2015 was distant from Trump’s Big Apple glitz and power, the state has undeniably been changed by Trump’s two presidencies and three candidacies.
My list focuses on issues that particularly impact Kansans. There also are national changes.
With that caveat, here is my list of 10 ways that life in Kansas has shifted since the president rode that Trump Tower escalator 10 years ago.
1. Abortion politics
When Kansas voters protected abortion rights in an August 2022 ballot measure, it signaled red-state resistance. During the Trump decade, national political attention rarely — if ever — focused on Kansas as much as that moment.
While the Supreme Court — increasingly of Trump’s construction — ruled that the Constitution does not guarantee abortion rights, voters in the largely conservative state of Kansas pushed back.
Since then, the number of abortions in Kansas has risen, and a majority of abortions have been performed for patients from out-of-state.
The Kansas ballot results showed Democrats the popularity of their position on reproductive rights.
2. Increasing polarization
The acrimonious retreat to our partisan corners during the Trump decade contains so many anecdotes, so much data and so many consequences that it seems reductive to boil it down as a single item on this list.
The United States — and Kansans — are divided. On one side, the religious devotion of the MAGA faithful. On the other, the liberal and currently impotent resistance. While many kind folks in my life describe themselves as “moderates” or “centrists,” you wouldn’t know it by watching Fox News, logging into Truth Social or reading the comment section anywhere online.
The mudslinging of politics that we bemoaned in past decades seems quaint by today’s standards. Following Trump’s lead, we empty entire dump trucks of vitriol on each other. The other political party? They are the enemy.
3. Suspicion of immigrants
Starting with his announcement 10 years ago, Trump’s rhetoric has targeted immigration over the southern border with Mexico. Trump has banned travel from Muslim-majority countries, demanded that Mexico pay for a border wall and unleashed lies against immigrants, particularly those from Mexico, Central America and South America.
How could this not impact Kansans?
The second largest racial group in Kansas, after white, is hispanic. According to the US Census, 13% of Kansans identify as hispanic.
Local activists report that agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been more visible in the state during Trump’s second term and they worry that organized sweeps will come to the state soon. In Kansas City, immigration attorneys report that many clients aren’t attending their scheduled hearings out of fear that agents will arrest them outside their hearing and deport them.
4. Rollback in climate change acceptance
A recent study found that Kansas and Missouri farmers are reluctant to voice their opinions on climate change, regardless of their point of view. This seems part of Trump’s effort to take climate change from settled science to political fulcrum.
To state a few obvious things, Kansas agriculture is vital and relies on a climate that allows for productive harvests. Climate change threatens that.
Kansas agriculture is weaker after twice having a president who withdrew us from key climate agreements while misrepresenting basic facts: the causes of wildfires, the paths of hurricanes and the virtues of renewable energy.
5. Undermining facts, education and expertise
Trump’s cynical rhetoric started with one phrase: fake news.
He used the phrase to bulldoze over any empirical resistance, whether from journalists, academics or lawyers. As he saw it, anyone who opposed him was peddling something dishonest.
Fast forward 10 years. The spread of measles in Kansas during recent months is a pointed symbol of the everpresent doubts that Trump and his administration have created. As diseases like measles sprout from obscurity, we can see Trump’s actions as a unique fertilizer: COVID-19 vaccine denialism, appointment of a vaccine skeptic in his cabinet and skepticism of anyone who claims expertise.
6. Instability for agriculture sales and research
Cuts to federal spending on agriculture research will likely threaten our status, as Americans and Kansans, as leaders in worldwide agriculture. Expect more stories from Kansas with headlines like these:

K-State ag research projects ended after DOGE cuts off USAID funding
Rural Kansas hit by federal job cuts as programs grind to a halt
Kansas City USDA food program cuts could leave some without enough food

Those stories touch on immediate effects. Consider the long-term effects on agriculture. Things will get more dire for Kansans. Not knowing why honeybees are dying? The threat of a “man-eater” screwworm? Both possibilities are looming without a functioning federal agriculture response.
This concern over research doesn’t even address the agriculture market instability caused by Trump’s tariffs.
7. Damn the norms
Kansas politicians have learned a new brand of conservatism from Trump: brash political bullying that ignores polite norms. “If we can do it, we will,” seems to be their jet fuel.
Trump’s second-term flurry of executive orders expresses this political swagger. So what if courts knock back most of the actions? In the meantime, the executive orders will have shuttered federal agencies. In the meantime, the damage is done.
Similarly, the Kansas Board of Regents in 2021 allowed campus administrators to eliminate university employees, including tenured faculty, without declaring a financial emergency. Discard precedent and don’t look back.
No surprise: Just like Trump’s executive orders, the firing of Emporia State faculty is tied up in court.
8. Luring Democrats into unwise political positions
Opposing Trump has become so reflexive over the past 10 years that Democrats have often defaulted to opposition, even when it doesn’t make empirical sense, let alone political sense.
Let’s start with COVID-19. Trump called it the Wuhan Flu, simultaneously a jingoistic swing at China and an attempt to belittle a dangerous virus. And many of his public statements (injecting bleach, anyone?) revealed his foolishness.
But the Democrats’ reaction was also imperfect — and likely carried more electoral consequences. Closing schools and demanding masking were both wildly unpopular while also not providing the desired protections.
Similarly, Democrats have spent 10 years now opposing Trump on immigration. While Trump holds many odious views on immigration, a central plank of his platform is the prevention of illegal immigration. To many Kansans, opposing Trump’s immigration policies means that liberals want to open the border. That policy seems a political folly when 45.6% of Kansans believe illegal immigrants are a “danger to public safety.”
9. Animosity toward vulnerable groups
Programs that celebrate diversity have been a hallmark of college campuses for years. Along with affirmative action — struck down by a Trump-appointed Supreme Court majority — DEI programs have vanished from Kansas education.
I understand it’s a bit reductionist to group racial diversity with LGBTQ+ issues, but the Trump administration seems equally obsessed with sexual orientation and issues affecting transgender people.
Campus protests in Kansas have pointed to the unfairness of it all. Plus, a recent lawsuit against KU (where I work) threatens to punish the university for its response.
10. Visible liberal opposition
Electoral maps from the 2024 presidential election showed Trump continuing his gains in most Kansas counties — and the Kansas Legislature remains a conservative stronghold. So it’s difficult to say that Democrats are gaining.
However, liberal opposition is more visible and galvanized during the Trump decade. Being the resistance party has brought underdog audacity to Democrats.
Kansans have protested Trump policies on abortion, immigration and COVID-19 policies. Protests are planned for Saturday in opposition to his increasingly authoritarian policies.
Defining times
The opposition has even splashed back on Elon Musk and his allegiance to Trump. A Lenexa collision center for Tesla vehicles was firebombed with Molotov cocktails in April in an incident showing how this opposition can go too far.
Living in Trump’s America has encouraged wishful thinking about a Trump exit.
On election night 2016, it was “Maybe the exit polling is wrong.” During his first term, they thought, “He’s going to get impeached and removed from office.” After losing in 2020, many Kansans hoped, “Now he will fade into obscurity.”
Instead, with more than three years remaining on his term, it’s clear that Trump’s escalator ride 10 years ago will define our modern lives as Americans and Kansans.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)More than five years after Congress passed the 2018 Farm Bill, Ohio faces a growing public health crisis. What was designed as legislation to support American farmers has instead spawned an unregulated market of lab-created intoxicants sold without oversight in gas stations, convenience stores, and smoke shops across the state. 
The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp, defined as containing less than 0.3% delta-9 THC, from the federal Controlled Substances Act. This was intended to revitalize American hemp farming for industrial purposes, but the law created an unintended loophole that chemical manufacturers quickly exploited. 
As I recently testified before the Ohio Senate General Government Committee, these intoxicating hemp products are often marketed as “hemp-derived” or “Farm Bill compliant” but the truth is much darker. In most cases, these intoxicants crowding gas station shelves are not derived from American-grown hemp. Rather, they often start with hemp-derived CBD imported primarily from countries like China and India, which is then synthetically converted through chemical processes involving acids and solvents into artificial THC.
This process essentially breaks down the CBD molecule and rebuilds it into a synthetic compound like delta-8 THC. This is a far cry from the natural plant compounds found in traditional cannabis. 
When I visited Ohio stores late last year, I purchased numerous “farm bill compliant” products containing these synthetic compounds from stores within walking distance to the Ohio Statehouse. Laboratory testing revealed these products had inconsistent potency, extremely high doses, unlisted ingredients, and chemical contaminants left over from the manufacturing process.  
This is fundamentally a public health problem. These are not merely “marijuana-lite” products, as some proponents suggest, and they have little to do with actual hemp. The chemical conversion process introduces unknown compounds and contaminants that have shown time and again they pose significant health risks. 
The synthetic nature of these products means they often contain compounds that have never been studied for safety in humans or even named by science. Reports of adverse reactions continue to increase, with poison control centers documenting rising incidents of accidental ingestion, particularly among children attracted to brightly colored packaging resembling candy. 
Data from the University of Michigan’s Monitoring the Future study recently revealed that 11% of high school seniors report using delta-8 THC. That is troubling, since delta-8 didn’t exist in the marketplace five years ago. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The FDA has repeatedly warned manufacturers about illegal sales and unsafe products, issuing dozens of warning letters. All THC edibles are federally illegal under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act – a fact that hemp intoxicants manufacturers and retailers conveniently overlook. However, without clear enforcement authority or resources, these warnings have done little to stem the tide of unregulated intoxicants flooding into communities across Ohio. 
Ohio voters made their desires clear by approving adult-use cannabis in 2023. The state is now implementing a comprehensive regulatory system for cannabis products that includes rigorous testing, packaging requirements, age verification, and consumer protections. 
This existing framework presents the most logical path forward for regulating hemp intoxicants. If these products are to exist in Ohio’s marketplace, they should be subject to the same rigorous oversight as other intoxicating cannabis products and should be sold only through licensed dispensaries with appropriate age restrictions, testing requirements, and consumer safeguards. 
We’ve heard opponents in every state argue that such regulation hurts small businesses. Yet these products have only been around for a handful of years, and convenience stores and gas stations have thrived without resorting to selling artificial THC before.
More importantly, the dangers they present, especially to young people who can currently purchase them with little or no age verification, far outweigh any economic arguments.  
Ohio would not be blazing a new trail by regulating these products. Even deeply conservative states recognize the need for oversight. Just this month, both Tennessee and Alabama, hardly  progressive strongholds, signed laws into place regulating hemp-derived intoxicants. Their law specifically prohibits synthetic cannabinoids created “by a chemical synthesis, modification, or chemical conversion from another cannabinoid,” precisely the type of products currently flooding Ohio’s unregulated market in the form of gas station weed.  
The hemp intoxicant problem represents a rare opportunity for bipartisan action in our divided political landscape. This isn’t about cannabis legalization, Ohio voters have already decided that question. It’s about ensuring that all intoxicating products, particularly synthetic ones, are properly regulated to protect public health. 
Federal regulators failed to anticipate or address this problem. Now it falls to state lawmakers to protect their constituents. Other states, including many led by conservative majorities, have already taken action. It’s time for Ohio to do the same.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — In promoting his bill to fund professional sports stadiums, Missouri Republican state Sen. Kurtis Gregory warned about the potential hit to jobs and tax revenues if the state were to lose a team.
But on the floor of the Senate last week, he acknowledged that pride was also a prime motivator in his efforts to make hundreds of millions of dollars available to the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs and MLB’s Kansas City Royals, both of which are being courted to move several miles away into neighboring Kansas.
A former University of Missouri football player, Gregory pointed to the Missouri-Kansas rivalry that dates back to the Civil War and characterized Kansas as “kind of an archrival.”
“We just let the state of Kansas poach, you know, really the pride and joy of the western side of the state, and I would say the entire state of Missouri?” he said in his floor speech. “And then I would also say, what’s next? What’s the next thing the state of Kansas is going to try and take from us?”
Days after the 2025 legislative session ended in May, Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called a special session for lawmakers to consider stadium funding and disaster relief bills. Last week, the state Senate approved Gregory’s stadium incentives bill in the middle of the night by a 19-13 vote. On Wednesday afternoon, the state House approved the measure by a 90-58 vote, sending it to the governor’s desk.
The bill would fund up to 50% of construction or renovation costs and is estimated to cost about $1.5 billion over 30 years, the Missouri Independent reported.
Stateline was unable to reach Gregory for comment.
Economists have panned the ongoing stadium bidding war between Missouri and Kansas — which has offered to pay up to 70% of new stadium costs — as a waste of taxpayer dollars. But Gregory’s comments highlight the emotional undercurrents frequently at play in sports stadium funding debates across the country.
Experts nearly unanimously agree that public subsidies for stadiums are a poor investment, but that hasn’t slowed a wave of local and state spending for billionaire team owners.
More taxpayer money benefits pro sports owners amid ‘stadium construction wave’

Washington, D.C., could spend more than $1 billion to move the Washington Commanders some seven miles from a suburb in Maryland to a new facility planned for the old RFK Stadium site, described by the team’s controlling owner as the “spiritual home” of the NFL franchise.
Geoffrey Propheter, an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who studies stadium deals, said these kinds of arguments ignore the economic reality of stadium subsidies.
“You’re not talking economics. You’re talking pure emotion,” he said.
Despite mounds of evidence showing the public does not fare well on stadium investments, he said lawmakers and mayors still tout the potential for jobs and new tax revenues with stadiums and arenas.
Oftentimes, teams and politicians stir fears about the possibility of losing franchises to another market to increase pressure, he said. But three of the most prominent stadium subsidy deals under consideration now — in Chicago, Kansas City and the district — involve teams looking to move within the same metro area.
“I would appreciate it if lawmakers were that transparent, and they’re like, ‘I don’t care how much this costs, there’s no price that’s too high for us to pay to keep them here,’” Propheter said.
 ‘Generations to get past’

But cities and states have more at stake than raw economics, said Irwin Kishner, a New York attorney who has represented pro teams in multiple stadium deals.
He likened the stadium debate to those surrounding the Olympics: Research has found that host cities generally spend well in excess of the revenue generated by the games. But cities and nations still fiercely compete for the chance to host the high-profile event.
“It elevates the status of venues,” Kishner said. “And I think it’s very much the same thing with stadiums and arenas.”
He said cities also face potential economic consequences of lost jobs and tax revenues if teams leave altogether.
Oakland, California, for example, lost both its pro football and baseball teams to Nevada after local stadium talks fell apart. The NFL’s Raiders now play in Las Vegas and MLB’s A’s are playing temporarily in West Sacramento, California, before moving into their under-construction stadium on the Vegas strip.
“What happened in Oakland is a classic example of what happens when a team doesn’t get their building in the way they want it,” Kishner said.
And those sorts of relocations can leave lasting marks, he said, pointing to the sour feelings that still persist in Brooklyn decades after MLB’s Dodgers left for Los Angeles. Other cities have similarly iconic teams, such as the NFL’s Chicago Bears.
“When push comes to shove, municipalities would be embarrassed to lose a team. I mean, could you imagine the Bears playing in St. Louis as an argument?” Kishner said. “I think Chicago would have something to say about that in a very emotional way. And by the way, these things take generations to get past.”
Currently, Chicago’s stadium discussions are more localized.
After first sharing plans to build a new stadium along Lake Michigan’s shore in Chicago, the Bears are now pursuing a massive football stadium development in suburban Arlington Heights. Despite introducing various tax measures aimed to benefit megaprojects such as stadiums, Illinois lawmakers ended their session on May 31 with no action on the matter.










My brain tells me it’s not that big of a deal, but my heart and soul as a Chicagoan doesn’t want them to leave.


– Illinois Democratic state Rep. Kam Buckner


Democratic state Rep. Kam Buckner, whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side, said lawmakers have little appetite to invest heavily in stadiums.
The MLS’ Chicago Fire just announced plans to privately finance a new $650 million professional soccer stadium in the city’s South Loop — the same area the MLB’s White Sox are also eyeing as they explore a new baseball stadium.
“The days of widespread public money for private stadiums without public benefit — those days are over, and that is not just a sentiment in the state of Illinois. I think this is a sentiment across the country,” Buckner said.
Still, he acknowledged the sway emotions can have in the matter. While the Bears leaving the city limits likely would not affect the region’s economy, he said, it would still prove a blow to morale.
“My brain tells me it’s not that big of a deal,” he said, “but my heart and soul as a Chicagoan doesn’t want them to leave.”
 Money matters

Missouri’s stadium debate has been simmering for years now: The Royals first announced plans in 2022 to move downtown from their stadium on the outskirts of the city. And the Chiefs — who share the sprawling stadium complex with the Royals — quickly followed with talks of wanting a new or renovated stadium.
After voters in a county election last year soundly rejected extending a stadium sales tax to fund those plans, lawmakers across the border in Kansas passed legislation that would fund up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums. That measure expires at the end of June, pushing Missouri legislators to act.
Neil deMause, a journalist who has written extensively about stadium subsidies, said such deadlines are arbitrary and meant to exact political pressure.
While politicians once had plausible deniability about the pitfalls of stadium subsidies, the research is now overwhelmingly clear and well covered in the media, he said. (It’s been nearly a decade since HBO’s John Oliver dedicated an episode of his satirical news show to the folly of stadium finance.)
Kansas v. Missouri stadium battle shows how states are reigniting border wars

But politicians on both sides of the aisle continue to push stadium subsidies — whether they’re touting the potential for wider real estate development or intangibles such as team pride and fears of losing franchises.
“It’s this prescribed dance, where everybody sort of pretends to be doing due diligence, but at the same time, everybody knows it’s going to happen,” deMause said.
He said that appears to be the case in the nation’s capital.
In April, city and team officials for the Washington Commanders announced plans for a 65,000-seat stadium. The proposed deal, which must be approved by the full city council, would cost taxpayers some $1.1 billion over eight years.
But deMause’s analysis of the plan determined the public will be spending well in excess of that figure because of billions in free rent and hundreds of millions in property tax breaks. He estimates taxpayers will pay or forgo at least $7.5 billion on the deal.
“Everybody in and around the D.C. Council seems to be saying, ‘Yeah, it sure is a lot of money, but the mayor really wants it, so it’s going to happen. It’s just a matter of whether or not we can improve it some,’” he said. “It’s a little bit like saying, ‘World War II is going to happen — just try and keep the death toll down.’”
Last week, Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office released a report it commissioned that projected the stadium would create billions in new economic output and local tax revenue in the coming decades — figures that were quickly disputed by skeptical economists and academics.
Still, much of the district’s stadium conversation has centered on intangibles such as hometown pride and nostalgia. Even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell waxed about his childhood memories attending games at the old RFK Stadium at an April event announcing the deal.
Sitting in front of a “WELCOME HOME” banner at that event, the mayor said the RFK site was “where they belong.”
“I want to start by saying welcome home,” she said.

(Photo by Bryan Sears/Maryland Matters)The Chesapeake Bay is being polluted with huge flows of farm pollutants and environmental greenwashing. Elected and appointed government officials are aided and abetted by supposed conservation leaders. Government officials are driven by hypocritically burnishing their Green credentials with nothing-burgers while avoiding offending polluting interests.
Some environmental organization leaders are also driven to claim significant policy successes when there are none. This is done to ensure that they do not lose governmental and private funding by criticizing the lack of meaningful measures to significantly curb Bay pollutants. These opportunists have become environmental mercenaries.
Sadly, gone are a formerly robust group of experienced environmental journalists. The few new ones are overburdened with other assignments and succumb to Greenwashing.
A prime example is the Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act. On May 14, Maryland Matters reported on the bill’s signing, dutifully quoting its progenitor, Gov. Wes Moore: “This is the most comprehensive piece of Chesapeake Bay legislation that Maryland has seen in years.”
This is a Trumpian overstatement of epic proportions reminiscent of former Gov. Larry Hogan’s discredited claim in 2019 that his efforts resulted in a Chesapeake Bay “cleaner than it has been in recorded history.”
A close examination of Moore’s Legacy legislation reveals that it does very little if anything to reduce the Bay’s major pollutants of nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment and toxic chemicals.

Maryland Matters also gave a mostly favorable boost to Moore’s “complex” legislation on Feb. 11, mostly parroting Moore and his secretary of Agriculture’s propaganda.
The reporting did note that “Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced with some fanfare in the fall that he planned to introduce legislation during this year’s General Assembly session to expand and modernize Maryland’s efforts to protect the Chesapeake Bay, telling assembled leaders from every state in the Bay watershed, ‘It’s up to us to protect it.’”  Moore was speaking as chair of the Bay Program’s Executive Council.
Moore is obviously desperate to burnish his presidential cred, as was Hogan. The legislation changes little in the status quo so as not to upset agribusiness and commercial fishing interests that might impede his presidential ambitions. From my 55 years of environmental advocacy, I can discern greenwashing, and this bill epitomizes such.
Let’s examine the Legacy Act’s details: First, a person who has a tidal fish license or commercial channa license and harvests and processes finfish on a vessel by ikejime for direct sale to restaurants need not have a food establishment license. Secondly, minor changes are made regarding the procedures for adoption of fishery management plans. Nothing is included that would better conserve crashing fish and crab populations.
Aquaculture regulations are tweaked but there are no needed changes to better advance oyster aquaculture. The bill allows publicly funded oyster restoration projects to generate water quality trading credits allowing pollution reductions from planting oysters to be traded for increased pollution elsewhere. In a separate bill, oyster poaching penalties are relaxed.
The Legacy Act establishes a Water Quality Monitoring Program in the Department of Natural Resources that simply formalizes the existing water quality monitoring system. Big deal.
But the major initiative in this grab bag is yet another voluntary agricultural program termed LEEF, Leaders in Environmentally Engaged Farming. Despite my repeated efforts to dissuade the secretary of Agriculture from such a meaningless approach that would waylay needed regulatory efforts, the legislation was enacted into law. The secretary acknowledged publicly that voluntary farm measures have failed to achieve the necessary pollution reductions.
Farmers who choose to may apply for certification to be created akin to LEED building certifications except this is entirely voluntary and there are no details on its implementation or on attaining certification levels except: Credit must be given for preserving farmland, participation in farmers markets, donations to food banks, on-farm research and for farmers lecturing about agriculture.
Instead of acting to curb the largest source of Bay-choking pollution by better regulatory measures and enforcement, and despite knowing that voluntary farm measures do not work well, LEEF would perpetuate the desecration of our environmental legacy. LEEF already was used to defeat legislation requiring riparian buffer plantings on 2,665 acres of Critical Area farmland.
Remarkably, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s president is quoted supporting this fraud: “With federal cuts and rollbacks looming heavily on our state, Maryland’s environmental leadership is more important than ever. This Act will help maintain forward momentum and ensure that investments in clean air, clean water, habitats, and local economies are secured.”
With such gubernatorial and NGO leadership, may God Save The Bay!",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0210-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-13 02:56:41.545516

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) in a file photo from February. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Senate Democrats unveiled a package of bills Thursday aimed at expanding access to health care coverage, including one bill modeled after a successful Maryland law that lets taxpayers use their tax returns to enroll in care.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen’s (D-Md.) “Easy Enrollment in Health Care Act” is one of about a dozen bills — including one from Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) requiring Medicaid and Medicare to provide dental, vision and hearing coverage — put forward by Democratic senators as a response to the Trump administration’s efforts to cut federal health care spending.
“We’re all here for those two reasons,” Van Hollen said Thursday at a Capitol Hill news conference to unveil the bills. “One is to shine a light on the great damage and harm the Trump Republican plan will do. But also to put forward some ideas about what we could be doing to actually make health care better for more Americans.”
Van Hollen joined Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, and Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico to unveil the bills.
The Democratic legislation comes at a time when the Senate is deliberating the Republican-backed “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The budget reconciliation bill would implement a number of Trump agenda items, including drastic cuts to Medicaid and other supports that backers say are needed to rein in what they call “waste, fraud and abuse” in those programs.
With a Republican majority in both the Senate and the House, Wyden acknowledged that the Democratic bills have little chance of passage. But, he said, Democrats still hope Republicans will work with them on the legislation and “do the right thing.”
Report: Up to 100,000 Marylanders could lose coverage if Medicaid imposes work requirements

Democrats and health care advocates say the budget reconciliation bill would create more administrative hurdles for Medicaid recipients and will result in millions of people losing coverage, even if they would be eligible for the joint state-federal health care program.
“It’s ‘beautiful’ if you’re a billionaire or a very wealthy person. For everybody else, it’s an ugly mess,” Van Hollen said of the GOP bill. “It comes at the expense of everybody else in America. And that’s especially true when it comes to attacking health care … In fact, it will kick 16 million Americans off their health insurance plans.”
He said his bill, modeled after Maryland’s “Easy Enrollment” program, would do the opposite.
In Maryland, Easy Enrollment lets people check a box on their state tax forms to allow the state to use information on the return to see if their household qualifies for Medicaid. Those who qualify then get further information on what options they qualify for, reducing administrative hurdles to Medicaid and other programs in Maryland.
“What we should do is make it easier for eligible individuals to get the Medicaid that they are eligible for,” Van Hollen said.
This is the second time he has introduced the bill in Congress. A version introduced in the last Congress never even got a committee hearing.
The other Democrats at the press conference offered their own bills to strengthen Medicaid.
Cortez Masto’s bill would increase funding for health care fraud investigation units to help catch more waste, fraud, and abuse in the system. She says that is more productive than just cutting funds to Medicaid.
Luján is sponsoring a bill to temporarily expand federal funding to Medicaid programs for home- and community-based services that help support people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
Wyden also highlighted his own legislation to address hospital labor and delivery unit closures by supporting rural hospitals with additional Medicaid dollars.
“Fact of the matter is that Democrats want to make it easier for Americans to get health care, rather than put people who desperately need health care through bureaucratic water torture if they’re going to get the health care they need,” Wyden said.

These images are painful to witness —parents in fear, children in distress, communities on edge. Behind these protests lies a deep and growing anxiety that families will be torn apart —not because they pose a threat to public safety, but because Congress continues to fail in its duty to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

To be clear: I do not condone violence, looting, or civil unrest. But I cannot look away from the anguish that drives these protests. These are families, neighbors, and workers —human beings— who are watching their lives unravel while political leaders in Washington continue to stall.
Reports from across the country are alarming. Word is spreading that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are detaining Latino workers with little regard for citizenship status. Some unverified accounts have alleged that children were restrained during enforcement actions, further fueling community outrage. 
Here in Connecticut, for example, a high school senior was detained just days before graduation. These are not isolated incidents —they’re signs of a national immigration system that’s broken, blind to justice, and devastating to families. These are not members of violent gangs like the Tren de Aragua; these are individuals trying to survive, provide, and contribute.
What’s perhaps even more troubling is the erosion of due process. Consider the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia —wrongfully deported to El Salvador and only recently returned after a U.S. Supreme Court decision found the government had made a grave error. Regardless of the charges he faced, he was denied the most basic protection: his day in court. Our Constitution guarantees the presumption of innocence, and it applies to everyone under our laws, regardless of immigration status.
We are watching in real time as constitutional protections are weakened —not for theoretical reasons, but in ways that destroy real lives. Alarmingly, the federal administration has now deployed U.S. Marines to patrol Los Angeles neighborhoods, despite no request from California’s governor.  This feels like an overreach of federal power, signaling a disturbing disregard for state authority and civilian life.
Even voices within the president’s own political party are raising concerns. Florida State Sen. Ileana Garcia, co-founder of Latinas for Trump, recently called these immigration enforcement actions “inhumane.” That tells us something important: this is not about partisanship—it’s about humanity.
The Latino community is watching all of this closely. We are frustrated. We are afraid. And we are tired of being the ones who bear the brunt of a chaotic and unjust immigration system. We need solutions —not militarization. We need reform —not fear. And above all, we need our voices heard.
Nonviolent, peaceful protest remains a powerful and necessary tool in our democracy. It’s time we use it to say, clearly and without apology: enough is enough. We cannot continue to allow families to be collateral damage in a policy failure that Congress has refused to fix for decades. 
Let us raise our voices not only in protest, but in purpose —calling for real immigration reform that respects human dignity, protects due process, and restores faith in our system of laws.
History will judge how we responded to this moment. Let’s make sure we responded with integrity and humanity.

In only a few years, the Nazis rose by enflaming people with lies and hatred.  They intimidated their opposition to trample the fledgling democratic norms of the Weimar Republic on their goose-stepping march to rule, with Hitler as the legally appointed Chancellor on January 30, 1933. 
Der Führer promptly eviscerated the legislature, cowed or ignored the judges, and replaced the government apparatus with his own henchmen.  On March 22, only 51 days later, the first transports loaded with his political rivals, now prisoners of the Reich, rolled through the gates of Dachau.
Over the years, I asked myself what would I have done to stop this decline from democracy into history’s most catastrophic dictatorship and all the horrors that followed?  No matter the peril, I hoped I and enough others would have had the courage to stand in front of the gates of that first concentration camp to say, “This shall not pass.  I resist.”
Given the events of the past few years and especially since this January 20, can there be any doubt we face the same moral and political challenge?  
What are we, what am I, willing to do to prevent this current assault on our democracy, this descent into fascism mirroring those critical days of the early 1930s?  We don’t have to be passive.  Maybe speak out, text, write about, what is so plainly happening. Maybe join an organization like ACLU or Build the Resistance/50501, standing up to the would-be dictator.  Maybe march in protest or just stand silent vigil saying “…not on my watch.”
But, let it be something.  We must ensure when future generations look back on these trying times, they see how we, people committed to democracy and the rule of law, stood before the gates of looming autocratic fascism and said, “This shall not pass.  I RESIST.”
And that in this moment in history, different from 1930 German, we, the people, won.

Ned Lamont has set ambitious goals for expanding rail service, yet activity on the Berkshire Line remains dormant.","Imagine yourself on a sunny cruise through the Berkshire Mountains.
Autumn colors explode outside your window as you sip your pumpkin spice latte. Now, imagine your hands off the wheel, no red lights, and no careless drivers weaving across the lanes. Just you, Mr. or Ms. Leaf-Peeper, riding a noiseless zephyr through ecstatic natural beauty.
Every autumn, thousands of daytrippers flock to the Berkshire Mountains in Massachusetts and their foothills in northwestern Connecticut. These visitors bring a welcome cash infusion into local economies, but also irritating traffic and expensive road wear. Additionally, high housing costs and clogged commuter thruways regardless of the season are issues on both sides of the border. 
It is in the best interest of these two states to consider expanding alternative modes of transportation into and through this valuable region to turbocharge economic growth while improving quality of life for residents.
The tools to do this lie at our feet. A railroad, known as the Berkshire Line, connects Danbury and Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The Berkshire Line served passengers until the 1970’s when, after car-centered development became the norm, rail services disintegrated. Today the route is owned by the Housatonic Railroad Company and only serves the occasional freight locomotive. In the towns of New Milford, Kent, Cornwall, and Canaan, passenger stations along the route have been repurposed into shops, chambers of commerce, or lie abandoned.
Connecticut now needs to commit to restoring passenger rail service on the Berkshire Line. Massachusetts has already conducted the studies, bought the tracks, and made the requisite improvements. Millions have been spent, but the line remains inactive. Why? Because without coinciding action on Connecticut’s share of the tracks, the line cannot operate at a capacity necessary to justify service. Gov. Ned Lamont has set ambitious goals for expanding rail service across the Nutmeg State, yet activity on the Berkshire Line remains dormant.


This inaction leaves Massachusetts stuck with the bill for an incomplete project, tourist dollars choked off from business owners, and no forthcoming solutions to northwestern Connecticut’s existing transportation and housing challenges. In some cases, state legislators are proposing anti-solutions, programs that drain coffers while improving nothing, like adding more lanes to our highways. The state would be better served by just setting a giant pile of money on fire. This is a simpler way to waste taxpayer dollars and increase carbon emissions while doing nothing to ease traffic or home costs.
A multifaceted solution to the issues facing Connecticut is to coordinate with local zoning boards to facilitate transit-oriented development (TOD) in areas adjacent to reactivated Berkshire Line passenger stations. This would help address statewide issues of housing costs while at the same time reducing taxpayers’ burden for the line’s operation. Presently, Connecticut is facing an artificial housing shortage due to outdated zoning codes that emphasize low-density sprawl. This nanny-state interference elevates home costs and entrenches automobile reliance. 
By reactivating passenger service along the Berkshire Line and rezoning around stations to allow for mixed-use development of moderate density (think Bedford Falls, not the Bronx) we can create a transportation artery that links hubs of pedestrian-friendly centers of cultural enrichment.
The reactivation of the Berkshire Line isn’t just about creating adorable, Rockwellian hamlets for tourists to admire, it’s also about economic stimulation and meeting the needs of our regional community. Hundreds of commuters drive from towns like Kent or Canaan into Danbury every day. These essential workers end up stuck in traffic on insufficient roads that are easily clogged. Restoring passenger service to the Berkshire Line will ease access to the region for visitors but also make transportation for existing residents more pleasant.
Litchfield County residents may hear “transit oriented development” and want to run for the (rolling, verdant) hills, but reactivating passenger service on the Berkshire Line and rezoning for common-sense density around stations will benefit everyone. By expanding rail access into the region, we can increase revenues for local communities.
 By reasonably upzoning areas adjacent to stations, we can defray tax burdens for local residents, increase the state’s desperately needed housing stock, and create a self-sustaining ridership base for the line. All of this reduces traffic on local roads and costs of maintenance for the same. When we restore passenger service to the Berkshire Line and rezone for transit-oriented development, commuters win, taxpayers win, tourists win, and residents win.

I grew up in Tanana, Alaska, spending summers fishing the Yukon River at Rampart Rapids with my family and our 20 to 30 sled dogs. Salmon wasn’t just food: It was our life. It fed our families and our dogs, who were not only companions but essential workers and transportation in a vast, roadless region.
In the 1990s, when I was a kid, king and chum salmon were abundant. Families used fish wheels and set nets — sustainable methods passed down for generations.
Today, that way of life is vanishing.
King salmon runs have collapsed. A once-iconic symbol of Alaska is disappearing. Just last month, Alaska Airlines suspended its ceremonial red carpet fly-out of the first Copper River king salmon of the season — a clear sign of a deeper crisis already felt in coastal and river communities.
Chum salmon, the lifeblood of rural dog teams, are also disappearing. When I was young, Tanana had more than twice as many sled dogs as people, with upwards of 500 dogs in the village. Today, there are exactly 19. Not because people stopped caring, but because there simply aren’t enough fish to feed them.
Flying in commercial dog food is cost-prohibitive. A 32-pound bag of mid-grade food costs about $85, including freight, and feeds a 20-dog team for just three days in the off-season.
Despite efforts to rehome sled dogs to less remote areas, the heartbreaking reality is that when the chum runs fail, many dogs must be put down. And with them goes a deep part of Alaska’s heritage — our independence, culture and a subsistence way of life.
As a teenager, I worked with Stan Zuray, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to collect data that confirmed what fishermen already knew: King salmon were getting smaller and the runs weaker. Despite clear warnings, meaningful protections came too late.
Now, an even greater threat looms offshore.
Industrial trawlers in the Bering Sea are devastating salmon stocks. Every year, tens of thousands of king and chum salmon are unintentionally caught and discarded as bycatch — hauled up and tossed overboard, dead.
Even worse, these factory trawlers are stripping the ocean of forage fish essential to the food chain, species like herring, capelin, and especially pollock. Around 3 billion pounds of pollock are removed from the Bering Sea annually. Pollock aren’t just a product for fast food; they’re a cornerstone of the marine ecosystem, feeding salmon, seabirds, marine mammals, and more. Without them, the entire food web begins to unravel.
While small communities bear the burden of conservation — sacrificing their fisheries, their food security, and their culture — massive industrial fleets continue to harvest low-value fish for fast-food sandwiches and imitation crab.
If this story sounds familiar, it should. Look at the Columbia River: once home to legendary salmon runs, now a cautionary tale of habitat destruction, overfishing and mismanagement. Billions of dollars have been spent trying to restore Columbia River salmon and they are still failing. The truth is once wild salmon runs collapse, they rarely, if ever, come back.
The Yukon could be next.
The upper Yukon has now been closed to Chinook harvest for five years, with a seven-year moratorium set to extend that to 12. That’s 12 consecutive years on one of the most iconic and remote rivers on earth without a single legally harvested Chinook salmon. Entire generations are growing up without the traditions that once defined life on the river.
The science isn’t in dispute. Warming ocean temperatures and rising disease rates like ichthyophonus are making things worse. But industrial trawling is an immediate, human-caused crisis—and one we can do something about.
Once wild salmon runs are gone, they’re gone.
Once cultural knowledge is lost, it doesn’t return.
Once a way of life tied to the river disappears, it’s gone forever.
This isn’t just an environmental crisis. It’s cultural erasure, unfolding in real time.
Alaska’s wild salmon are iconic but they are not invincible. Without immediate, bold action to rein in the destruction caused by industrial trawlers, the future of wild salmon and the people who rely on them will be lost.
We can’t afford another decade of excuses. The time to act is now.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)A budget plan is taking shape and the clock is ticking.
Maine Morning Star will have regular updates as the committee tasked with setting that plan, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, takes straw votes on what to include ahead of a final vote on the budget proposal to be sent to the Maine Senate and House of Representatives for consideration.
Legislative leaders have said the intention is to complete all work by June 18, what had been the statutory adjournment date for the first regular session. Though, the Legislature is now in a special session, without a formal deadline.
In March, the Democratic majority pushed through a roughly $11.3 billion, two-year budget plan without Republican support and formally adjourned in order to start the clock for those funds to become available in 90 days. 
Senate Republicans refused to back an alternative short-term plan that would have immediately filled the current deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, because it did not include structural reform to the program.
The budget that did pass continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing one-time funding for MaineCare and other urgent needs. But it didn’t include any of the policy changes Gov. Janet Mills proposed, such as tax increases and program cuts, to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
These proposals and others from lawmakers are now being weighed by the appropriations committee as it crafts the next iteration of the budget.

Adding streaming tax, upping cannabis tax and continuing free community college


By: Emma Davis - Thursday June 12, 2025 10:23 pm


















Returning on microphone after 9 p.m. Thursday night, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee voted to include several additional taxes proposed by Gov. Janet Mills in the budget, including a tax on streaming services and increasing the sales tax on cannabis. However, the committee included a smaller amount than the governor suggested to continue funding free community college. 
The committee voted 7-4 to include Mills’ proposed new 5.5% tax on streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. 
The committee also voted 8-4 to increase the sales tax on adult use cannabis from 10% to 14%, while reducing the cannabis excise tax rates by one-third. This was not a party-line vote. Rep. Kristen Cloutier (D-Lewiston), who co-chairs the Taxation Committee, said she was not in favor of this initiative.
“I’ve been in contact with some folks who are in the cannabis industry in my district and they have really advocated loudly against this,” Cloutier said. 
With these decisions made, the committee has now decided on what to include, and not include, out of Mills’ major tax proposals. 
In addition to the streaming and cannabis taxes, earlier Thursday the committee rolled back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes and increased the cigarette excise tax at an even higher amount than Mills requested. However, the committee rejected her suggested taxes on ambulances and pharmacies.
Most debate surrounded including funding to continue Maine’s Free College Scholarship, which the committee decided to fund but at a reduced amount. 
Rather than include the $12.5 million per year sought by the governor, the committee voted 9-3 to fund the program at $10 million per year through the next biennium. 
“We’ve had to make hard decisions about what we think we can afford, not afford, and we’re supportive but we believe that they’ll be able to address a need with $10 million a year,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.
However, to help guide decisions about continuing the program beyond that, the committee will be writing a letter to the community colleges requesting recommendations on eligibility requirements, out-of-state student funding, economy of scale and estimated future funding. 
“We had promised nights that would not be long,” committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said at 10:10 p.m. “We have just a little bit to finish up, but we will do that in the morning.” The committee is scheduled to reconvene at 9 a.m.

Budget gets bump from a “large and unusual” payment


By: Emma Davis -  5:33 pm


















The Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee announced Thursday afternoon the state has come into more cash that can be added to the budget. The additional funds are from some state agencies seeing unexpected surpluses this fiscal year. It also comes from two significant estate payments.
The majority of the committee moved all of this funding into the budget plan with 8-4 votes. 
Since the most recent revenue forecast in May, Maine received two “large and unusual” estate payments, Kirsten Figueroa, commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, told the appropriations committee Thursday afternoon. This now puts the estate tax line well above what was initially expected.
“Does that mean two people passed and this is where this money came from?” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) asked.
“I do,” Figueroa responded.  
The way this funding, $24 million, will be added to the budget is also unusual, because technically the money isn’t real until the fiscal year ends on June 30. But ultimately it will be used to pay for part of the $122 million in MaineCare funding for fiscal year 2027 that the committee voted into the budget on Wednesday. 
The majority of the committee also voted into the budget millions of dollars that various departments are not planning to use up by the end of the fiscal year. Among those funds are $4.5 million from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Behavioral Health and $5 million from the Office of Disability Services.
“I would rather keep the money in the account and have it be used for what it should be used for, rather than going to the general fund, which by going into the general fund, is essentially funding MaineCare,” Fredette said.

Committee saves money by rolling back funding for mental health programs, pensions


By: Emma Davis -  12:27 pm


















While not sticking to its stated start time, the appropriations committee returned Thursday morning to take more straw votes to work toward a complete budget plan. The committee plans to return throughout the day for more votes.
Mental health
Following the deadliest mass shooting in Maine history in 2023, the state put significant resources into bolstering mental health support. However, faced with the current deficit, the appropriations committee opted to reduce some of those programs.
On Tuesday, the committee approved funding for crisis receiving centers in Penobscot and Androscoggin counties but on Thursday voted out money for these centers in Kennebec and Aroostook counties.
In the supplemental budget last year, the governor signed into law funding to develop these crisis receiving centers following the Lewiston shooting. When presenting her two-year budget plan back in January, Mills argued it was not financially feasible to build all of the centers she had hoped. 
Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison raised concern about walking back on these commitments and said the centers were a point of rare bipartisan agreement last year, though the overall budget was passed mostly along party lines with Democrats in favor. 
“As someone who actually voted for the funding for this in the previous budget, this is a difficult cut for me to accept,” said committee co-chair Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook). 
Regarding Aroostook County in particular, Gattine said he spoke with the Department of Health and Human Services, whose representatives think that this specific model might not be the best for that rural area, so they may suggest an alternative crisis model in the future. 
The committee also removed funding for 24 mental health law enforcement liaisons to support mental health crisis intervention, and mobile response services.
The majority of the appropriations committee also voted to make cuts to various mental health services.
The committee voted 7-5 to provide county jails $4 million for medication assisted treatment to address drug dependency in fiscal year 2026, but did not include funding for the following year, which Gattine explained could be revisited in a supplemental budget next year. The committee also reduced funding for employee recruitment and retention of staff that provide medication management services within the Office of Behavioral Health.
Mills proposed a number of reductions to the overall state budget, focusing on new programs  that had not yet been fully started. While Gattine again reiterated the cuts are not something he takes lightly, he said, “I really came back to the fact that the baseline of MaineCare, everything that we have funded, provides millions and billions of dollars of support for behavioral health needs. I don’t think we support those needs enough. I’m hoping we can continue to do things to support the needs of people with behavioral health needs.”
Pensions 
Another area where the majority of the committee proposed to save money is rolling back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes.
The committee voted 8-5 to incorporate Mills’ proposal to phase-out a current deduction offered for nonmilitary pensions, though changed the thresholds. 
Mills proposed a phase-out beginning with income over $100,000 for individuals, $150,000 for heads of households and $200,000 for married individuals filing jointly. But the committee backed phase outs starting at $125,000 for individuals, $187,500 for heads of household, and $250,000 for joint filers. 
“The money that we’re taking belongs to them,” Rep. Mark Blier (R-Buxton) said in protest. “It doesn’t belong to us.”
Paid Family and Medical Leave 
The committee voted 7-5 to include funding the governor proposed to help cover the costs of the community college system, Maine Maritime Academy and the University of Maine System for the state-supported positions related to the new Paid Family and Medical Leave Program, which took effect on Jan. 1. 
However, the committee reduced the allocations Mills suggested for the university system, which Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, said it was because the system negotiated with a company that is allowing them to get premiums to cover some of the cost. 
Amid the voting, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) wanted to specify that this is one-time funding to cover the initial cost of the paid family leave program, after Republicans raised concerns about the state being on the hook. The committee ultimately incorporated that note.
“So you are going to take the lollipop away from the baby,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “I’m anxious to see that. Thank you.”
Additional decisions
The majority of the committee also approved an increase from $5 to $7 for fishing license fees. 
Also, following the request of the Legislative Council, which is made up of the ten elected members of leadership, the committee agreed to incorporate several temporary legislative positions, though did not go so far as to make them permanent.

Increased cigarette tax, rejected child care cuts, funded MaineCare


By: Emma Davis - Wednesday June 11, 2025 10:50 pm


















The budget took more of a shape Wednesday night, though, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said, “we are determined to get this budget done in the daylight,” so the committee is reconvening at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. 
Substantial decisions were made Wednesday night when the committee reconvened, including increasing Maine’s cigarette tax more than Gov. Janet Mills’ had proposed, rejecting Mills’ proposed cuts to child care worker stipends and Head Start, and adding funding for MaineCare. 
When Mills first proposed her budget in January, a key component she highlighted to address the deficit was her plan to raise revenue through a $1 increase in the cigarette excise tax — from $2 per pack to $3 — and corresponding increases to the excise tax on other tobacco-related products.
The majority of the appropriations committee voted 8-4 to increase it by $1.50.
Since Mills released her proposal, Republicans have been steadfast about their opposition to raising this tax, and to tax increases of any kind. On Wednesday those in the minority party on the committee again made that stance clear.
“I was shocked when the governor came out with the original proposed tax increase on the cigarettes of a buck,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said, “and now to throw it up to a buck and a half. I see in my opinion, with all due respect to everyone around this horseshoe, a lack of ability to make tough decisions on where we’re going to spend money in this state.”
When Mills presented her proposal back in January, she touted it as a way to help generate revenue while simultaneously reducing public health costs in the long-term by disincentivizing people to smoke. Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln) highlighted that goal in voicing her support for upping the tax, stating that her stepfather recently died of cancer caused by cigarettes.
But Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester) countered, “I don’t feel like it’s responsible to base our budget on revenue that we hope will go down.”
The majority of the committee, voting 7-5, subsequently approved about $122 million for MaineCare, filling a gap left in the initial two-year budget passed in March that did not include MaineCare funding for the second year of the biennium. 
“I do believe we should pay our bills, but we also had reforms to hopefully reduce that amount that we’re paying,” Arata said, referring to proposals to implement work requirements and other reforms to the program that failed to be included in the supplemental budget for the current fiscal year. “Therefore, I can’t support this motion.”  
The majority almost entirely rejected the governor’s proposed cuts related to child care programs, with one exception. 
Voting 7-5 again, the committee removed from the budget plan Mills’ proposal to reverse the state’s recent investments in child care by reducing worker stipends by $30 million to bring them back to 2022 levels. With the same vote breakdown, the committee also rejected Mills’ proposal to cut funding for Head Start by $7 million. 
That same majority also rejected a proposed $2.5 million cut in fiscal year 2026 to the child care employment award program, which includes child care staff in the Maine Child Care affordability program, however the committee chose to remove funding for the award program in 2027. 
“This was styled as a two-year pilot program, so our intent is to continue the pilot program in 2026, not provide funding for it in fiscal year 2027 at this time,” said Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “We’ll have a chance to evaluate that next year when we reconvene.”  
Although a budget-neutral move, one decision Wednesday night received praise from Republicans. 
Mills proposed elevating the current Governor’s Energy Office to a cabinet-level department in her budget plan but the committee removed that change Wednesday, in light of a separate bill moving through the Legislature that seeks to do that. 
“I appreciate the fact that we are letting this kind of an initiative be debated as it should be in the policy committees and brought to the floor for a vote,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison.

Preserving Maine State Grant Program


By: Emma Davis -  3:58 pm


















Wednesday morning the appropriations committee made a number of reductions to the governor’s proposed funding for various departments. Returning briefly just after 3 p.m., the majority of its members chose to again reject a proposal from Mills, following requests from private higher education institutions. 
Currently, all Maine public and private universities, colleges and technical schools that administer federal financial aid, such as the Pell Grant and Direct Loans, are eligible for something called the Maine State Grant Program, which provides need-based assistance.
The governor proposed cutting Maine’s private colleges from the program, which educators and students pushed back on during the public hearing. The Education and Cultural Affairs Committee also requested the change be rejected. The appropriations committee followed suit Wednesday voting the change out of the plan 8-2. 
“Stay tuned,” appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said after the afternoon votes. “We will be back later. I’m not quite sure when but we will be back.”

Mobile home program funded while judiciary requests pared down


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 10, 2025 6:50 pm


















Indicative of the lack of sleep and long hours legislators are working, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) accidentally called a vote as unanimous as the committee met while the Senate was still in session Tuesday afternoon. 
The mishap was met with laughs as it was bookended by votes on a number of items — none of which were unanimous. 
The majority of the committee backed one-time funding — a transfer of $3 million from the unappropriated surplus of the general fund to the Maine State Housing Authority — for the manufactured and mobile home park preservation and assistance program. This was a request in a bill that passed the chambers but was placed on the appropriations table. 
There are currently more than 100 bills on this table, which is managed by the appropriations committee. Bills that cost money that hasn’t already been allocated are placed here to vie for remaining unappropriated funding — or, as evidenced by this case, could instead be included in the budget plan. 
After the committee sets the budget, one of its final acts will be to “run the table” and decide which of the remaining bills will receive funds.
Other items added into the plan include one-time funding to upgrade courtrooms with video conferencing technology. However, the committee also moved out numerous other proposals related to the judiciary, such as funding for new positions, resources and ​​increasing the number of jurors called to jury duty.
“I think we’re shortchanging the judiciary,” said Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport). 
Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee, said he believed many of the items the committee ultimately voted out were important. 
“I think by the time we’re done here, there will be over $20 million in new funding approved for them, and I hope the process is that they’re able to come back and we’re able to do more for them over time,” Gattine said.

A move to maximize federal match for free school meals


By: Emma Davis -  11:34 am


















Amid chamber work Tuesday morning, the majority of the Appropriations Committee voted in favor of a change aimed to maximize federal dollars for free school lunches in order to save the state an expected $2 million. 
After the COVID-19 pandemic, Maine became one of a handful of states to pass legislation making school meals free.
“[That] took away that stigma and took away that paperwork that was associated with individual families and individual students, so now everybody in the school district does qualify,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. “But we do have some school districts that have not enrolled in the program, so we’re not able to maximize the federal funding that’s available.”
After the committee voted to pay the difference between the federal reimbursement and full price of meals for schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program, Brennan introduced an amendment to require that in order for schools to get this state funding they must first enroll in the free meal program in a way that makes them eligible for the maximum money available at the federal level. The committee approved the change with a 9-2 straw vote. 
Much of the committee’s work has been approving, or rejecting, a number of state government positions. Republicans have continued to raise objections to expanding state government personnel. 
“I think one thing we can agree on is that it’s all a balance,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “And, maybe we balance things in different places, but finding the right balance is part of what this is all about.”

Another of Gov. Mills’ proposed taxes removed from plan


By: Emma Davis - Monday June 9, 2025 4:53 pm


















Monday morning at the State House began with more talk about taxes as the Appropriations Committee continued its line-by-lines votes on what to include in the budget. 
The majority of the committee voted to remove Mills’ proposed tax on ambulance services, which is one of several tax increases the governor proposed as a means to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
The tax on non-municipal ambulance service providers would have been equal to 6% of their net operating revenue, which the Mills administration said it would have used to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements.
While Republicans on the committee said they supported removing the tax — as the minority party has made clear it will not support tax increases of any kind — they questioned how the state will deal with those shortfalls and pay for additional spending the committee has approved. 
One example from Monday was reallocating the cost of an emergency coordinator position that is partially funded through federal expenditures to being completely supported by the general fund. 
“We’re moving positions and costs into the general fund, and my only question is, where is that money coming from?” Sen. Sue Bernard (R-Aroostook) asked. “Is it coming from more tax increases? Is it coming from cutting other programs that we haven’t gotten to yet, or what?”
Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin), who co-chairs the committee, responded, “As we build this budget, we will take care of that in one way or another so that the budget will balance at the end.” 
It is not yet clear whether the committee will support some of Mills’ other proposed taxes or the cuts she proposed to health and child care programs. So far, the committee also voted out a proposed pharmacy tax. 
Implications from federal funding cuts were also top of mind. 
The coordinator position was one of several that the committee readjusted to be more reliant on state funding, though Mills made those recommendations before President Donald Trump’s administration began rescinding congressionally appropriated funds. 
“We have talked about the fact that if federal funds disappear, positions disappear,” Rotundo said. 
But some concerns about federal funding predated Trump’s second term. During the public hearing for the budget bill, the Maine Emergency Management Agency said budget deficits related to federal funding had already resulted in the agency leaving two positions vacant. 
The committee voted to fund two positions fully with the general fund, after they’d previously been supported solely by federal dollars. 
“It was important to make sure that these positions were preserved and that it was worth the investment in additional general fund dollars,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), the other co-chair of the committee.

With less than two weeks left, lawmakers still debating budget plan


By: Emma Davis -  4:51 pm


















During the committee’s last meeting on Thursday, the majority of its members rejected a tax on Maine pharmacies the governor had proposed, while voting in favor of additional funding and rate reform for nursing homes. 
The pharmacy tax would have imposed a 70-cent tax on every outpatient prescription filled by Maine pharmacies, the revenue from which the Mills administration said it would use to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements. 
“I haven’t voted for any items,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison on Thursday. “Yet, this will be my first, because I believe that we already collect too much taxes.” 
With a 10-2 vote, other Republicans backed removing the tax too, though the holdouts noted that their opposition was because of a lack of clarity about the overall budget plan. 
“I applaud the work of the majority in terms of removing this,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “However, I will be consistent in reviewing the overall global budget in determining whether or not I will support it.” 
That sentiment was also shared ahead of the committee voting 9-3 in favor of $20 million in additional funding for nursing homes over the biennium. This includes a $6.5 million investment for rate reform to support the direct care workforce and incentivize permanent staff, which would in turn unlock $12.2 million in funding from the federal government. 
“Nursing home rate reform is very important to us, however at this particular time we have not had a discussion about where additional general funds come from that we’re going to need,” Ducharme said. “In order for me to support this, even though I would historically support something like this, I want to know where the money’s coming from.”
Other Republicans had a different take. While Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata of New Gloucester would also like to know where the funds are coming from, “I feel right about supporting this,” she said. “I might not support the entire package, but I feel better knowing that this is in there, ultimately.”

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)Despite pressure from the Trump administration to repeal protections for transgender student athletes, lawmakers in the Maine Senate late Thursday rejected legislation that would restrict transgender students’ access to school sports and bathrooms.
The majority of the chamber also shot down an effort to roll back state law that establishes a process for someone at least 16 years old to access gender-affirming health care.
The bills —  LD 1134 and LD 380 — mark the first of several targeting transgender rights that will go before lawmakers in the Maine Senate and House of Representatives in the coming days.
LD 1134 would specifically ban transgender girls from playing girls sports or using girls bathrooms or locker rooms. It is one of three similar proposals this session that require trans students to adhere to sports and facilities that align with the sex assigned at birth.
The Senate voted 21-14 in support of a motion to reject the measure, with Sen. Rick Bennett of (R-Oxford) joining Democrats against the bill.
In a speech on the Senate floor, Bennett commended the students who spoke up on “every side of the issue.” 
Transgender teens and allies crowd State House to fight anti-trans bills

“These are Maine kids and they deserve to grow up in a state where they are safe, respected and seen,” he said.
Referring to those who say the bill seeks to put the state in compliance with federal anti-discrimination protections, he said those questions are “already being addressed in courts where they belong. What we are being asked today is something different: deciding if our laws will affirm the dignity of every child in Maine, or diminish it.”
Many of the bill’s critics focused on what they said were inherent biological differences between males and females and the superior athleticism of males.
Bill sponsor Sen. Sue Bernard (R-Aroostook) told her colleagues she meant no disrespect to the trans community with the bill. 
“I’m merely recognizing biological strengths and differences that exist,” she said. “It’s also what’s inherently fair and unfair about requiring girls to compete against trans athletes. There’s nothing new about leveling the playing field in sports.”
Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot), however, pointed out that trans women and girls have been competing alongside cisgender girls in sports in Maine for decades without much fanfare. “This is nothing new,” he said. “What is new is the outsized and disproportionate focus on their lives, especially on what trans kids get to do at school.”
He continued, “Banning a group of kids from playing sports alongside their classmates simply because of who they are is not about ensuring fairness. It’s about drawing a line of exclusion. And for trans youth, who already face significantly higher rates of bullying, depression and suicide, being told they don’t belong will have serious consequences for their health and their well being.”
The Senate also voted 21-14 against LD 380, which would no longer allow minors that are at least 16 years old to consent to gender-affirming care, which can include a wide range of services, including hormone therapy and counseling.
Debate centers on fairness and safety during hearing on transgender sports bills

Sen. David Haggan (R-Penobscot), who sponsored the legislation, said parents should know what children are doing, “in all facets of life,” until they are 18 years old. 
Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) said the current law was passed after “exhaustive study and debate in the 131st Legislature. There’s no reason to change.”
Hundreds of people attended the May public hearing on the slate of anti-trans bills, the vast majority of whom were there in support of trans students. Citing national attacks on trans rights, students, parents of trans youth, faith leaders, educators and other community members testified against the proposals.
In 2021, the Maine Human Rights Act was amended to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. But that policy has been the subject of debate and scrutiny since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. The U.S. Department of Justice is currently suing the state over what it says are violations of Title IX, which protects against discrimination in schools. 
Other legislation expected to appear before the House and Senate include proposals to restrict the rights of students to use affirming pronouns and broader bills attempting to remove gender identity as part of the Maine Human Rights Act.

Mike Dunleavy vetoed more than $122 million from Alaska’s annual budget plan before signing it into law Thursday.
The governor’s vetoes fell heaviest on education, as Dunleavy eliminated more than $50 million from the state’s per-student education funding formula and tens of millions intended for school maintenance. 
It’s the first time in state history that a governor has failed to fully fund the education formula, a precedent-breaking act akin to former Gov. Bill Walker’s decision in 2016 to veto part of the Permanent Fund dividend, which until then had been decided by a previously sacrosanct formula.
Dunleavy also vetoed budget language designed to prevent excess spending from the state’s Higher Education Investment Fund, which is ordinarily intended to pay for high school students’ scholarships. The governor chose to take money from the fund rather than the reserves of the state’s investment bank, the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority.
The governor announced his vetoes without a news conference or lengthy statement, instead releasing a prerecorded video earlier on Thursday stating that the vetoes, which cover both the state’s annual operating budget bill and the capital budget bill, were required by the state’s fiscal situation.
Oil prices have fallen significantly over the past year, leading to dwindling state revenue. The governor’s vetoes relied on a new state revenue forecast unavailable to lawmakers when they drafted the budget.

(George Frey/Getty Images)A low heat that’s simmered for weeks over an attempt to lower prescription drug prices in Louisiana increased to a boil Thursday in the waning hours of the state legislative session, with Gov. Jeff Landry saying he will bring lawmakers back to Baton Rouge to address prescription drug policy. 
The eight-week regular session ended with lawmakers backing the less stringent of two measures aimed at regulating pharmacy benefit managers, often referred to as PBMs or “middlemen” that oversee prescription drug programs for insurance companies and large employers.  
PBMs have faced increasing criticism from patient advocate groups who blame them for high medication prices, while independent drugstore owners say they unfairly favor large corporate pharmacies. Some of the country’s largest pharmacy chains, including CVS, also operate a PBM, which critics have said leads fewer pharmacy and medication options for consumers. 
Landry wanted lawmakers to pass a  more aggressive bill that would have prohibited companies from owning drug stores and pharmacy benefit managers, which would have threatened companies such as CVS who own both. The Senate declined to bring House Bill 358, by Rep. Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas, up for a final vote, however, allowing it to die before the legislative session ended. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Instead, the legislature passed what had been seen as a compromise between the corporate chains and independent pharmacists in House Bill 264, by Rep. Mike Echols, R-Monroe. The bill requires PBMs to be more transparent about their practices with state regulators and to pass more prescription savings on to consumers.  

The Senate also hastily drafted and approved a resolution instructing the Louisiana Department of Health to study the impact of banning PBMs from also owning pharmacies and to produce a report on the subject ahead of the legislature’s 2026 regulation session next March. 
,Landry was upset the lawmakers didn’t go farther, however, and threatened to haul the lawmakers back into session later this summer to pass the same proposal. 
“Yes we will have a special session to lower prescription drugs for our citizens. It’s that important!” Landry said in an email from his spokeswoman Kate Kelly shortly before the bill failed. 
It’s not clear when the governor would call a special session focused on PBMs. Several lawmakers said he was already on his way to France for the International Paris Air Show which starts Monday. He cannot sign off on the paperwork needed for a special session while outside of the state of Louisiana.  

I am committed to lowering drug prices, and I am hopeful our senators are too!
Lowering drug prices for our seniors and all of Louisiana!
If we fail to pass the meaningful first steps that the House passed yesterday, we can come back over the summer to finish it!
— Governor Jeff Landry (@LAGovJeffLandry) June 12, 2025

Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, told reporters after adjournment the complexity of Miller’s bill, along with feedback from stakeholders, led to the decision to back alternative measures. . 
“The more that members had the opportunity to really digest what that bill would do – and the conversations they were having back home with both their local pharmacy, the chain pharmacist, who it was going to affect – we really had a difficult time getting a true grasp of what the bill was going to do,” Henry said. 
The Senate president said opposition from senators to the Miller bill grew over the day Thursday as more constituents and lobbyists reached out to members. He also said a special session on PBM legislation seems unnecessary because the Landry-backed bill wasn’t even supposed to get implemented for another two years. 

“I don’t know why you would call a special session for a bill that doesn’t take effect until 2027,” Henry said. 
Arkansas approved a law similar to the Miller bill earlier this year and currently faces federal lawsuits from two of the country’s largest pharmacy benefit managers. Henry expressed reluctance to follow their lead.  
The Miller proposal drew strong opposition from a plaintiff in one of the Arkansas cases – CVS, which owns the pharmacy benefit manager CVS Caremark. Its campaign to defeat the bill included sending text messages to thousands of members of the public, including state employees and their families Thursday, which led the governor to direct Attorney General Liz Murrill to investigate the company’s actions.
CVS Caremark contracts with the state Office of Group Benefits for billions of dollars to manage insurance coverage for state employees and retirees.   
“This is not an appropriate use of personal information obtained through a state contract.” Murrill said Thursday morning in a news release. 
CVS had said the Miller bill would force it to close more than 125 stores in Louisiana, leading 2,700 employees to lose their jobs. 
“Closing drug stores doesn’t lower drug prices. Forcing out 20% of the state’s pharmacies only makes pharmacy deserts worse,” Amy Thibault, CVS executive director of corporate communications, said in an email. 
When Echols made the final pitch for his compromise legislation Thursday in the House, he singled out CVS for criticism, noting he had talked with Murrill about her pursuing charges against the company for violating terms of its state contract when it sent its mass text message to state workers.
“This House is not for sale. This legislature cannot be bullied,” Echols said. 
Randal Johnson, with the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association, said the Echols bill will be a vast improvement over the current PBM regulations in Louisiana. 

“We believe the consumer will have an opportunity to find out what their drugs costs, and the consumer will have the opportunity to have a less expensive cost of medication” under the Echols legislation, Johnson said. 
A special session can last no longer than 30 days, and its subject matter will be limited to what Landry wants to discuss if he decides to call it.

Spencer Cox makes a high bet on nuclear energy, advancing processes to make Utah a nuclear hub, the state announced it is studying to lease military land for an uranium enrichment facility.
Newcomer company Utah Energy is planning to sublease a piece of Camp Williams, located at the south end of Bluffdale, to refine uranium into concentrations to make it a suitable fuel for nuclear reactors. 
That uranium will then be transported by semitrucks to nuclear facilities as needed, Drew DeWalt, a representative from Utah Energy— and also behind other similar projects in other states, including Washington, said at the Thursday announcement hosted by the company, the Utah Department of Natural Resources, the Utah Office of Energy Development, and the Military Installation Development Authority.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
With a push from the White House to accelerate nuclear energy developments, DeWalt said that this processing is going to happen somewhere in the U.S., and odds are it will happen in Utah for its location and its government’s willingness to embrace the resource. But, mostly, what he wanted to convey during the announcement was that the facility should be “safe, necessary and important” for neighboring communities. 
As Cox advances nuclear agreements, he says the cost to develop technology is nothing so far

“This is really a closed-loop system. The major risks are not to the public, but to our employees,” DeWalt said, adding that staff would face standard industrial risks in the project, especially since it would be a process the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would carefully oversee.
This isn’t a done deal. It’s the start of an engagement process that could take years, DeWalt said. The lease proposal will be subject to the review of the Military Installation Development Authority Board and other legislative panels within the next two weeks. 
Ariana Farber, deputy director for the Military Installation Development Authority, said this project is designed similarly to the Falcon Hill Project Area at Hill Air Force Base, which leased federal property for an aerospace research park. 
“The National Guard project area was created to facilitate infrastructure that supports military operations. The project directly contributes to that mission,” Farber said about the uranium processing facility, “and it’s in alignment with our state of Utah energy initiatives from the governor’s office, and also in alignment with our national security posture.”
In combination with other developments, this project will help fund large-scale capital projects for the Utah National Guard, Farber said, including a new aviation facility contemplated in rural southern Utah, an enhanced wildfire response and emergency deployment capabilities.



Let us know what you think...


 


Utah officials who have championed nuclear energy developments, including Cox in a recent op-ed published in the Deseret News, criticized the fact that about 25% of the enriched uranium used in U.S. nuclear reactors comes from Russia. About 70% of all enriched uranium used in the country in 2023 came from other countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
According to DeWalt, the Camp Williams project may solve inefficiencies in the current fuel supply chain, which often requires the transportation of uranium to Europe for processing, since there aren’t enough facilities in the country. 
Now, with a “nuclear renaissance” in sight propelled by President Donald Trump, Utah has been moving fast to implement the technology on its soil — the Legislature already approved a big bill to set up the foundation for nuclear energy and state officials signed a couple of memorandums of understanding with nuclear technology developers. 
That momentum is something DeWalt is hoping to tap into.
“​​How much faster could you do this and still be safe? I think there’s got to be a happy medium where there’s a lot of unnecessary bureaucratic delay,” he said. “Can we strip that out, and can we still be safe?”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Ahead of a day of national protest against the Trump administration’s deportation tactics and deployment of troops to Los Angeles to quell resistance, Pennsylvania leaders and scholars cautioned against allowing anger to set the tone.
“We can’t allow ourselves to be moved by our emotions, because the anger that is being provoked, there’s a reason for it,” Kenneth Nuriddin, resident imam of The Philadelphia Masjid said Thursday. He warned protestors that yielding to violence would distract from their message and justify a violent government response.
America’s immigrant communities have reasons to be angry, Nuriddin, who is the mosque’s spiritual leader, said. He spoke at a news conference Thursday with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner before a planned protest Saturday in the city.
“There’s a promise — give me your tired, your poor — that is in the harbor in New York City, inviting people to come. And many people have come because of that invitation,” Nuriddin said, adding the promise has been broken and the invitation rescinded.
Philadelphia is one of hundreds of cities where a partnership of labor, Democratic and anti-Trump organizations have planned non-violent demonstrations to counter the unprecedented military parade Saturday in Washington, D.C., set to coincide with President Donald Trump’s birthday. 
Krasner vowed to protect the rights of those who protest lawfully in Philadelphia.
“That is our oath,” Krasner said. “But, we will also hold accountable anyone and everyone, whether they are uniformed ICE agents or opportunistic criminals.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Gov. Josh Shapiro emphasized his support of protesters’ First Amendment rights, while issuing his own warning against criminal activity. Shapiro said he’s working with Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker’s office and law enforcement. State and local police  will also be coordinating.
“The right to peacefully protest and exercise our First Amendment is a sacred American right — and here in Pennsylvania, we will always protect it,” Shapiro said.
But he added, “I want to be very clear: all protests and demonstrations must remain peaceful, lawful, and orderly. Violence is not an answer to any political differences. Destruction and chaos are unacceptable — and neither will be permitted here in Pennsylvania.”
Dickinson College President John E. Jones III , who is a retired federal judge, told the Capital-Star he fears Trump’s willingness to use military force to tamp down opposition could lead to a tragedy like the massacre at Kent State in 1970 by Ohio National Guard troops who shot and killed four and wounded nine unarmed student protesters. 
“We’re a military gunshot away from a sort of national crisis,” Jones said, noting that troops are forbidden from carrying out civilian law enforcement in the United States because they’re not trained for it.

“You’re relying on hundreds of troops to hold their fire in the face of hostile activity and maybe even demonstrations that bait them,” Jones said. “It only takes one to fire in a fit of anger or apprehension and we’ve crossed a line that will be very difficult to return from.
Since President Trump took the oath of office for the second time in January, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has conducted raids across the nation.
Such tactics have been standard in other administrations for decades. But those conducted in the last six months have been more aggressive, with agents in unmarked vehicles wearing face coverings targeting workers, foreign students and those with pending immigration cases.
Public outrage over the raids reached a boil in the last week as protesters in Los Angeles clashed with law enforcement and Trump responded by deploying National Guard troops and U.S. Marines into the city. 
And it reached a new crescendo among elected leaders Thursday as California Democratic U.S. Senator Alex Padilla was shoved to the floor and handcuffed by FBI agents after he attempted to ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem questions, while she was holding a news conference in LA.
The FBI said in a statement that Padilla, who interrupted Noem’s formal remarks, was not wearing his Senate security pin, which law enforcement uses to quickly identify lawmakers. But  he was released after being identified.

Padilla’s fellow lawmakers condemned the administration’s treatment of the senator.
“It’s horrible. It is shocking at every level. And it’s not the America I know,” U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) told reporters.
Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman said in a tweet he was sad to see what happened to Padilla, who “deserved much better.”
“We collectively must turn the temperature down and find a better way forward for our nation,” Fetterman’s tweet said.
Pennsylvania U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-2nd District) called videos of the incident “terrible and frightening,” in a tweet.
“If the Trump regime can do this to a sitting United States Senator, then truly no American is safe,” Boyle’s tweet said.
Retired Duquesne University constitutional law professor Bruce Ledewitz told the Capital-Star while the Trump administration’s reaction to Padilla confronting Noem is unfortunate, he described it as “performative fascism.” 
“This is Trump clearly indicating to the executive branch that, ‘We want to look tough. We want to look mean,’” Ledewitz said “He means this to be a performance. He doesn’t mean anyone to get hurt.”
Ledewitz said the incident doesn’t rise to the level of a constitutional crisis, noting that while members of Congress are cloaked with the immunity to liability for their speech and actions in the performance of their duties, the Speech and Debate clause “doesn’t include interrupting press conferences.”

Jones offered the same assessment of Padilla’s Speech and Debate protections.
“In my experience that hasn’t extended to the kind of statements that triggered, literally triggered, FBI agents to push him to the floor and put him in handcuffs,” Jones said.
While Padilla might have a claim under the Fourth Amendment against excessive force he could raise in a civil lawsuit, Jones said he’s doubtful that would be worth the lawmaker’s  effort.
Nonetheless, there was no justification for the reaction to Padilla’s attempt to question Noem, Jones said. He noted that he recently has spoken out against the rhetoric Trump adviser Stephen Miller and others have used to attack judges. 
“Although I would wish for someone high in the administration to make a statement to try to ratchet down the overheated climate, I was fairly certain that would not happen,” Jones said, adding that entreaties like those from Krasner and the clergy who joined him Thursday are unlikely to stop it.
“I think it’s going to be a long, hot summer,” he said.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Nebraska House Republicans joined a GOP majority Thursday in advancing a White House request to claw back $9.4 billion the federal government had already approved for international aid and funding for public media.
The legislation revokes more than $8 billion from several foreign aid programs run by the U.S. State Department or the U.S. Agency for International Development.
It also would rescind all funding Congress approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, totaling $1.1 billion. 
Every vote mattered
It passed the House on a largely party-line vote of 214-212. The proposal now goes to the U.S. Senate, where it needs a simple majority to pass. The Senate would need to act before mid-July to approve the cuts, States Newsroom reported.
The Trump Administration is on track to do what two previous GOP administrations sought to do — strip federal funding for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. 
“For decades, Republicans have promised to cut NPR, but have never done it, until now,” Trump said during the vote on Truth Social. “The Rescissions Bill is a NO BRAINER, and every single Republican in Congress should vote, ‘YES.’ MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
The push is just another step in the White House’s political battle with the media.  Trump and some House GOP members said they are fulfilling their pledge to cut the organizations’ funding. 
U.S. Reps. Adrian Smith, who represents Nebraska’s rural 3rd Congressional District and Mike Flood, who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st District, had telegraphed support for the proposal for days. But Rep. Don Bacon, who represents the Omaha-based 2nd District, had told the New York Times earlier this week he was a no on the rescissions package, saying he wouldn’t follow His “party off the cliff.”
Behind Bacon’s flip
Bacon flipped his vote to yes after a brief floor conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson as the vote was held open. States Newsroom also reported that New York Republican Rep. Nick LaLota also changed his vote after a similar talk.

Bacon told the Nebraska Examiner on Thursday that he got reassurances from House GOP leadership to find funding for international AIDS prevention and at least some funding for public media. 
“I was reassured by House Republican leadership that PBS would receive funding for next year, and it would go to annual funding after that,” Bacon said. “They also told me that PEPFAR funding for life-saving treatments will not be affected. Because of these reassurances, I voted yes on H.R. 4.”
PEPFAR, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched by former President George W. Bush in 2003. 
Bacon had previously said that if Nebraska Public Media loses funding, its “absence” would “leave a void.”
Bacon’s critics, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said it continued a trend of Bacon saying one thing publicly to sound moderate and ultimately voting with the party — though he recently voted against party lines for a bill that would rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.
“How many times have we seen this same tired act from him?” DCCC Spokesperson Madison Andrus said. 
Budget impact
While federal funding accounts for only a fraction of the budget for national independent public news organizations, it does help smaller, often rural, local affiliate stations afford to operate in places the free market might not serve. 
The impact of the cuts on Nebraska Public Media could be significant, up to 16% of its annual budget, which could put essential services, including emergency alert systems, at risk, the organization has said. NPM is responsible for most public TV and radio stations in the state. It receives approximately $4 million in federal funding, representing roughly 16% of its annual budget. 
Nebraska Public Media is tasked with live-streaming the legislative session and public hearings on bills. NPM also covers state government daily during legislative sessions. NPM also broadcasts and streams local high school and college sports. It also issues essential vital alerts for severe storms and other emergencies. 
The state funds roughly 44% of the NPM budget, according to information published on the NPM website. 
Nebraska Public Media officials said they were “disappointed in the outcome of this vote” as “clawing back funding already approved by Congress threatens the core mission of public media, especially in rural areas.” 
“These aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet,” NPM General Manager and CEO Stacey Decker said. “Federal investment underpins the journalism we produce, the educational resources we share with children and families, the remarkable stories we tell about our state.” 
Not just NPM
KIOS, a smaller Omaha public radio station that Omaha Public Schools operates, received approximately $154,000 this year in federal funding. Omaha Public Schools officials decline to comment on the vote but are monitoring the potential impact on the station.
Flood, in a joint statement with the House Main Street caucus, said the rescission package “codifies important spending cuts identified by the Trump administration.” 
“This package ends funding for foreign programs that are antithetical to American values, stops woke gender and climate programs and reins in wasteful spending,” the statement reads. 
Flood in May echoed criticisms of NPR’s national bias but defended the value Nebraska Public Media provides locally in previous Examiner reporting. 
Smith called the package another “step toward fiscal responsibility.” 
“I will continue working with the administration and my colleagues to follow through on spending priorities overwhelmingly supported by the American people at the ballot box last November,” Smith said.

These rallies have happened weekly since the mass layoffs first started at the CDC in February. Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderFired workers of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and their supporters are pushing for more public health jobs to be restored after a portion of the center’s terminated workforce was reinstated this week. 
Many of the more than 460 workers reinstated are assigned to the National Center for Environmental Health or the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and Tuberculosis Prevention, according to the Associated Press.
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to slash 10,000 jobs in late March, including 2,400 jobs at the CDC. 
The reinstated workers received a two-paragraph memorandum Wednesday from Tom Nagy, chief human capital officer with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, that said they were no longer part of the previously announced reduction in force, according to a copy of the memo obtained by the Georgia Recorder. 
“You will not be affected by the upcoming RIF,” the memo says. 
Sarah Boim, a former communication specialist at the CDC who is a leader of the group Fired But Fighting, which describes itself as a coalition of fired CDC employees and allies, said some of the reinstated staffers were already back at work Thursday.
Boim said the restored jobs are not enough, but she said she is skeptical that more people will be brought back since the newly reinstated group represents about 20% of the job losses at the CDC – which would mirror what Kennedy said earlier would need to be reversed because of “mistakes” made by the Department of Government Efficiency. 
Lawsuits challenging the terminations at the CDC and other federal agencies are also working their way through the courts.
Boim said the saga has left laboratory scientists and others sidelined from their work while collecting administrative pay.
“It’s mind boggling — the level of inefficiency and chaos that this whole process has sown,” she said. “I would like people to know that their money was going to pay for people with critical jobs to not do their jobs.”
Georgia Democrats who have pressed for the Trump administration to reverse course on the CDC cuts cheered the news Thursday but pressed for more fired CDC workers to be brought back. 
“The rehiring of hundreds of dedicated health workers, many of whom call Georgia home, is welcome news for those of us who believe that public health is vital to our wellbeing and safety — not a political game,” U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock said in a statement.
Warnock participated in a rally outside the CDC in April. Those rallies have been held every week since the mass layoffs started in February, with one held Tuesday despite the rain after Kennedy fired members of a key vaccine panel. 
“Under Secretary Kennedy’s leadership, the nation’s critical public health functions remain intact and effective,” Emily G. Hilliard, press secretary for the federal agency, said in a statement Thursday. “The Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services—whether it’s supporting coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH, safeguarding public health through lead prevention, or researching and tracking the most prevalent communicable diseases.”

(Screenshot from livestream on Sen. Shaheen’s youtube channel)Federal cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development assistance programs will hurt American farmers and the safety of their crops, said several agricultural research leaders at a forum hosted by U.S. Senate Democrats.
“These cuts are clearly problematic for our standing in the world, our leadership in the world, our security, our trade relationships,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. “But it also socks us here at home.”
Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member, hosted a forum to discuss the relationship between foreign assistance programs and the U.S. agriculture market.
Through the Food for Peace program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture facilitates purchases of American crops and partners with non-governmental organizations to distribute these surplus crops to crisis areas around the world. Under the 2026 fiscal year budget request, this program will see major cuts, which may impact American farmers, forum speakers said. Additionally, the reduction of funding to agriculture innovation labs at public universities may leave U.S. crops vulnerable to future diseases.
Cuts to innovation labs may leave U.S. crops unprepared
Dr. David Hughes, director of the USAID Innovation Lab on Current and Emerging Threats to Crops at Penn State University, said funding cuts impact his team’s ability to study potential threats to U.S. agriculture in “safe spaces” around the globe.
His innovation lab, along with the Food Safety Program at Purdue University, the Livestock Systems Program at University of Florida and Peanut Production, a program addressing malnutrition at the University of Georgia, are among the universities that will see cuts under the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE.
Hughes said his team members study threats to agriculture overseas, to “quickly deploy” mechanisms against those threats when the time comes. One threat the team is studying is thrips, a small insect that poses a risk to the U.S. floral industry. His team uses a space in Nepal to reduce risk to local crops.
Additionally, Hughes and his team at Penn State have been developing an artificial intelligence system called PlantVillage which provides advice to help farmers cope with climate change to increase the yield and profitability of their crops.
He says many American and European scientists are “decamping” to China because they fill a space of “research excellence” left by cuts to research in the United States.
“You want to make sure if you do have an AI system giving knowledge to American farmers, you better be sure it’s not a made-in-China system.” Hughes said.
Farmers benefit from USDA purchase of surplus
“To be able to count on that institutional market that comes from food assistance is a significant benefit to the U.S. farmer,” said Thoric Cederstrom, International Food Aid representative on the U.S. Dry Bean Council.
Cederstrom said he doesn’t think there is any organization that “stands ready to fill that void,” left by USAID. He argues there is “enlightened self-interest” in the purchase of American crops from farmers to be used as aid abroad. This purchase helps in “stabilizing demand and prices for farmers across the heartland” and “offset the risk of unpredictable market, trade disruptions and climate variability.” The USAID programs create a market that farms can respond to to turn a profit and “generate income that keeps their businesses active.”
Cuts to USDA Inspection Service leave Americans vulnerable to disease
“There couldn’t be a worse time to lower our guard,” said Kevin Shea, former administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA. “African swine fever in the Dominican Republic, very close to our shores, very easily just one trip away from getting here. That’s just one example. Foot and mouth disease, eradicated a century ago in America, is now appearing all around the world for the first time in many, many years. Another big concern for us. And screwworm has breached the barrier in Panama for many years and has made it into Mexico.”
Shea says that the inspection service has lost nearly 1,300 or around 15% of the workforce has left “in the past few months”  and with the additional cuts under the FY26 budget request “APHIS can not do its job.”
Both Hughes and Shea talked about citrus greening disease, which has impacted the citrus industry in Florida as an example of the need for research and inspection programs.
USAID career staff unable to move current stock to areas in need
Sarah Charles, former assistant to the administrator of USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said despite the cuts, the career staff left at USAID are working “furiously” to move food kept in warehouses around that globe, “even knowing they have been fired,” to areas in need.
She also said the U.S. government response to crises, such as the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, has been “limited” because the capacity has been “taken offline by the Trump administration.”
China showed up in a major capacity, but many of its outreach programs are through the government, so the networks built by the U.S. with non-governmental partners and civil society organizations have been “abandoned,” Charles said.
“Food rations that could supply three and a half million people for a month are rotting in warehouses around the world because of USAID cuts,”  Shaheen said. “Sadly, people are going hungry while farmers are losing a critical buyer for their crops.”

Air monitoring stations in Choteau, Cut Bank, Havre and Glasgow all had periods of “Unhealthy” air over the last 48 hours, with air quality index moving over 200 on Wednesday morning in some towns.
As of 5 p.m. on Thursday, the AQI in many of those places had dropped down into the moderate category.

When air gets smokey, it’s best to be inside and avoid extreme outdoor physical exertion. Air filters can also help vulnerable populations.
Fire have been burning in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan since May. Some Canadian smoke has even drifted as far as Europe.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Changes outlined in President Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill impacting Medicaid expansion, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and taxes could be a $160 million hit to Montana’s state budget, according to an estimate this week from the Legislative Fiscal Division.
Legislative Finance Committee members met this week and, among numerous topics, heard a report from the Legislative Fiscal Division on impacts of federal legislation. A couple of Democrats described the potential reductions as “staggering” and “frightening.”
Trump’s tax cuts would reduce revenue from the taxable income of Montana by $122 million, said Josh Poulette, with the state’s fiscal division.
The changes could mean “either less general fund coming in or more general fund that needs to go out,” Poulette said during the finance committee meeting.
Additionally, if the federal bill was signed into law in its current form, the state would be on the hook for more than $26 million in SNAP benefits if it was to keep the program running as it is now.
Legislators heard the report Tuesday, and at the meeting, the committee discussed potential dates for a special session of the Legislature to address the reductions should one be needed.
Trump’s bill could be signed into law soon. While speaking with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday, U.S. Senator Steve Daines said lawmakers in the Senate are trying to get it on the president’s desk by July 4.
Daines also said the Congressional Budget Office is wrong in its forecast of revenue projections and that the bill will “make some of the largest cuts, true spending cuts, to this runaway spending from the federal government in American history.”
The biggest direct hit to the state’s budget would be the reduction in taxable income. It means the state would have more than $120 million less in its general fund because the law changes deductions.
SNAP would become more expensive because the state would be required to provide a match. The federal government currently pays for the cost of all SNAP benefits.
“This would be tied to the payment error rate of the state. So essentially, the feds do a backward looking error rate calculation for SNAP, and they’ve got historical data on that,” Poulette said during the meeting. “Montana’s error rate has hovered in that 78% range over the years. That would equate to Montana having a 15% match requirement that would come out to a cost of about $26 million additional state funds per year.”
Medicaid expansion, meanwhile, could see 27,000 people dropped. Medicaid covers about 13% of all workers in the state. The Montana Legislature this session approved an extension removing the Medicaid expansion sunset date.
One of the big changes the federal bill makes is increased work requirements to be eligible for benefits. Montana already has this law on the books, but it’s never been enforced, and the Biden Administration did not approve the state’s request to add the stipulation.
Most people on Medicaid expansion already work, and in Montana, the number of people who are enrolled in the program and work is 72%. Another 7% are caretaking, 2% are retired and 10% are acutely ill or disabled and have serious barriers to employment.
Poulette also said there is “essentially a ban” on new taxes on medical providers. Those taxes are often pumped into the Medicaid program, he added. 
Rep. Connie Keogh, a Missoula Democrat and a member of the committee, called the impact to the budget “frightening” during Tuesday’s meeting, while Rep. Paul Tuss, D-Havre, said during the meeting the numbers were “staggering.”
Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office did not respond to a request for comment. However in a recent “Leave Us Alone” podcast episode, the Republican governor did speak on the topic.
“If you believe in limited government, the best way to produce that is to limit the amount of money government collects,” Gianforte said. “Let’s leave it in the people’s pockets.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8965-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

A month ago, state revenues lagged the Idaho Legislature’s projection by $97.7 million, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Now, revenues are running $141.5 million below the Idaho Legislature’s forecast with less than one month remaining in the fiscal year, according to the May Budget and Revenue Monitor report.
Idaho is still projected to finish the 2025 fiscal year on June 30 with a positive ending balance of $278.2 million, according to the May report.
However, that projected ending balance has shrunk from the approximately $420 million ending balance that the Idaho Legislature planned on when the 2025 legislative session adjourned April 4.
 Declining sales tax distribution a driving factor in state’s revenue shortfall

The revenue forecasts and collections are important because the Idaho Legislature built them into the state budget. 
Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30 every year. That means fiscal year 2025 is about to end, and fiscal year 2026 is about to begin.

Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, said the new revenue report shows positive strength in Idaho’s economy despite the missed forecast.
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, is a powerful legislative committee that sets the budget for every state agency and department. 
Compared to last year, revenue collections are up by $145.3 million, or 2.9%, according to the May report.
“I think this gives us good news about Idaho’s economy,” Horman said in a phone interview Thursday afternoon. “Sometimes when you look at numbers against a forecast, it tells us more about the forecast than the revenue.”
The revenue report shows the sales tax distributions were less than last year and a driving factor in the revenue shortfall. Other revenue sources, including individual income tax collections, corporate income tax and miscellaneous revenues, were all up.
Lori Wolff, administrator of the Idaho Division of Financial Management, also expressed confidence in Idaho’s economy after the revenue report was released Thursday.

“Gov. Little and the Legislature have consistently prioritized responsible budgeting, which has led to Idaho’s tremendous economic success,” Wolff said in a written statement. “We are still seeing year over year growth in revenue, signaling a strong Idaho economy. We have made investments in critical priorities while leaving a $400 million cushion on the bottom line to hedge against revenue softening. Idaho also has 22% of General Fund revenues in rainy day funds, greater than almost every other state. While we continue to watch revenue closely, we feel good about the strength of the state budget and our economy.”
Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said her heart sank when she read the new revenue report. She said the state will still have enough money to pay for programs in the current year’s budget, but she worries cuts are forthcoming next year.
“I am deeply concerned that all of the tax cuts and the underestimating of revenue will create an on-ramp for my legislative colleagues to easily and unfortunately cut valuable programs and services that Idahoans need,” Wintrow said in a phone interview Thursday. “That is really what I have been dreading this whole time.”
 Tax cuts passed by Idaho Legislature reduce revenue available to the state

During the 2025 legislative session, the Idaho Legislature cut taxes by $400 million and provided an additional $50 million to create a new refundable tax credit for education expenses, including tuition at private, religious schools.
Those actions reduced the amount of state revenue that the state has to spend in its budget by $453 million.  
The role of revenue in the budget is extremely important. The Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget each year where expenses don’t exceed revenues. 
Horman said the newest revenue numbers still demonstrate the Idaho Legislature took a responsible approach to budgeting this year. 
“It makes me especially glad we more than doubled the amount we typically leave on the bottom line when we adjourned sine die because it’s giving us a cushion to adjust to the decline in sales tax revenue,” Horman said, using the Latin term sine die that legislators use when they adjourn the legislative session for the year.
Horman said it will be important to monitor all revenue sources between now and when the Idaho Legislature convenes the 2026 session in January. 
She also said it would be a concern if revenues continued to to fall below the forecast in the coming months and into the forthcoming 2026 fiscal year.
“Looking at the trends with sales tax tells us we made the right decision to have conservative budgeting this year, and we will need to monitor all revenue sources between now and January,” Horman said. “I do anticipate another year of probably even more conservative budgeting (next year) than we saw this year.”
Horman said the Idaho Legislature has invested $7 billion in infrastructure projects like roads, school facilities, water projects, the permanent building fund and more over the past five years. She said the $1.05 to $1.55 per hour pay increases for state employees approved this year represent the largest salary increase in terms of dollars in state history.

But Horman said next year’s budget may be more lean in terms of spending.
“We will need to be cautious about investments we make in the maintenance budgets as well as the budget enhancements moving forward,” Horman said, referencing the new budget procedures where JFAC splits agency budgets into two parts.
Wintrow said she’s worried. 
“I don’t see my colleagues going back on their tax cuts to increase revenue, and my heart sinks wondering about the effects, which are dramatic and potentially harmful,” Wintrow said.

(Jordan Gale/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A “historic” deal made two years ago between the U.S. government, four tribes, Northwest states and environmentalists to put legal battles aside and invest in restoring endangered Columbia River fish runs is now off.
President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a presidential memorandum withdrawing the U.S. government from a Dec. 14, 2023, agreement to help restore salmon, steelhead and other native fish being decimated by federal hydroelectric dams in the Columbia River Basin.
The 2023 agreement was reached after decades of legal battles that pitted the federal government against four Lower Columbia River tribes and environmental groups backed by the states of Oregon and Washington.

 Nez Perce Tribe chairman: Salmon extinction is a truth happening now

Groups behind the suits said they would forge on, and legal battles will likely reopen.
“This move by the Trump administration to throw away five years’ worth of progress is shortsighted and reckless,” said Mitch Cutter, a salmon and energy strategist at the Idaho Conservation League, in a statement. “The Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement was a landmark achievement between the federal government, states, Tribes and salmon advocates to find solutions for salmon and stay out of the courtroom. Now, it’s gone thanks to the uninformed impulses of a disconnected administration that doesn’t understand the Pacific Northwest and the rivers and fish that make our region special.”
Electricity demand in Northwest could double in next 20 years, forecast finds

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon and the Nez Perce Tribe were part of the deal. In negotiations, the tribes, along with the states of Oregon and Washington, are referred to as the “six sovereigns.”
Shannon Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe, said in a statement that Trump’s decision is a denial of the truth.
“This action tries to hide from the truth. The Nez Perce Tribe holds a duty to speak the truth for the salmon, and the truth is that extinction of salmon populations is happening now,” he said. “People across the Northwest know this, and people across the nation have supported us in a vision for preventing salmon extinction that would at the same time create a stronger and better future for the Northwest. This remains the shared vision of the states of Washington and Oregon, and the Yakama, Umatilla, Warm Springs and Nez Perce tribes, as set out in our Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative.”
Groups representing utilities, farmers, ports and others who rely on Columbia River dams for power, moving goods and irrigation, celebrated the executive order.
“As demand for electricity surges across the nation, preserving access to always-available energy resources like hydropower is absolutely crucial,” said Jim Matheson, CEO of the trade group National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, in a news release.
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, also applauded Trump’s decision, saying in a Thursday press release that he has long opposed tearing down the dams and that Congress alone has the power to decide their fate. In January, Risch introduced the Northwest Energy Security Act to protect the lower Snake River dams.
“The Biden administration’s one-sided, backroom agreement blatantly disregarded the essential role the lower Snake River dams play and the Idaho communities that rely on them,” Risch said. “Today’s announcement by President Trump represents a return to sound science and common-sense.”
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek’s office could not be reached for comment Thursday afternoon.
 Snake River dams provide irrigation, hydropower, but also contribute to salmon declines

At the heart of the issue are four Snake River dams that provide irrigation and emissions-free hydropower for nearby communities, but have also contributed to the near extinction of 13 salmon and steelhead populations that return to the Columbia Basin from the Pacific Ocean to spawn. The fish are important to tribal health and sovereignty and to basin ecosystems, and the declines are hitting southern resident orcas off the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon that rely on salmon for food and that are federally listed as endangered.
Fears over Columbia Basin dams, hydroelectricity grow as agencies lose hundreds of employees

Environmental advocates, tribes and others have pushed to remove the four dams – Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite on the Snake River between Kennewick, Washington, and Lewiston, Idaho – to help the fish, including filing lawsuits. Earthjustice, an environmental law group, has led litigation against five federal agencies, seeking changes to dam operations in the Columbia River Basin to help protect salmon.
The 2023 agreement, coupled with Biden-era climate and clean energy funding, was meant to pour more than $1 billion in new federal investments for wild fish restoration into the Columbia River Basin over the next decade, along with clean energy projects on tribal lands. It also included potentially breaching the four Snake River Dams to restore natural flows that could revive native salmon populations.
Earthjustice Attorney Amanda Goodin said in a statement that they would not give up fighting in court to prevent salmon extinction in the Columbia River Basin.
“The Trump administration is turning its back on an unprecedented opportunity to support a thriving Columbia Basin — and ignoring the extinction crisis facing our salmon,” she said. “Unfortunately, this short-sighted decision to renege on this important agreement is just the latest in a series of anti-government and anti-science actions coming from the Trump administration.”

Between 2018 and 2023, the number of applications for H-2A workers increased by 72%, according to a new analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Screenshot taken Nov. 15, 2024, GAO official YouTube channel (Credit: Ben Felder / Investigate Midwest)Every year, hundreds of thousands of foreign workers come to the U.S. to fill temporary agricultural labor shortages through the H-2A program — a system first introduced in 1986 to address shortages in farmwork.
From 2011 to 2024, the use of the program grew more than 400%, with nearly 90% of visas going to workers from Mexico.
But the fastest-growing group is from South Africa – and predominantly white, according to private and federal lawsuits.

While South Africans consist of only 3% of the program, their numbers have climbed by 1,300% according to data from the State Department between 2011 and 2024, and the rate of increase far outpaces any other nationality.
The rapid rise has collided with legal scrutiny.
Since 2022, the Mississippi Center for Justice, a law firm focused on advancing racial and economic justice, has filed seven lawsuits on behalf of Black farmworkers in Mississippi, alleging they were paid less than temporary workers from abroad who were mostly white men from South Africa.

Each of those lawsuits were settled out of court with significant compensation and back pay, according to attorney Rob McDuff, who represented the plaintiffs. The latest case, filed in May, is still pending.
“This is the latest version of an age-old problem in America, in terms of the treatment of Black farmworkers,” McDuff said.
The Department of Labor, under the Biden administration, conducted its own investigation following those initial lawsuits and found 44 additional agricultural employers in Mississippi to be in violation of the H-2A program’s law. By 2023, the department’s Wage and Hour Division had recovered $505,000 in back wages for 161 workers whose rights were violated. Employers were also required to pay an additional $341,838 in civil money penalties.
The South African Chamber of Commerce in the USA, a non-partisan, independent organization and business association, promotes the work program to its citizens. After the lawsuits, the organization worked with the U.S. Ambassador to South Africa to make the H-2A program more inclusive and diverse.
The federal government tracks the country of origin for visa holders, but does not collect data on which businesses hire those workers. Agricultural companies in the southeast host the largest number of H-2A workers in the nation.
Because South Africans speak English and their growing and harvest seasons are the opposite of North America’s, they make attractive candidates.
“You can get any nationality you want in H-2A, and we chose South Africans because their English is better,” Joel Brown, a farmer in Missouri, told Farm Progress. “There are a lot of large farms in South Africa, and some of these guys are coming off those farms.”

Free.,"Judge says Trump takeover of California National Guard 'illegal,' orders return to governor",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-says-trump-takeover-california-national-guard-illegal-orders-return-governor,,"A federal judge in California late Thursday ordered President Donald Trump to relinquish command of 4,000 National Guard troops the president called to help contain Los Angeles protests over immigration raids.U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump’s mobilization of the National Guard was illegal, and ordered the return of control to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had opposed the deployment. He said his order would go into effect noon Pacific time Friday, likely setting up an emergency appeal by the administration.Trump’s “actions were illegal—both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,” Breyer wrote.He issued the 36-page order mere hours after an afternoon hearing at which he appeared skeptical that Trump's order was lawful.Breyer at the hearing appeared not to accept the Trump administration’s argument that obtaining consent from Newsom, a Democrat, was not a prerequisite to federalize the California National Guard.Newsom has been backed up by Democratic attorneys general across the nation in the closely watched case.Breyer noted the law Trump cited when mobilizing the troops requires the order to go through a state’s governor, but Trump’s order bypassed Newsom and went directly to the adjutant general of the California National Guard.“I'm trying to figure out how something is through somebody if, in fact, you didn't give it to him, you actually sent it to the adjutant general,” Breyer said. “It would be the first time I've ever seen something going through somebody if it never went to them directly.”‘A constitutional government and King George’U.S. Justice Department attorney Brett Shumate, who argued for the administration, said Newsom’s approval was not necessary for the commander-in-chief to call National Guard troops into service.“There's no consultation requirement, pre-approval requirement,” he said. “The governor is merely a conduit. He's not a roadblock. The president doesn't have to call up the governor, invite them to Camp David, ‘Let's have a summit, negotiate for a week about what are the terms that we're going to call up the National Guard in your state, what are the terms of the deployment?’”The president alone can determine whether the conditions allowing for the federalization of the National Guard are met, Shumate said.But Breyer, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, said the president faced more limits on his authority than Shumate had argued.“That's the difference between a constitutional government and King George,” Breyer said.Nicholas Green, who argued on behalf of the state, called the federal government’s argument “breathtaking in scope,” in part because the troops appear to be assisting in domestic law enforcement.“They are saying, Your Honor, that the president, by fiat, can federalize the National Guard and deploy it in the streets of a civilian city whenever he perceives that there is disobedience to an order,” Green told Breyer. “That is an expansive, dangerous conception of federal executive power.”Breyer seemed less opposed to Trump’s order to deploy 700 U.S. Marines to the area, noting those troops are not yet on the ground in Los Angeles and, as federal troops, were already under Trump’s command without needing to satisfy any other criteria.Breyer’s order Thursday night did not direct any action regarding the Marines.Pause requestedThe judge, who is the brother of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, said he would rule quickly, possibly late Thursday, on California’s request for a restraining order to stop the deployment in Los Angeles.Shuman requested that, if Breyer found in favor of the state, he should pause any restraining order while the federal government appeals.Green said the state would “strongly oppose” such a pause because of the urgency of the situation in Los Angeles.The city has seen days of protests starting on Friday over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids on workplaces. Trump ordered the National Guard to the area on Sunday, saying it was necessary to restore order.Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass objected to the decision and have said it has caused more chaos and inflamed tensions.Democrats’ amicus briefThe hearing on California’s request for an injunction came a day after 21 Democratic attorneys general and the Democratic governor of Kansas filed an amicus brief in the case backing up California.Trump wresting control of a state National Guard sets a dangerous precedent that undermines National Guard missions, they said.“National Guard troops fight fires, respond to hurricanes, protect their residents from flooding, and provide much-needed security,” they wrote. “By undermining states’ authority, unlawfully deploying the National Guard troops, and leaving the door wide open to deploy the Guards of every state, the President has made us all less safe. This Court should enjoin the federal government from continuing down this unlawful and perilous path.”In addition to Kansas Gov. Laura Kelley, the attorneys general of Washington, Delaware, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin and Rhode Island signed the brief.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

House Budget Chair Lawrence McClure gave reporters a “yes” when asked if their timeline to finish the work by Monday would work, whereas Senate Budget Chair Ed Hooper answered “maybe.” 
“I think the last two days may be the most productive we’ve had,” Hooper told reporters Thursday evening. Lawmakers voted last week to extend their time to finish the budget until June 18, ahead of the June 30 when the current year’s budget expires.
The budget chairs didn’t meet in public on Wednesday and had only one conference on Tuesday. Hooper said there weren’t enough substantial offers to warrant a meeting on Wednesday. The chambers presented offers on several silos on Thursday evening, such as education, criminal justice, and health care. 
“The president committed to the speaker this afternoon that we are going to do everything in our power to have this thing on the desk sometime tomorrow for a Monday vote,” Hooper said. 
Lawmakers have to wait 72 hours after work on the budget is done to vote on it. 
The Legislature agreed they would spend $50 billion in general revenue before returning to Tallahassee last week. The Legislative leaders have also touted a plan to eliminate taxes on business rent and $350 million in permanent sales tax exemptions. However, the sales tax exemption deal hasn’t been finalized either.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)A five-member majority of the Arkansas Supreme Court granted the state judicial discipline commission’s request for changes to the rules for judges’ and justices’ conduct in a Thursday per curiam order.
The changes concern accusations of judicial misconduct and disciplinary action against judges and justices who face such allegations. The divide among the Supreme Court justices who supported or dissented from the order mirrored conflicts within the court earlier this year. Chief Justice Karen Baker and Associate Justice Courtney Hudson dissented from the order.
Thursday’s order approved two alterations to the Judicial Code of Conduct: a new provision allowing the court to issue interim suspensions of judges accused of crimes or misconduct and an amendment that broadens an existing rule requiring cooperation with disciplinary authorities and prohibiting retaliation.
According to the rule regarding suspensions, the Supreme Court may suspend a judge with pay “upon notice of the filing of an indictment, information, or complaint charging the judge with a ‘serious crime’ under state or federal law.”

In_re_Rule_of_Jud._Disc._Enforcement 
A “serious crime” includes “any felony or lesser crime that reflects adversely on the judge’s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a judge in other respects” or any crime involving “interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, deceit, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, theft or an attempt, conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit a ‘serious crime,’” the rule states.
The rule is based on a model policy from the American Bar Association, and the Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission specifically asked the high court for the rule, according to the order. The commission investigates complaints about the conduct of judges and justices and has the authority to recommend disciplinary actions.
The rule also allows suspensions for “other misconduct,” which includes but is not limited to “witness intimidation, retaliation, or a threat thereof.”
Another portion of the code of conduct states that a judge “shall cooperate and be candid and honest with judicial and lawyer disciplinary agencies” and must not retaliate “against a person known or suspected to have assisted or cooperated with an investigation” of judicial misconduct.
The amended provision approved by the Supreme Court majority specifies that intimidation is also prohibited and that the rule applies to “a judge, justice, special judge/justice, judicial candidate, or judge-elect.”
Earlier this year, the high court ordered the release of a report alleging that Baker harassed judiciary employees on Dec. 4-5, 2024, after she was elected but before she was sworn in as the state’s first elected female chief justice.
“Justice Baker intimidated staff, appears to have targeted female employees of color, indicated an intention to retaliate based on her perception of how employees voted, and indicated an intention to retaliate based on her perception of whether employees were cooperating with Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission’s investigation into her colleague’s conduct,” the report from the Administrative Office of the Courts human resources department states.

UPDATED: Arkansas Supreme Court chief justice harassed court staff, per human resources report


 Dissent and concurrence

Baker co-signed Hudson’s dissenting opinion on Thursday’s per curiam order. Hudson wrote that the rule regarding suspensions “presents legitimate due-process concerns.”
“It contains absolutely no requirement that notice be provided to the impacted judge either before or after the interim suspension or that the judge be allowed an opportunity to respond to an allegation of misconduct,” Hudson wrote.
She also raised the possibility that the rule violates the state and federal constitutions’ ban on adopting rules or laws that govern conduct prior to their adoption.
Associate Justice Rhonda Wood responded to Hudson’s dissent with a concurring opinion. Wood argued that the new rule creates more due process for judges, not less, because it “provides guidelines previously nonexistent.”
The rule also “sets out parameters for the current authority” that the Supreme Court has always had to suspend judges accused of misconduct and is not a completely new policy applied retroactively, Wood wrote.
Judicial conduct has been at the forefront of the Arkansas Supreme Court since September 2024. Five of Hudson’s colleagues referred her to the JDDC for “flagrant breaches of confidentiality” after she filed then-Chief Justice John Dan Kemp’s emails into evidence in her attempt to block the release of emails between her, Baker and others in response to a FOIA request from Arkansas Business.
Arkansas Supreme Court refers one of its own for disciplinary investigation

Baker dissented to Hudson’s referral to JDDC, and she made transparency a focus of her successful runoff campaign against Wood to succeed Kemp, who did not run for reelection last year.
Within days of taking the oath of office Jan. 1, Baker butted heads with the rest of the court over the scope of her authority as chief justice. Hudson was the only one of Baker’s colleagues who did not block the chief justice’s attempts to fire 10 judiciary employees and appoint three new judges to the judicial discipline body. The other five justices claimed Baker did not have the authority to make such unilateral decisions without consulting the rest of the court.
Issues of judicial misconduct have not been limited to the Supreme Court this year. Former Monroe County district judge and deputy prosecutor T. David Carruth was sentenced in May to two years in federal prison for making false statements to the FBI. He had been admonished by the JDDC in 2018 for improper conduct in violation of the Judicial Code of Ethics.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota lawmakers will not convene to make the call on a new prison site on July 22, according to Gov. Larry Rhoden’s office.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen wrote a letter to Rhoden this week asking that the special session the governor had hoped to call on that date be pushed back. Lawmakers would be asked to back plans for a new prison at that session.
Venhuizen leads the Project Prison Reset group, called into being in February via a Rhoden executive order and charged with deciding if the state needs new prison facilities, how large and where those facilities should be.
Members voted during a Springfield meeting in late April to build a replacement for the South Dakota State Penitentiary, which is located in Sioux Falls.
Pierre played host to the group’s most recent meeting last week, where the group narrowed down locations to Mitchell or Worthing and existing prison campuses in Springfield and Sioux Falls, and voted to cap the cost of such a prison at $600 million. Elected officials in Mitchell including the mayor and sheriff have since come out against locating the prison near their community.
Prison task force rejects original Lincoln County site, tightens budget for new facility

This week, Venhuizen wrote that the group had made “excellent progress,” but that the two weeks between the next Project Prison Reset meeting and the intended special session aren’t enough.
“Even if the task force is able to adopt a specific proposal on July 8, we do not feel that two weeks provides adequate time for a final proposal to be completed with adequate detail, and for state legislators to learn about that proposal prior to the special session,” Venhuizen wrote.
Rhoden, through spokeswoman Josie Harms, said the governor will “accept the task force’s request” and “consult with leadership on a rescheduled date.”
“I’m eager to see what the task force can accomplish in their next meeting,” Rhoden wrote.
The cost of the Rhoden administration’s preferred solution to correctional overcrowding – a 1,500-bed, $825 million facility south of Harrisburg in Lincoln County – was among the primary concerns for the lawmakers who rejected the idea in February.
A consultant hired on behalf of the task force to reevaluate the state’s needs concluded that the state needs more beds than that, 1,700, immediately, to ease current crowding.
A 1,700-bed prison wouldn’t solve the state’s problems long-term, however, according to the consultants. By the mid-2030s, the state would need yet another 1,500-bed prison.
The task force ultimately rejected those conclusions, betting that $600 million would be enough to bulk up the system and replace the oldest parts of the Sioux Falls penitentiary complex.
Lawmakers had put back more than $600 million for prison construction before the 2025 legislative session, and the fund had swelled larger than that with interest by winter.
Ongoing construction bills at the site of a new women’s prison in Rapid City – an $87 million project that earned legislative approval – have since come out of that fund, DOC spokesman Michael Winder told Searchlight on Thursday.
The state’s also paid some of the bills associated with site prep at the now-rejected Lincoln County site out of that fund. Lawmakers had approved the spending of up to $60 million in prison design and site prep for a men’s prison in 2024, and the state spent or obligated $52 million of that money for the Lincoln County plan before it came to a halt.
Subtracting the money spent since the last legislative session’s end and adding the $23 million earned in interest this year that will be deposited in August, Winder said, the fund’s available balance will sit at approximately $538 million by the end of summer.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/EM8A0469-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

A four-day trial over the district concluded on Thursday afternoon and judges must decide whether the constitutional rights of voters in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties were violated when the Legislature created the Senate district in 2022 that crossed from St. Petersburg over the water to Hillsborough County.
Florida was sued by three voters who are represented by the ACLU of Florida and the Civil Rights & Racial Justice Clinic at New York University School of Law. The plaintiffs allege that the Legislature’s plan to connect Black populations from parts of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties violated their equal-protection rights by unjustifiably packing Black voters into District 16 and removing them from nearby District 18, reducing their influence there.
The defendants, Senate President Ben Albritton and Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, have denied that claim, saying that the maps were lawfully drawn up and previously approved as legally sound by the Florida Supreme Court.
But the defense’s arguments go beyond refuting the plaintiffs’ claims. Indeed the defense went on the offense both before and during the trial to allege that the ACLU of Florida’s lead attorney in the case, Nicholas Warren, worked behind the scenes with Democratic House and Senate staffers to try to get a partisan map approved.

To bolster that argument, attorneys representing the state called Matthew Isbell to the stand (remotely) on Thursday, their last witness.
Isbell is a Tallahassee-based data analyst and consultant who has worked with Democrats and Democratic-affiliated groups over the past decade. Text and direct Twitter messages between Isbell and Warren were displayed to the court showing how both men hoped that the Senate would adopt a map that kept Pinellas County intact and separate from Hillsborough County.
Warren drew his own map that kept the two counties separate and introduced it before the redistricting committee in late 2021, without identifying himself as being a staff attorney for the ACLU of Florida. Sen. Ray Rodrigues, who was chair of the Senate Committee on Reapportionment at the time, subsequently sent a memo to all 40 state senators accusing him of violating Senate rules by not disclosing that he was with the ACLU of Florida.
Warren testified earlier this week that he drew the map on his own personal time and resources, and that the Senate forms that needed to be completed to appear before the committee did not require an individual to list his employer.
Isbell testified on Thursday that he believed that the GOP-majority Legislature’s motivation to split the city of St. Petersburg up was motivated by partisan politics, an allegation that attorneys for the Florida Senate president’s office have strongly refuted.
After Isbell’s video appearance concluded, the closing statements began, starting with the plaintiffs.
 “Race predominated”

Warren declared that “race predominated in the drawing of the district.”
In terms of direct evidence to back up that statement, Warren played a video clip from a November 2021 committee hearing. The excerpt shows Orange County Democratic Sen. Randolph Bracy asked Senate Committee on Reapportionment staff director Jay Ferrin why the newly proposed Senate District 16 district had to cross from St. Petersburg over into Tampa Bay and Hillsborough County.

Ferrin replied that it was to comply with the Fair Districts amendment in the Florida Constitution, specifically the “Tier 1” standards which provide protections for racial and language minorities. Bracy then asked Ferrin if there was a way to configure the district to comply with the Fair Districts amendment and still keep the two countries separate. 
Another video exchange showed Pasco County Republican Danny Burgess,telling Bracy that Senate “staff” had said keeping the counties separate wasn’t possible, because it would lead to a “significant number of voters who would be disenfranchised.” At the time  Burgess was the chair of another Senate committee that also dealt with reapportionment.
Ferrin agreed with Burgess, saying it would result in a“wide diminishment” that would ultimately disenfranchise Black voters in Pinellas County.
Bracy followed up asking how much the Black vote would be diminished by if the counties were to remain separate. Ferrin replied “close to 30%,”and added that such a reduction “would constitute diminishment.”
That comment, Warren said in his closing, revealed that race placed a major role in why Senate District 16 was created.
 Failing to make the case?

The defense came back with closing statements from the two attorneys representing their side: Daniel Nordby, who was representing Ben Albritton in his official capacity as president of the Florida Senate, and Mohammad Jazil, who was representing Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd.
Nordby said the plaintiffs had to prove that race was a predominant factor in the creation of Senate District 16, but that they fell short.
“Plaintiffs have not come close to doing so,” Nordby said.
He emphasized how Ferrin had recognized the constitutional requirements for drawing up districts – which is that districts should be compact, and when possible, utilize existing political and geographic boundaries. 
Ferrin did, Nordby said, noting that Ferrin used important boundaries such as I-275, the Hillsborough River, and 22nd Avenue North in St. Petersburg, a major artery, when configuring the Senate district.
Nordby acknowledged that race was a consideration, because “it had to be,” noting that to ignore that would be ignoring part of the state constitution.
Nordby also dismissed the three alternative maps drawn up for the plaintiffs by Pennsylvania State University professor of statistics Cory McCartan that keep Hillsborough and Pinellas counties separate. 
And he then addressed the peculiar situation regarding Warren, saying, “This case is an odd one.”
Nordby asserted Warren had essentially “laundered” his map through the alternative presented during the trial by McCartan. He also questioned why none of the lawmakers that plaintiff attorneys had indicated could be witnesses in the case – Sen. Darryl Rouson, House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell and most notably former Bracy, the “alleged lynchpin” for the plaintiff’s case, never showed up.
Bracy was a scheduled witness but failed to appear earlier in the week, much to the disappointment of the ACLU attorneys. When contacted by phone on Tuesday by a representative from the three-judge panel, Bracy said he hadn’t seen the subpoena until that very day and said that he had already told plaintiff attorneys that he did not intend to show up. Burgess and Rodrigues cited legislative privilege in declining to appear, according to the court.
Representing Byrd,Jazil said all of the proposed Senate maps that the ACLU had presented during the trial were examples of partisan and racial gerrymandering, and cited his text messages to House and Senate staffers involved with the reapportionment process.
  A ‘contrived kerfuffle’

In response to their closing arguments  meanwhile, Daniel Tilley, another attorney with the ACLU of Florida, noted how no lawmaker had testified. Tilley said all of the attention focused on Warren was a “contrived kerfuffle” that found no evidence to support the idea that members of the Senate were influenced by his map. It was, he surmised, a “spectacular failure.”
During the four-day trial there were hours of detailed descriptions by experts that dealt with how to draw legislative districts that were logically configured and not oddly shaped.
The Florida Senate District 16 seat is held by Rouson, who resides in St. Petersburg. Several Tampa-based constituents in the district complained earlier in the trial that he was not as accessible to meet in Hillsborough County, though defense attorneys said he has district offices in the county in Tampa and Brandon.
The three-judge panel that will decide the case includes two of them who are Trump appointees.  The panel was led by Andrew L. Brasher, who serves in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Accompanying him was U.S. Senior District Judge Charlene Edwards Honeywell and U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Barber, both of whom serve on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. Brasher and Barber were appointed by Trump during his first term as president in 2019.
If they rule in favor of the plaintiffs, their hope would be that the Florida Senate could create and approve a new map of the district in time for the 2026 election.

“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” wrote Trump, who owns a number of hotels in the U.S., including one in Las Vegas. 
“It’s a very simple thing to say, ‘we’re going to secure the border and we’re going to deport violent criminals and terrorists.’ Everybody agrees with that,” Culinary Local 226 Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said during a phone interview Thursday. “When you bring in the Marines to arrest dishwashers, that backlash is exploding in industry, among citizens and voters. If there’s one thing this president knows how to do it’s to backtrack quickly when he gets a backlash.” 
The U.S. employed more than 782,000 farm workers in 2023, according to the government. About two-thirds are immigrants, according to the government. 
The leisure and hospitality industries in the U.S. employ some 14 million people, and almost one-third are immigrants, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.
Nevada’s hospitality and leisure industries employed 368,400 people as of April, according to the Federal Reserve. 
“These industries are run by very smart people, and they understand that the immigrant workforce powers this economy,” said Pappageorge.  
Pappageorge said he’s not bothered by a carve-out from the deportation policy for two industries, suggesting agriculture and hospitality are just the first two to the table. 
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who endorsed Trump and was endorsed by Trump, did not respond to inquiries about whether he’s reached out to the White House regarding the president’s deportation plan and disruption to the labor force. 
The Nevada Resort Association, which represents casino hotels in Nevada, referred the Current to the American Hotel and Lodging Association. 
“Along with our members, we continue to communicate with Congress and the administration about the importance of building a strong hospitality and tourism workforce,” the AHLA, which represents 32,000 properties, said in a statement. “As an industry, we are committed to strict compliance with labor laws and immigration regulations, including those focused on recruitment, background checks and employment verification.”
The hospitality industry is already reeling from a precipitous drop in travel resulting from Trump’s trade wars, Bloomberg reported last week. 
“The AHLA urges Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and strengthen the H-2B visa program, which allows temporary non-agricultural work in the U.S., and the J-1 visa program, which allows participation in exchange programs,” says the AHLA website. “We believe that the United States can have both an effective and welcoming legal immigration process that enables hotels and other businesses to meet our workforce needs, while also protecting our national security.”
How Trump plans to exclude workers from the two industries from deportation is unknown. 
“They could do this by prosecutorial discretion possibly,” said Michael Kagan, director of UNLV’s Immigration Clinic. Immigrations and Customer Enforcement (ICE) has the option to close cases and allow individuals to avoid deportation.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/trump-las-vegas-hotel-jen-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Free.,‘Sanctuary city’ governors object to Trump deployment of troops into Los Angeles,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/sanctuary-city-governors-object-trump-deployment-troops-los-angeles,,"WASHINGTON — Three Democratic governors from states that leave immigration enforcement to the federal government said Thursday they oppose President Donald Trump’s decision to send more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines into Los Angeles without the consent of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.The lengthy and tense U.S. House hearing where the trio appeared — highlighted by a shouting match among members and accusations of Nazi tactics — came as the nation’s capital prepared for a major military parade and Trump’s birthday Saturday, along with thousands of “No Kings” protests across the country.In Los Angeles, a U.S. senator was tackled and removed from an immigration press conference by federal law enforcement agents accompanying Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.The governors, whose states have submitted an amicus brief to a lawsuit by Newsom challenging Trump, said the decisions to bring in the military should be made by local officials.“It's wrong to deploy the National Guard and active-duty Marines into an American city over the objection of local law enforcement, just to inflame a situation and create a crisis, just as it's wrong to tear children away from their homes and their mothers and fathers, who have spent decades living and working in our communities, raising their families,” Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois told members of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee.The hearing with Govs. Pritzker, Tim Walz of Minnesota and Kathy Hochul of New York marked the second time House Republicans have called in leaders in blue states that have policies of non-cooperation with federal immigration officials in enforcement efforts. Those policies do not bar immigration enforcement from occurring.Republicans brought in the mayors of Boston, Chicago and Denver in March.The eight-hour hearing came after multi-day protests in Los Angeles sparked when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began widespread immigration raids at Home Depots in their communities in an effort to carry out the president’s mass deportation efforts.The governors stressed that the president’s decision to send in the National Guard set a dangerous precedent and posed a threat to democracy.Republicans on the committee defended the president’s actions and instead accused the governors of violating federal law because of their state policies, dubbed as “sanctuary cities.” Immigration policy is handled by the federal government and states and localities are not required to coordinate with officials.Shouting match over NoemMore than four hours into the hearing, video circulated of California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla being forcibly removed and handcuffed by Secret Service agents while trying to ask a question of Noem during a press conference in LA.Democrats on the panel, such as Arizona Democratic Rep. Yassamin Ansari, slammed the video and raised concerns that a “sitting senator was shoved to the ground.”It led to a shouting match, with Florida Democratic Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost asking the chair of the panel, James Comer of Kentucky, if the committee would subpoena Noem.Comer said Frost was out of order and tried to move on.Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was next in line for questioning, heckled Frost and said that Democrats “can’t follow the rules.” Comer eventually told Frost to “shut up.”Pritzker said that he could not “believe the disrespect that was shown to a United States senator” who was trying to ask Noem a question.“That seems completely irrational,” Pritzker said.Democrats on the panel such as Illinois Rep. Delia Ramirez and Dan Goldman of New York called for Noem to appear before the committee.“Anyone with two eyes that can see, can see that was authoritarian, lawless behavior that no person in America, much less a senator conducting congressional oversight, should receive,” Goldman said.‘People are living in fear’The Democratic governors defended their immigration policies and criticized the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, pointing to ICE officers wearing face coverings to arrest immigrants.“People are living in fear in the shadows,” Hochul said. “People can't go to school, they can't worship, they can't go get health care. They can't go to their senior center. What is happening has been traumatic.”Several Republicans including Reps. Comer, Tom Emmer of Minnesota and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, took issue with comments by Walz at a commencement speech in May, in which he accused the president of turning ICE agents into a modern-day Gestapo, the official secret police of Nazi Germany.Republican Rep. Eric Burlison of Missouri said that Walz should apologize.Walz said that as a former history teacher, he was making an observation about ICE tactics — such as wearing a face covering to arrest people — that were similar to those used by secret police.The top Democrat on the panel, Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, defended Walz’s statement, and said that ICE is operating like a modern-day Gestapo.Lynch pointed to the video of the international Tufts University student who was approached by masked men on the street and taken into a van for writing an op-ed in defense of Palestinian human rights.  “ICE agents wearing masks and hoodies detained Rümeysa Öztürk and those of you who watched that, that abduction, when you compare the old films of the Gestapo grabbing people off the streets of Poland, and you compare them to those nondescript thugs who grabbed that student, that graduate student, it does look like a Gestapo operation,” Lynch said.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a $1 billion dollar geothermal energy generation site anticipated within the next three years. (Screengrab from live stream ) Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Thursday announced what she described as a “big damn deal” for green energy production in New Mexico, one that she said will provide Meta’s New Mexico data centers with huge amounts of green energy they need without using much water or costing taxpayers a dime. 
At a news conference at the Roundhouse, surrounded by cabinet agency heads and leaders from the Silicon Valley giant and also XGS Energy, the governor said the deal means XGS Energy would produce 150 megawatts of energy for Meta through its “advanced geothermal technology.” 
Geothermal energy taps into heat under the Earth’s surface to generate electricity using steam turbines or further uses for heating and cooling. Leaders touted the “advanced” version of that technology as a way to minimize water usage through a “closed-loop” system and also by using a tiny surface footprint, claiming only 15 acres is needed on the surface for a project that produces enough energy to power 50,000 homes. 

Read the report here. 

In addition to the energy production, the new geothermal plant will mean a $1 billion private sector investment that will create 3,000 construction jobs and 100 “really good” jobs running the geothermal power plant, the governor said. 
It’s not clear when the company will break ground on the plant or plants or where they will be located. Company leaders described at least a three-year permitting timeline. 
The governor and XGS Energy CEO Josh Prueher said New Mexico has the exact right geology to greatly expand geothermal projects. A 238-page academic report released Thursday claims the state has enough capacity to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power, which the report authors say is more than 15 times the amount of capacity the state had in 2023. 
  XGS Energy CEO Josh Prueher said New Mexico’s favorable geology and permitting landscape makes it “asy and inviting” for developers and investors, he said at a press conference Tuesday, June 12, 2025. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)
Combine the right geology with what Prueher called an easy permitting process, and then add in   an oil and gas workforce that could be trained to work in geothermal technology, and you’ve got an environment that’s “easy and inviting for developers and investors” he said. 
The governor said the state helped the deal come together through years of policy and legislative work, but stressed that no taxpayer money would be spent on it. She also said there isn’t any state agency rulemaking required or legislation that will need to pass at the upcoming legislative session. 
“This is born from all the groundwork all of us have been laying in the state, which is why, frankly, it’s a great announcement jointly, and it should be a bit of a celebration,” she said. 
The governor’s proposal is the latest she’s offered that seeks to enable continued growth while confronting the state’s arid climate, diminishing water supply and reliance on the oil and gas industry. In 2024, she announced a push for a so-called Strategic Water Supply that sought to create a market for wastewater produced by oil and gas drilling, along with brackish water. 
The state’s 50-year water plan released last year says the state can expect a 25% reduction in its water supply over the next 50 years, thanks to climate change-caused aridification. 
While leaders were tight-lipped about where the projects could go, they said the public is welcome to weigh in via the permitting process.

In a presentation elsewhere in Santa Fe as part of the release of the academic report, Melanie Kenderdine, secretary of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, showed a map that suggested the sites could be in Sandoval, San Miguel, Doña Ana, Catron and Hidalgo counties, and listed an additional 13 other counties that have “most favorable potential for other sites.”
The state aims to move forward with further projects, Kenderdine told attendees at a conference hosted by Project InnerSpace, a nonprofit pushing for further geothermal projects. 
The state has competing needs for the space underground beyond geothermal, Kenderdine said, such as sequestering carbon underground or developing geologic hydrogen as another fuel source. 
“We need to do very, very detailed mapping of the New Mexico subsurface and we need to do it quickly,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot_2025-06-12_at_4.14.18___pm_720.png,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

“These cuts are clearly problematic for our standing in the world, our leadership in the world, our security, our trade relationships,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. “But it also socks us here at home.”
Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member, hosted a forum to discuss the relationship between foreign assistance programs and the U.S. agriculture market.

Through the Food for Peace program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture facilitates purchases of American crops and partners with non-governmental organizations to distribute these surplus crops to crisis areas around the world. Under the 2026 fiscal year budget request, this program will see major cuts, which may impact American farmers, forum speakers said. Additionally, the reduction of funding to agriculture innovation labs at public universities may leave U.S. crops vulnerable to future diseases.
Cuts to innovation labs may leave U.S. crops unprepared
Dr. David Hughes, director of the USAID Innovation Lab on Current and Emerging Threats to Crops at Penn State University, said funding cuts impact his team’s ability to study potential threats to U.S. agriculture in “safe spaces” around the globe.
His innovation lab, along with the Food Safety Program at Purdue University, the Livestock Systems Program at University of Florida and Peanut Production, a program addressing malnutrition at the University of Georgia, are among the universities that will see cuts under the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE.
Hughes said his team members study threats to agriculture overseas, to “quickly deploy” mechanisms against those threats when the time comes. One threat the team is studying is thrips, a small insect that poses a risk to the U.S. floral industry. His team uses a space in Nepal to reduce risk to local crops.
Additionally, Hughes and his team at Penn State have been developing an artificial intelligence system called PlantVillage which provides advice to help farmers cope with climate change to increase the yield and profitability of their crops.
He says many American and European scientists are “decamping” to China because they fill a space of “research excellence” left by cuts to research in the United States.
“You want to make sure if you do have an AI system giving knowledge to American farmers, you better be sure it’s not a made-in-China system.” Hughes said.
Farmers benefit from USDA purchase of surplus
“To be able to count on that institutional market that comes from food assistance is a significant benefit to the U.S. farmer,” said Thoric Cederstrom, International Food Aid representative on the U.S. Dry Bean Council.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Cederstrom said he doesn’t think there is any organization that “stands ready to fill that void,” left by USAID. He argues there is “enlightened self-interest” in the purchase of American crops from farmers to be used as aid abroad. This purchase helps in “stabilizing demand and prices for farmers across the heartland” and “offset the risk of unpredictable market, trade disruptions and climate variability.” The USAID programs create a market that farms can respond to to turn a profit and “generate income that keeps their businesses active.”
Cuts to USDA Inspection Service leave Americans vulnerable to disease
“There couldn’t be a worse time to lower our guard,” said Kevin Shea, former administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA. “African swine fever in the Dominican Republic, very close to our shores, very easily just one trip away from getting here. That’s just one example. Foot and mouth disease, eradicated a century ago in America, is now appearing all around the world for the first time in many, many years. Another big concern for us. And screwworm has breached the barrier in Panama for many years and has made it into Mexico.”
Shea says that the inspection service has lost nearly 1,300 or around 15% of the workforce has left “in the past few months”  and with the additional cuts under the FY26 budget request “APHIS can not do its job.”
Both Hughes and Shea talked about citrus greening disease, which has impacted the citrus industry in Florida as an example of the need for research and inspection programs.
USAID career staff unable to move current stock to areas in need
Sarah Charles, former assistant to the administrator of USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said despite the cuts, the career staff left at USAID are working “furiously” to move food kept in warehouses around that globe, “even knowing they have been fired,” to areas in need.
She also said the U.S. government response to crises, such as the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, has been “limited” because the capacity has been “taken offline by the Trump administration.”
China showed up in a major capacity, but many of its outreach programs are through the government, so the networks built by the U.S. with non-governmental partners and civil society organizations have been “abandoned,” Charles said.
“Food rations that could supply three and a half million people for a month are rotting in warehouses around the world because of USAID cuts,”  Shaheen said. “Sadly, people are going hungry while farmers are losing a critical buyer for their crops.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Families and educators at Epic Charter School now face a summer of uncertainty as the charter school system downsizes its staff, facilities and course offerings.
A leadership change and a state investigation have piled on top of the cuts. The virtual charter school’s superintendent, Bart Banfield, resigned Monday, days after Epic laid off 357 teachers and administrators. Its deputy superintendent of finance, Jeanise Wynn, resigned April 11.
“There hasn’t been much transparency about why and what are we doing,” Epic teacher and parent Sarah Kitterman said. “What actions are we taking to make sure this changes and we don’t do this again?”
Kitterman, of Edmond, said Epic lost programs that were difference-makers for students. Her own children benefited from a now-eliminated ELA+ program that offered bonus reading classes. 
Students won’t get that extra English language arts instruction without the program, she said, and it’s unclear how Epic will repeat the “incredible” learning gains that ELA+ produced. A similar Math+ program has been reduced to grades 6-12 only.

The closure of Epic’s Blended Learning Centers is a loss, too, Kitterman said. The centers, which offered in-person instruction in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, often had waiting lists.
Students with disabilities especially sought a place at the learning centers, said Kitterman, a special education teacher.
“Does that mean that we’re going to have an overload of students on our rosters now?” she said. “We can’t serve those students the same way that they were being served. So where do those students go?”
Epic announced it would give students from the learning centers priority in another face-to-face instructional option, Comet Academy.
Also gone are Epic’s options for full-time in-person instruction five days a week, its school meal services, and all of its Chinese and Latin courses. Other services, like Advanced Placement courses, have been outsourced to other entities, some now costing a fee.
“These changes are part of our ongoing reorganization to better serve the 30,000 students statewide who choose Epic for their education, and to position the state’s largest public virtual charter school for strength and success in the years to come,” the school told families in an email last week.

Members of Epic’s school board spoke little of the school’s financial situation Thursday in their first meeting since the layoffs and Banfield’s departure. The board, which is scheduled to meet again Tuesday, approved a new treasurer, assistant treasurer and encumbrance clerk for Epic, who will join the new chief financial officer, Michael Flory.
The school board has yet to approve a budget for the 2025-26 school year, which must be done before the next fiscal year begins on July 1. 
The Statewide Charter School Board, a state agency that oversees Epic, is now investigating the school’s finances.
After its enrollment skyrocketed to over 60,000 children in 2020, Epic has steadily lost students and, as a result, state funding. An influx of federal pandemic aid funds also came to an end in September.
To make matters worse, Epic administrators significantly miscalculated when crafting their budget for the 2024-25 academic year. Enrollment came in 4,000 students short of what administrators expected, prompting a round of layoffs in October that cost 144 jobs.
The cuts continued this month when Epic slashed 83 teaching positions and 274 administrators.
Banfield soon followed out the door.
“At Epic, we often say, ‘The only constant is change,’” Banfield wrote in his resignation letter, which Oklahoma Voice obtained. “Over the course of this school year, it has become clear to me that it is time for a new chapter. With deep gratitude, I am formally submitting my resignation. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Board of Education, the Epic staff, and most importantly, the hundreds of thousands of families who have chosen Epic as their school of choice since 2011. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve you over the past 11 years. I wish you the very best. Go Comets!”
Deputy Superintendent of Instruction Justin Hunt will serve as interim superintendent while the board searches for a candidate to hire permanently.

“I appreciate the trust and respect, and (I’m) looking forward to moving into next school year for the 30,000 kids that need us and choose us as a school option,” Hunt said during Thursday’s school board meeting.
As for Kitterman, she plans to return for her fourth school year teaching at Epic, and her three children will continue to attend, she said. Until this point, Kitterman has felt like a valued employee, she said, but the lack of transparency around the layoffs and cuts put that sense of value in doubt.
“I plan to stay as long as Epic is open,” Kitterman said. “We’ve loved it, so that’s my hope. It’s just so scary.”

(Jordan Gale/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A “historic” deal made two years ago between the U.S. government, four tribes, Northwest states and environmentalists to put legal battles aside and invest in restoring endangered Columbia River fish runs is now off.
President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a presidential memorandum withdrawing the U.S. government from a Dec. 14, 2023 agreement to help restore salmon, steelhead and other native fish being decimated by federal hydroelectric dams in the Columbia River Basin. The memorandum refers to  the commitments as “onerous,” “misguided” and as placing “concerns about climate change above the nation’s interests in reliable energy resources.”
The 2023 agreement was reached after decades of legal battles that pitted the federal government against four Lower Columbia River tribes and environmental groups backed by the states of Oregon and Washington.
Groups behind the suits said they would forge on, and legal battles will likely reopen.
“This move by the Trump administration to throw away five years’ worth of progress is shortsighted and reckless,” said Mitch Cutter, a salmon and energy strategist at the Idaho Conservation League, in a statement. “The Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement was a landmark achievement between the federal government, states, Tribes and salmon advocates to find solutions for salmon and stay out of the courtroom. Now, it’s gone thanks to the uninformed impulses of a disconnected administration that doesn’t understand the Pacific Northwest and the rivers and fish that make our region special.”
The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon and the Nez Perce Tribe were part of the deal. In negotiations, the tribes, along with the states of Oregon and Washington, are referred to as the “six sovereigns.”
Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek’s office.
Shannon Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe, said in a statement that Trump’s decision is a denial of the truth.
“This action tries to hide from the truth. The Nez Perce Tribe holds a duty to speak the truth for the salmon, and the truth is that extinction of salmon populations is happening now,” he said. “People across the Northwest know this, and people across the nation have supported us in a vision for preventing salmon extinction that would at the same time create a stronger and better future for the Northwest. This remains the shared vision of the states of Washington and Oregon, and the Yakama, Umatilla, Warm Springs and Nez Perce tribes, as set out in our Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative.”
Groups representing utilities, farmers, ports and others who rely on Columbia River dams for power, moving goods and irrigation, celebrated the executive order.
“As demand for electricity surges across the nation, preserving access to always-available energy resources like hydropower is absolutely crucial,” said Jim Matheson, CEO of the trade group National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, in a news release.
Reaction from Washington’s congressional delegation split along partisan lines.
U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican who represents central Washington, applauded Trump’s move, saying it “reverses the efforts by the Biden administration and extreme environmental activists to remove the dams, which would have threatened the reliability of our power grid, raised energy prices, and decimated our ability to export grain to foreign markets.”
Washington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, called the president’s action “grievously wrong” and shortsighted.
“This was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to modernize infrastructure across the Columbia River Basin, support reliable clean energy, and save imperiled salmon and steelhead runs,” Murray said in a statement. “The Trump administration’s senseless decision to tear it up is a betrayal of our Tribes and a tremendous setback for the entire Northwest.”
 Nearing extinction

At the heart of the issue are four Snake River dams that provide irrigation and emissions-free hydropower for nearby communities, but have also contributed to the near extinction of 13 salmon and steelhead populations that return to the Columbia Basin from the Pacific Ocean to spawn. The fish are important to tribal health and sovereignty and to basin ecosystems, and the declines are hitting southern resident orcas off the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon that rely on salmon for food and that are federally listed as endangered.
Environmental advocates, tribes and others have pushed to remove the four dams – Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite on the Snake River between Kennewick, Wash., and Lewiston, Idaho – to help the fish, including filing lawsuits. Earthjustice, an environmental law group, has led litigation against five federal agencies, seeking changes to dam operations in the Columbia River Basin to help protect salmon.
The 2023 agreement, coupled with Biden-era climate and clean energy funding, was meant to pour more than $1 billion in new federal investments for wild fish restoration into the Columbia River Basin over the next decade, along with clean energy projects on tribal lands. It also included potentially breaching the four Snake River Dams to restore natural flows that could revive native salmon populations.
Earthjustice Attorney Amanda Goodin said in a statement that they would not give up fighting in court to prevent salmon extinction in the Columbia River Basin.
“The Trump administration is turning its back on an unprecedented opportunity to support a thriving Columbia Basin — and ignoring the extinction crisis facing our salmon,” she said. “Unfortunately, this short-sighted decision to renege on this important agreement is just the latest in a series of anti-government and anti-science actions coming from the Trump administration.”
Correction: a previous version of the story incorrectly said Trump’s presidential memorandum also revoked another September 2023 presidential memorandum signed by former President Joe Biden meant to send Northwest tribes funding for salmon reintroduction.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Appreciation for South County’s acclaimed Matunuck Oyster Bar transcends political party, evidenced by the Rhode Island General Assembly’s universal support to change state outdoor dining regulations on the restaurant’s behalf.
Companion bills sponsored by South Kingstown Democrats, Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee and Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski were each approved by their respective chambers in separate, unanimous votes Thursday. 
Each chamber must still give the rubber stamp to the other’s bill — a process known as concurrence — before the legislation heads to Gov. Dan McKee’s desk. McKee has already indicated his support.
The eleventh hour proposal, introduced in the Rhode Island State House one week earlier, offers a temporary solution after a fire permanently closed Matunuck Oyster Bar on May 20.
Perry Raso, restaurant owner and oyster farmer, has cooked up a plan to host diners in a neighboring marina parking lot this summer, which requires a few tweaks to existing state regulations governing al fresco eateries.
“While we know summer at Matunuck Oyster Bar won’t look the same this year, this creative solution is a great first step toward welcoming diners back to our tables and keeping our staff working and earning wages during this busy season,” Raso said in a statement Thursday prior to the votes.
Raso said he can keep about 50 members of his 300-person staff on the payroll this summer under the mobile kitchen plan.

“This bill is not only about outdoor dining, it’s about protecting jobs, supporting small business and keeping our economy going,” said Rep. Kathleen Fogarty, a South Kingstown Democrat whose district includes the restaurant and Raso’s home.
Outdoor dining is no longer a novelty, having become a staple for the state’s hospitality industry in the wake of the pandemic. In February 2024, lawmakers approved a new state law regulating outdoor dining, allowing cities and towns to limit outdoor dining on public property and set capacity caps, while protecting restaurant owners from overly restrictive local limits on operating hours and parking.
The bill passed by both chambers Thursday amends the 2024 law, permitting 18 months of outdoor dining — or until the building is “fit for occupancy” — for restaurants closed due to casualties like floods and fires. Municipal governments would also need to OK the workaround measure for affected restaurants in their communities based on existing local ordinances. Restaurants could serve alcohol outside, too, if they already have a local liquor license.
The added flexibility for outdoor dining in emergencies expires June 30, 2027, though Senator Leonidas Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat, urged fellow senators to consider making the change permanent.  
“I think this is a very good tool that helps all businesses in Rhode Island,” Raptakis, who used to own Venus Pizza in Coventry. “I don’t want to see this happen to any business.”
Across the rotunda, Minority Whip David Place,a Burrillville Republican, lobbied unsuccessfully to make the proposal permanent.
 “I don’t want this to just be here for one business, I want it to be here for every business,” Place said.
McEntee, however, said the sunset provision aligned with prior, pandemic-era outdoor dining laws, which all began as temporary measures and, if proven effective, became permanent.
Place ultimately voted for the legislation as presented, including the 2027 expiration.
The South Kingstown Town Council passed a resolution at its June 9 meeting supporting the state policy change, as requested by Elizabeth Noonan, an attorney representing Raso. 
The South Kingstown Town Council must also approve details of Raso’s outdoor dining plans, which had not been submitted to the town as of Thursday afternoon, Town Council President Rory McEntee. He is the son of Rep. McEntee.
“We look forward to sharing our plans for al fresco dining in the marina parking lot across the street from the Matunuck Oyster Bar if and when this legislation is enacted, and we remain committed to take any step we can to preserve as many summer shifts for as many of our employees as possible,” Raso said Thursday.
Details on a permanent rebuild and reopening of the famed, 16-year seafood restaurant were not immediately available.
The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Rhode Island Office of the State Fire Marshal, Matt Touchette, a spokesperson, said Thursday. A preliminary investigation suggested it was accidental, and not caused by commercial cooking equipment.
Rep. Megan Cotter, an Exeter Democrat, recused herself from the vote. Cotter sold the restaurant fish through her job as director of business development and category management for Foley Fish, she said via text Thursday night.

Through the Food for Peace program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture facilitates purchases of American crops and partners with non-governmental organizations to distribute these surplus crops to crisis areas around the world. Under the 2026 fiscal year budget request, this program will see major cuts, which may impact American farmers, forum speakers said. Additionally, the reduction of funding to agriculture innovation labs at public universities may leave U.S. crops vulnerable to future diseases.
Cuts to innovation labs may leave U.S. crops unprepared
Dr. David Hughes, director of the USAID Innovation Lab on Current and Emerging Threats to Crops at Penn State University, said funding cuts impact his team’s ability to study potential threats to U.S. agriculture in “safe spaces” around the globe.
His innovation lab, along with the Food Safety Program at Purdue University, the Livestock Systems Program at University of Florida and Peanut Production, a program addressing malnutrition at the University of Georgia, are among the universities that will see cuts under the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE.
Hughes said his team members study threats to agriculture overseas, to “quickly deploy” mechanisms against those threats when the time comes. One threat the team is studying is thrips, a small insect that poses a risk to the U.S. floral industry. His team uses a space in Nepal to reduce risk to local crops. 
Additionally, Hughes and his team at Penn State have been developing an artificial intelligence system called PlantVillage which provides advice to help farmers cope with climate change to increase the yield and profitability of their crops. 
He says many American and European scientists are “decamping” to China because they fill a space of “research excellence” left by cuts to research in the United States. 
“You want to make sure if you do have an AI system giving knowledge to American farmers, you better be sure it’s not a made-in-China system.” Hughes said. 
Farmers benefit from USDA purchase of surplus
“To be able to count on that institutional market that comes from food assistance is a significant benefit to the U.S. farmer,” said Thoric Cederstrom, International Food Aid representative on the U.S. Dry Bean Council. 
Cederstrom said he doesn’t think there is any organization that “stands ready to fill that void,” left by USAID. He argues there is “enlightened self-interest” in the purchase of American crops from farmers to be used as aid abroad. This purchase helps in “stabilizing demand and prices for farmers across the heartland” and “offset the risk of unpredictable market, trade disruptions and climate variability.” The USAID programs create a market that farms can respond to to turn a profit and “generate income that keeps their businesses active.” 
Cuts to USDA Inspection Service leave Americans vulnerable to disease
“There couldn’t be a worse time to lower our guard,” said Kevin Shea, former administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA. “African swine fever in the Dominican Republic, very close to our shores, very easily just one trip away from getting here. That’s just one example. Foot and mouth disease, eradicated a century ago in America, is now appearing all around the world for the first time in many, many years. Another big concern for us. And screwworm has breached the barrier in Panama for many years and has made it into Mexico.” 
Shea says that the inspection service has lost nearly 1,300 or around 15% of the workforce has left “in the past few months”  and with the additional cuts under the FY26 budget request “APHIS can not do its job.”
Both Hughes and Shea talked about citrus greening disease, which has impacted the citrus industry in Florida as an example of the need for research and inspection programs. 
USAID career staff unable to move current stock to areas in need
Sarah Charles, former assistant to the administrator of USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said despite the cuts, the career staff left at USAID are working “furiously” to move food kept in warehouses around that globe, “even knowing they have been fired,” to areas in need. 
She also said the U.S. government response to crises, such as the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, has been “limited” because the capacity has been “taken offline by the Trump administration.” 
China showed up in a major capacity, but many of its outreach programs are through the government, so the networks built by the U.S. with non-governmental partners and civil society organizations have been “abandoned,” Charles said.
“Food rations that could supply three and a half million people for a month are rotting in warehouses around the world because of USAID cuts,”  Shaheen said. “Sadly, people are going hungry while farmers are losing a critical buyer for their crops.”

“I would love to encourage our producers of our spirits to get their products, get what they need, their supplies here in the state. Let’s encourage it,” said Assemblywoman Andrea Katz (D-Burlington). 
The Jersey Fresh program began in the 1980s to inform consumers about produce grown in the state and promote buying from local businesses. In order for farmers to use a Jersey Fresh logo, they must show they meet U.S. Department of Agriculture standards and the USDA can conduct regular inspections. 
Under the bill, a beverage should be made with at least 51% of in-state produce — like potatoes for vodka or barley for beer — to qualify for the Jersey Fresh designation. 
Farmer John Hart told the committee the legislation would help small farms promote their products and bring farmers into another industry. 
While Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia (R-Sussex) called the bill a step in the right direction, she said that threshold is too high for businesses in New Jersey — home to harsh winters. She said she’s heard from distilleries and breweries who find it’s hard to source products year-round to meet Jersey Fresh standards.  
“In off-season, we might be importing grapes in, so unless we’re counting the water as being sourced in New Jersey, I think the 51% is too high of a standard,” Fantasia said.  
Katz said the standard is set by the agricultural industry. And the idea behind the bill was borne out of a New Jersey agricultural convention where none of the spirits had Jersey labeling on them. 
“It’s just a little bit of a unique label on that to show us that it’s from New Jersey, and hopefully it will grow,” said Katz. 
Members of the Assembly Commerce, Economic Development and Agriculture Committee passed the bill by a 7-2 vote, with one abstention from Fantasia. The measure, introduced last month, does not yet have a Senate companion.

[…]","The New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy in Santa Fe on June 14, 2023. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The New Mexico Law Enforcement Certification Board will ask the state Department of Justice to weigh in on whether it can accept police misconduct complaints filed by citizens.
At the opening of the board’s regular meeting on Thursday morning, Vice Chair Cody Rogers Benavidez said it will formally request a legal opinion from the department.
The board’s decision follows a petition backed by state legislators and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico that asks the board to adopt new rules, including ones that will address the issue of citizen complaints.
With some limited exceptions, New Mexico state agencies must adopt rules, also known as regulations or standards, which are used to actually carry out laws passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor.
However, the Law Enforcement Certification Board has been operating under rules that predate its existence for nearly two years, and which don’t address whether the board can hear citizen complaints.
Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque), who carried the 2023 legislation that created the board, also noted during the meeting his hope that the board “moves forward with rulemaking.” The law creating the board requires the board to adopt new rules.
Maestas also said during public comment that police officers and sheriff’s deputies are government employees and should be open to scrutiny like any other professionals licensed by the state government.
“Anybody can file a complaint with regards to that profession, and the board can treat it accordingly,” he said.
Rogers Benavidez said NMDOJ is also helping the board write the new rules.
“We’re going to move forward with rulemaking and hopefully have something ready to go relatively soon,” she said. “Rulemaking is happening, it is underway and we will have drafts and other things to look at in the near future. It’s a priority for us, it’s a priority for the community, it’s a priority for everybody. So that’s not lost on us.”

What exactly those rules will say about police misconduct complaints also factors into the petition filed with the board. 
“Until the LECB can operate as an independent body without conflict of interest, and until it clarifies its responsibility for all law enforcement licenses in New Mexico regardless of rank or agency, there will be no legitimate investigation or adjudication of law enforcement misconduct in New Mexico,” the petition states.
Rachel Feldman, chair of the Indivisible SOS Santa Fe’s Civil Rights & Law Enforcement Reform Committee, filed the petition on May 15, following her own misconduct complaint in January against Department of Public Safety Secretary Jason Bowie, which accused him of taking over the board’s staff and gaining access to their confidential files, making it impossible for them to impartially investigate police misconduct complaints.
Last February, Bowie — who has denied the allegations — told the board that accepting the complaint as an official police misconduct filing would “set a dangerous precedent,” and predicted legal challenges from police associations.
Christopher Williams, Portales Police Department chief and New Mexico Police Chiefs Association vice president, told the board that municipal police chiefs oppose allowing citizens to file misconduct complaints because they are already held accountable through other means.
“The accountability is there,” Williams said. “Our municipalities have put us in the positions to run the agencies, and if we’re not doing that, people can reflect that to our councils, commissions, mayor, city manager, whichever form of government we operate under, to take the necessary steps to hold us, as the agency heads, accountable.”
Other state lawmakers and organizations back the petition, however.
Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) in a June 1 letter to the board argues that pressure on the board members to not fully act on civilian complaints undermines the law’s intent and public trust in institutions.
“Civilian oversight is not a threat to law enforcement — it is an essential element of a healthy democracy,” Romero wrote. “To suggest otherwise is to disregard the very principles of accountability and public service that our laws are meant to uphold.”
Romero had asked the board to put the petition on the agenda for Thursday’s meeting; however, it did not. Feldman said during public comment she received a letter at the end of the day on Wednesday indicating the board wouldn’t consider the petition.
ACLU-NM Executive Director Leon Howard also wrote a letter to the board on May 27 endorsing Feldman’s petition, in which he argued they should rigorously investigate allegations of misconduct, regardless of their source.
“Constraining members of the public from reporting alleged misconduct to the Board does not serve the public interest,” Howard wrote. “We urge the Board to adopt rules that allow for investigating and acting upon any report of alleged misconduct.”

She and her colleagues carried out this work in defiance of the federal government. And her efforts to accelerate the pandemic response later earned her a “Washingtonian of the Year” award from a state leadership board.
After a two-year vetting process, the University of Washington scientist landed a spot last year on the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s influential panel of vaccine experts.
But on Monday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired Chu and the 16 other members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
“I really worry about the health and safety of people in our country and the future of our public health infrastructure,” Chu told reporters Thursday in a call with U.S. Sen. Patty Murray.

Kennedy said he wanted to restore trust in a panel he believed was rife with conflicts of interest.
And on Wednesday, he named eight replacement members, including several with track records criticizing vaccines. 
Kennedy himself has a history of promoting skepticism and unfounded theories about vaccines.
He came to Olympia in 2019, for example, to advocate against legislation that would have made it harder for parents to opt their children out of the measles, mumps and rubella shot in the middle of a measles outbreak.
The medical field largely condemned this week’s firings.
For over 60 years, the committee has reviewed vaccine efficacy and recommended who should receive which shots. The guidance goes to the CDC director, who usually follows the group’s decisions. These recommendations impact what vaccines insurers will cover, as opposed to forcing patients to pay out of pocket.
Members typically serve four-year terms. 
The purge comes on the heels of Kennedy announcing unilaterally that federal health officials would stop recommending COVID vaccines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.
The federal panel is set to meet later this month, with recommendation votes scheduled for several vaccines, including for coronavirus.
“RFK Jr is not just crossing a red line for public health,” said Murray, a Democrat from Washington. “He is sprinting into dangerous, uncharted territory in support of totally deranged conspiracies, and he is dragging us all along with him.”
‘Gold standard’
Chu used the example of a vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, to show the importance of the committee’s work, and that it’s not just a rubber stamp for immunizations.
When reviewing data on the proposed vaccine, the panel found a risk of the rare neurological disorder known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome. So Chu, an infectious diseases professor at the UW, and her fellow members decided to recommend the shot only for older adults at a higher risk of getting severe symptoms from RSV.
“I think this example really illustrates the approach that the ACIP takes, that what we do is rooted in science, and that the decisions we make do not necessarily benefit the companies that have invested heavily to develop these vaccines,” Chu said. “As a result, ACIP is widely regarded as an international gold standard for vaccine decision making.”
Lacking trust in the committee’s potential recommendations, Chu advised doctors to turn to groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology for science-based vaccine guidance.
She worries that turning the previously “independent, unbiased” committee into something driven by “one person’s beliefs,” Americans will lose trust in national vaccine policy. This could lead to a patchwork of policies that differ state to state, Chu said.

Mike Lee, R-Utah, (right) participates in a forum hosted by the Sutherland Institute at the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics on Oct. 14, 2024. (Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is bringing back a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Utah and other Western states, including Idaho.
Lee says it will open up “underused” federal land for housing and help communities manage growth. Opponents, including a number of Democrats in Congress and environmental groups, say it’s an attempt to pay for tax cuts and warn it will jeopardize access to public lands.
More than 100 environmental groups sign letter opposing return of public lands sale

Introduced Wednesday evening, Lee’s amendment to congressional Republicans’ budget bill, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill,” renews an effort initially spearheaded by U.S. Reps. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, and Mark Amodei, R-Nevada, that sought to dispose of 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah and some 450,000 acres of federal land in Nevada.
But Lee’s proposal is much broader — rather than earmark specific parcels of land for disposal like Maloy and Amodei’s amendment, Lee wants to require the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture to sell off a percentage of land managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
Idaho is among the states included in Lee’s proposal.

“How out of touch do you have to be to think our public lands should be sold off to pay for billionaire tax breaks?” Idaho Democratic Party Chairwoman Lauren Necochea said in an emailed statement on Thursday. “This shameless scheme would force the sale of millions of acres, including land right here in Idaho. These are the places Idahoans hunt, fish, hike, and pass down to the next generation.”
Necochea slammed Idaho’s U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo, both Republicans, for voting on April 7 in opposition to the “Public Lands in Public Hands Act” bill amendment. That amendment would have blocked the sale of public lands to help pay for the Republicans’ budget reconciliation proposals. U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, also voted against the amendment. The only member of Idaho’s congressional delegation to vote in favor of of the amendment to protect public lands from sale was U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, also a Republican.
“Now the bill heads to the committee Risch sits on, and if his record tells us anything, he’ll side with the billionaires again,” Necochea stated. “Idahoans have made it clear: our public lands are not for sale. If Risch and Crapo keep siding with out-of-state developers and mega-donors, we’ll make sure they have plenty of time to enjoy the lands they refused to protect.”
 Utah senator’s proposal would require federal agencies to sell up to 3.3. million acres of public land

According to Lee’s new amendment, the U.S. Forest Service and the BLM would be required to dispose of between 0.5% to 0.75% of land they manage, which amounts to about 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. State and local governments would be allowed to nominate parcels of land, and would be granted priority to purchase.
Eleven states would be eligible — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Notably, Montana is exempt, and Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke was instrumental in sinking Maloy and Amodei’s original proposal, stating that selling public lands is a line he would not cross.
Though the scope is much bigger, Lee’s reasoning behind the proposal is the same as Maloy and Amodei’s: identify parcels of federal land near high-growth areas, and sell them at market value to local governments to use for housing, water infrastructure, roads and other development.
The amendment prohibits the sale of land that’s already designated, like national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas or national recreation areas. Land that has an existing right, like a mining claim, grazing permit, mineral lease or right of way is also off limits.
If it passes, the secretaries of the departments of Interior and Agriculture would have to prioritize nominating land that’s next to already developed areas, has access to existing infrastructure or is “suitable for residential housing.” The amendment also directs the secretaries to nominate land that’s isolated and “inefficient to manage,” and to reduce the checkerboard land pattern, the result of railroad grants in the 1800s that left small plots of private land scattered within swaths of federal land and vice-versa.
“We’re opening underused federal land to expand housing, support local development and get Washington, D.C., out of the way for communities that are just trying to grow,” Lee said in a video address. “We’re talking about isolated parcels that are difficult to manage, that are better suited for housing and infrastructure. To our hunters, anglers and sportsmen, you will not lose access to the lands you love. Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Environmental groups decry Lee’s public lands proposal

But that reasoning didn’t fly for a number of environmental groups, including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, which called Lee’s proposal an attempt “to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”
“Senator Lee’s never-ending attacks on public lands continue. His hostility stands in stark contrast with Americans’ deep and abiding love of public lands. Senator Lee’s plan puts Utah’s redrock country in the crosshairs of unchecked development,” said Travis Hammill, Washington, D.C., director for the alliance. “In Utah and the West, public lands are the envy of the country — but Senator Lee is willing to sacrifice the places where people recreate, where they hunt and fish, and where they make a living.”
Long-thwarted efforts to sell public lands see new life under Trump

The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, called Lee’s amendment “a shameless ploy to sell off pristine public lands for trophy homes and gated communities that will do nothing to address the affordable housing shortage in the West”; the National Wildlife Federation dubbed it a “fire sale” that is “orders of magnitude worse” than Maloy’s proposal; The Wilderness Society said it was “a betrayal of future generations and folks on both sides of the aisle” and warned that could spark political backlash.
Maloy’s proposal identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Utah’s Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George. The land would have been used for water infrastructure (like reservoirs and wells), an airport expansion in St. George, new and widened roads, recreation and housing.
The proposal was widely celebrated by the water district and local governments, who said it would help them make adjustments as the region continues to experience rapid growth. But nearby tribes, environmentalists and politicians from both sides of the aisle were skeptical.
The Greater Yellowstone Coalition on Thursday said in a press release that it is calling on Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming U.S. senators to stand up and speak out against Lee’s proposal.
“Public lands belong to all Americans and are vitally important to the communities of Greater Yellowstone and other iconic western landscapes,” said Greater Yellowstone Coalition Executive Director Scott Christensen in the press release. “Our national public lands are not a luxury, they’re our legacy. These are outdoor spaces that connect us to each other, fuel the economies of western states, and provide clean drinking water to millions of Americans downstream. Once these lands are sold off, they’re gone forever.”

Gov. Phil Scott this week signed two significant pieces of health care legislation into law, both of which seek to rein in health care costs while bolstering state oversight of hospital practices.
One bill, H.266, signed on Wednesday, limits the amount that Vermont health care providers can charge for outpatient prescription drugs — medications administered by injection or IV that are often used to treat cancers and autoimmune diseases.
Another, S.126, signed Thursday, aims at a more comprehensive, long-term transformation of health care regulation in the state. Among other items, the bill requires state health care officials to develop a “statewide health care delivery plan” and present it to the Legislature by 2028. The legislation also directs the Green Mountain Care Board to implement reference-based pricing, a system that tethers the prices that health care providers charge to the equivalent rates that Medicare allows. 
Taken together, the two pieces of legislation represent a major effort by Vermont lawmakers and officials to curb health care costs while bolstering oversight of hospitals. 
The passage of the bills comes at a time when many health care entities in the state are struggling to stay afloat while patients and employers are facing skyrocketing insurance premiums.
“We have no choice,” Mike Fisher, Vermont’s chief health care advocate, said Thursday. “There’s a substantial risk that we’re going to lose key providers in communities around the state if we don’t intervene.”

‘The most consequential and immediate effort’
Among the main contributors to ballooning health care costs in Vermont are the extreme markups that hospitals charge for certain drugs, lawmakers and officials have said.
Currently, the average price of outpatient pharmaceuticals in the state are more than five times the amount of the manufacturer’s average sales price, by far the highest average markup in the nation, according to data compiled by the research and consulting firm RAND. 
H.266 caps the cost of those drugs at 120% of their manufacturers’ average sale price beginning in January 2026, a move that health officials say will go a long way toward immediately lowering Vermont’s rising insurance premiums and health care expenditures. 
Under the new cap, outpatient drug prices at Vermont hospitals would be the lowest in the nation, according to preliminary estimates. Hospitals in the state designated federally as “critical access hospitals” are exempt from the cap if they are not affiliated with a larger hospital network. That group of six hospitals not covered by the cap includes Copley Hospital in Morrisville, Gifford Medical Center in Randolph and North Country Hospital in Newport.
“It is the most consequential and immediate effort I have heard of to reduce health care costs in the state,” Owen Foster, chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, said Thursday.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, the state’s largest health insurance provider, has already said the measure would reduce the insurer’s projected rate of premium increases for next year by an estimated four percentage points for plans offered on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, and by three percentage points for public school employees.
But advocates for the state’s hospitals argue that the proposal would take away millions of dollars of revenue, requiring some health care providers to drastically tighten their belts and potentially cut staff and services.
“As we do this work, we’ll first ensure we look to administrative and other savings to limit and avoid, to the fullest extent possible, impacts on direct patient care and services,” Devon Green, a lobbyist for the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Care Systems, said in a written statement. “We know this will be challenging, but if we work with our state partners, the GMCB and together as hospitals, we are confident we can make meaningful progress.”

‘A significant amount of work to do’
Lawmakers and officials are looking to rein in hospital prices in the longer term with S.126, which requires the Green Mountain Care Board to establish a reference-based pricing system for the state’s hospitals by 2027.
Under the proposed model, the Green Mountain Care Board will limit the amount that hospitals charge private insurance companies for patient procedures by pegging those prices to the equivalent rates that Medicare sets for hospitals. 
State officials have long trumpeted reference-based pricing as a means of clamping down on rising health care costs.
A 2024 report produced by the care board found that implementing the cost saving system just for state and school employee insurance plans could save the state tens of millions of dollars annually. Doug Hoffer, the state auditor, similarly touted reference-based pricing as a cost-saving measure for the state’s health care system in a 2021 report. 
In practice, the measure represents a seismic shift in the way that hospitals price patient care, and it remains unclear exactly how the pricing system would work.
“There’s a significant amount of work to do to come up with a payment methodology for reference-based pricing,” Foster said. “All of these things are going to take a fair amount of time and effort to get it right, and so that’s what we’re initiating.”
S.126 also tasks state officials with transitioning the state’s health care system to a “global budget” payment model by 2030, meaning participating hospitals would receive fixed amounts of money from participating insurers to operate within a given year rather than receiving separate payments for individual procedures. 
Vermont already took steps in the direction of establishing a global budget model when, earlier this year, it signed onto a pilot program run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services called the AHEAD model. The pilot program, if it moves forward, would allow the state to incorporate federally funded insurers into the payment system. 
Additionally, the bill would give state regulators more general oversight of health care providers, allowing the Green Mountain Care Board to collect more data and financial information from hospitals for the sake of standardizing pricing and budgets.
Last week, Scott also signed into law H.482, legislation that gives the Green Mountain Care Board emergency authority to reduce hospital prices in the case of risks of insolvency to insurers. 
“It just provides a layer of protection for the entire system,” Foster said. “I see that as a critical step in the situation that we’re in, with financial concerns at our primary insurer.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Although the vast majority of attention has been directed towards Washington D.C. for the upcoming weekend, the Philadelphia region will be hosting a three-day celebration to mark the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday.
The Army was founded in Philadelphia.
Erica Liermann, a retired U.S. Army staff sergeant, is the director of Marketing and Communications for the Association of the U.S. Army (AUSA) Penn and Franklin Chapters, a non-profit organization.
She said that the weekend is an opportunity to “celebrate our heritage” and focus on the history that the city has to offer.
“This event is not political,” Liermann said during a joint informational meeting of the state House and Senate Veterans Affairs & Emergency Preparedness committees.
The gathering kicks off on Friday afternoon in Valley Forge and includes a guided tour of the Washington Memorial Chapel, a Medal of Honor Grove tour and wreath laying ceremony. Both are free and open to the public. The final event of the evening will be a cocktail reception that is a ticketed event.
The bulk of the celebration will take place on Saturday in Philadelphia. It begins in the morning with an opening ceremony at Independence Mall that includes a flag-raising ceremony, the national anthem, and remarks from elected officials and military leaders.
A brief military and civilian parade will be held in the early afternoon that features service members, veteran groups, re-enactors, marching bands, and SOCOM Para-Commando Parachute Demonstration. An enlistment ceremony will take place later in the afternoon that will feature 250 new soldiers taking their oath, followed by an Army Field Band Concert.
“We are just turning the city into a party hall,” Liermann said. “We want everyone to consider everybody family. Everyone is welcome to join, to bring anybody.”
Liermann emphasized that these events, which are free and open to the public, will be family friendly and include rock walls. She also said there will be military and armored vehicles on display, although they will not be rolling down the street.
On Saturday evening, an invitation-only gathering will take place at the 1st City Troop Armory in Philadelphia.
The events wrap up on Sunday morning in Philadelphia with a church service at Christ Church, which will include remarks from the former Under Secretary of the U.S. Army Patrick Murphy, who represented a Bucks County-based district in the U.S. House from 2007-2011. Following mass, there will be a George Washington Commissioning Reenactment on the north side of Independence Hall, a procession to Washington Square, a wreath laying ceremony, and final words to mark the weekend long celebration. All of these events on Sunday are free and open to the public.
Thomas Long is a retired U.S. Army sergeant and organizer for GoArmy250, the group planning the event. He said the celebration is going to be monumental.
“The birthplace of the Army, the birthplace of the Navy, and the birthplace of the Marines are here, the same birthplace as the nation, but we came first,” he said.
Long, a disabled veteran, noted that Saturday is also Flag Day and Philadelphia will host the Navy and Marines 250th birthday celebrations later this year in the fall.
Earlier in the week, state Sen. Doug Mastriano, chairman of the Senate Veterans and Emergency Preparedness Committee and a retired U.S. Army colonel, held an event in Harrisburg honoring the U.S. Army’s anniversary. The state House also unanimously adopted a resolution sponsored by state Rep. Jim Haddock (D-Luzerne), designating June 14, 2025, as the “250th Birthday of the United States Army” in the state.

Michael Bennet joined a roundtable Thursday with Coloradans who would be hurt by proposed cuts to federal food assistance. They ranged from a grocery store manager in rural Baca County to a farmer from Wellington, north of Fort Collins.
The conversation comes as Congress considers billions of dollars of cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides monthly support for low-income families to buy groceries.
“(Cuts) would have a material effect on communities throughout Colorado, both urban and rural,” Bennet said. “It’s going to affect everybody, no matter where they live, and at a time when they need, desperately, help to just feed their families.”

The House narrowly passed its version of the GOP tax and spending bill last month, which for the first time would require states to shoulder some of the cost of SNAP — up to 25% — starting in 2028. Members of Colorado’s House delegation voted along party lines for the bill, with the GOP in favor and the Democrats opposed. Senate Republicans are pushing for more moderate SNAP cuts compared to their House counterparts.
“These cuts would be devastating,” Bennet said during the remote roundtable. “Now we know what the scope of the Senate cuts are versus the House cuts, and in either case, it’s the largest cuts that have ever been proposed.”
On Wednesday, Senate Agriculture Chairman John Boozman said the Senate GOP plan would result in federal savings of “$52 or $53 billion.”
Both chambers’ plans would tie the percent of the cost burden of SNAP on a state to the rate of that state’s payment errors. Under the Senate plan, states with error rates at 5% or lower would continue to pay nothing for SNAP, while states with error rates at 10% or higher would pay for 15% of benefits, Boozman said. The Senate plan would also create two levels for states with error rates between 5% and 10%. 
Colorado’s SNAP payment error rate is 8.61% as of 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This puts Colorado on a better track than the national average, which is 11.7%. 
Cuts unpopular in Colorado
Laurel Smith, a farmer in Larimer County, said any SNAP cuts would mean a significant loss of revenue and “a reduced quality of life for the community.”
“For my farm stand and my farmers market booth, 65% of my revenue comes from SNAP sales, that’s how much our community members desire SNAP,” said Smith, who herself used SNAP benefits when she was in her 20s to supplement her food budget.
Libby Triebel, a single mother of four who lives in Colorado Springs, said she often “barely scrapes by,” even with SNAP, which gives recipients an average of $6.16 per day for food.
“I do my best, and I make sure (my kids) don’t go a day without having their stomachs full,” Triebel said. “(Cuts) would be harmful, on these families out here that are just making it by to survive, and these kids don’t deserve that.”
About 159,000 Coloradans could lose SNAP benefits under House Republicans’ tax and spending bill, according to an analysis released Thursday by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. 
SNAP cuts are largely unpopular among Colorado voters, though many want to see lower error rates. Just 19% of Colorado voters want to see Congress decrease spending on SNAP, while 46% want to see it increase, 29% want it to stay about the same and 6% are unsure, according to a poll released Tuesday by Healthier Colorado.
‘A fight worth having’
During the roundtable, food bank leaders warned that any cuts to SNAP would add a greater burden on their organizations, which are already stretched thin. For Thai Nguyen, the founder of Kaizen Food Rescue, feeding Coloradans is deeply personal.
Nguyen, who was a refugee and homeless in her youth, knows what it’s like to not have access to healthy, fresh produce. Through her organization, she works to pay forward the help that she received from SNAP. Kaizen Food Rescue has served food to more than 57,000 people in the Denver metro area so far this year.
“We’re trying to just pretty much empower our communities and create a sense of belonging,” Nguyen said. 
Regardless of potential SNAP cuts, Kaizen Food Rescue is already reeling, after a $20 million Environmental Protection Agency grant it had been awarded for an on-site farm was recently revoked, according to Nguyen.
As congressional budget negotiations continue, Bennet urged the roundtable members to continue to push for the nutritious food support they want to see for their communities.
“Please continue to lead this fight, to champion this fight,” Bennet said. “It’s a fight worth having.”

Gov. JB Pritzker spent hours Thursday defending his governing record and Illinois’ immigration policies as he was peppered with questions from members of the U.S. House Oversight Committee.

Pritzker and Democratic governors Kathy Hochul of New York and Tim Walz of Minnesota were summoned to Washington, D.C., by committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., to answer questions about “sanctuary states.” The hearing mostly involved lectures from Republican members arguing immigration policies like Illinois’ diminish public safety while Democratic members blasted the Trump administration’s deportation raids.

“I invited these governors here today because as the chief executives of their states, they willfully ignore federal law, shield illegal aliens and pass the cost of free services onto their hardworking taxpayers,” Comer said. “It’s hard to figure out whose side these governors are on. They shield criminals while their own citizens pay the price.”

Pritzker countered by reiterating a point he has made publicly in Illinois several times since November’s election.

“As I have consistently said, violent criminals have no place on our streets, and if they are undocumented, I want them out of Illinois and out of our country,” Pritzker said. “And as we are reminded in Los Angeles this week, we can all agree that violence of any kind, whomever it is directed at, is unacceptable.”

Pritzker’s appearance before the committee came as nationwide protests grew over the Trump administration’s deportation tactics and increasing arrest numbers by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, especially in Los Angeles.

After protests and violence in that city last weekend prompted President Donald Trump to deploy hundreds of troops, thousands of people marched through the streets of Chicago this week protesting immigration raids. Some protestors briefly clashed with police, and 17 people were arrested, according to Chicago Police.

Dozens more protests are planned in Chicago and around Illinois on Saturday. Dubbed as “No King” protests, the gatherings are designed to contrast with a military parade planned by Trump in Washington on Saturday celebrating the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday. Saturday is also Trump’s 79th birthday.

Pritzker said if the Illinois National Guard ever needs to be activated to quell civil unrest, it’s done in coordination with local law enforcement. He criticized Trump’s deployment of the Guard in Los Angeles.

“It's wrong to deploy the National Guard and active-duty Marines into an American city over the objection of local law enforcement just to inflame a situation and create a crisis,” Pritzker said.

Republicans on the committee alleged “sanctuary state” laws violate federal immigration laws. Illinois’ 2017 TRUST Act, signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, prohibits Illinois law enforcement from detaining people based on their immigration status and assisting in civil immigration enforcement. Law enforcement cannot hold people based on federal immigration warrants in most cases, but they can make arrests for federal criminal warrants.

Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., suggested the three governors be criminally charged with obstruction because of their states’ laws. His comments follow Trump’s suggestion that California Gov. Gavin Newsom should be arrested.

“I have the highest duty to protect the people of my state, and indeed if Tom Homan were to come to my state and try to arrest us, me rather, I can say first of all that he can try,” Pritzker said of Trump’s border czar. “I can also tell you I will stand in the way of Tom Homan going after people who don’t deserve to be frightened in their community.”

Homan told CNN earlier this week Newsom hasn’t done anything to require an arrest.

Controversy over Illinois’ immigration policies

Pritzker blamed decades of federal government inaction on immigration and border security for exacerbating issues in the U.S. He also acknowledged to Comer that President Joe Biden inadequately handled immigration, particularly as 50,000 migrants were sent to Illinois mostly by the governor of Texas.

“We’re not in charge of the border in Illinois, I can tell you that,” Pritzker later told Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas. “We don’t have a border with a foreign country. ... We had 50,000 people who came from Texas because they were shipped to us. And let me tell you, I was in favor of helping them.”

Pritzker occasionally butted heads with Republicans throughout the hearing. Comer questioned the governor about the death of Katie Abraham in an Urbana car crash. She was killed in January by a suspected drunken driver illegally in the United States, according to WCIA. The GOP members mentioned several crime victims by name throughout the hearing.

Rep. Mary Miller, a Republican from Hindsboro, accused Pritzker of “rolling out the red carpet for illegal aliens,” adding “illegal aliens in our state have overwhelmed our communities.”

“I am not going to be lectured to by someone who extolled the virtues of Adolf Hitler,” Pritzker said, alluding to comments Miller made on Jan. 6, 2021.

Given multiple scenarios about what should happen to people who commit crimes while illegally in the country, Pritzker reiterated he supports deporting violent people but emphasized that must happen with due process. Democrats have argued Trump’s administration is deporting people without due process.

Republicans also criticized Illinois’ recent budgets for providing more than $1 billion of state health care benefits to people without documentation along with other programs for noncitizens. However, Pritzker is expected to sign a new state budget this month that eliminates a $330 million health care program for immigrants between ages 42 and 64.

“You do not keep track of any public service dollars in the state of Illinois that goes to illegal immigrants?” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., asked Pritzker after the governor didn't offer specifics about exactly how much Illinois spends on “illegal immigration.”

And while Pritzker cast some blame on Republican-led border states for making Illinois part of recent waves of millions of migrants, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., remarked that while “Illinois didn’t ask for this crisis” as Pritzker said in his opening remarks, “neither did Yuma, Arizona.”

The hearing’s message

The hearing veered off topic several times. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Schaumburg Democrat, praised Pritzker’s work on the economy and spent time discussing Pope Leo XIV’s White Sox loyalty while Texas Republican Rep. Brandon Gill asked Pritzker whether he’s ever used a woman’s restroom.

“You’re admitting that this is just a political circus,” Pritzker responded to Gill.

Aside from Gill’s question about bathrooms, Pritzker largely avoided any immigration-related viral moments. The most intense grilling was reserved for Walz as the Democrat’s 2024 vice presidential nominee and Hochul over high-profile murders in New York.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., remarked the hearing featured a possible preview of the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. Pritzker and Walz are both viewed as possible candidates in the next presidential election.

Pritzker’s appearance at the committee hearing is the latest opportunity to grow his national profile. His schedule throughout 2025 has been dotted with national media interviews and out-of-state speaking engagements where he has often called for more protests of the Trump administration.

He echoed that message again Thursday.

“I encourage people to peacefully protest, and I have said that many times,” he said.

Pritzker said Trump “has created a situation where people are afraid.”

“They're afraid they’re going to get targeted because that is what’s happening under this administration. People are getting individually targeted when they stand up and speak out,” Pritzker said.

(Getty image)UnitedHealthcare paid $1 million and two Rhode Island health insurers paid lesser fines for violating state rules for health coverage of COVID-19 services. 
Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King announced Thursday that his office had finished collecting fines charged to UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island (BCBSRI) and Aetna. The insurers were penalized for charging patients out-of-pocket costs for pandemic-related care, such as emergency room care, doctor visits, and hospital stays — services that should have been fully covered under a 2021 rule promulgated by Patrick Tigue, King’s predecessor in the the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC).
UnitedHealthcare incurred the heaviest fine while Blue Cross and Aetna were fined $20,000 and $10,000, respectively. Consent decrees for the insurance companies stipulated payment was due for UnitedHealthcare and Aetna on June 2, while Blue Cross needed to pay up by June 6. King said Thursday that the final payment was made last week.
“OHIC expects health insurance companies to comply with the law,” King wrote in an email. “When they do not, they must take corrective actions and face consequences.”
The fines accumulated from July 3, 2021, when the rule was formalized into general law, through May 11, 2023, when Rhode Island’s cost waiver rule expired and the COVID-19 public health emergency officially ended.
The cost waiver, however, only applied to fully insured plans, or coverage plans purchased by employers in which the insurer assumes the financial responsibility and risk. The cost mandate did not apply to people receiving services under self-insured plans — the kind of coverage often purchased by larger companies and held by about 60% of covered Rhode Islanders.
The three consent decrees OHIC released Thursday detail the scope of violations and how the insurers fixed their billing problems. UnitedHealthcare’s hefty $1 million fine derived from 1,545 claims in which Rhode Island plan members were wrongly charged for COVID-related care. In 2023, the company reprocessed the claims and refunded roughly $270,000 to affected members.
“We are pleased to have resolved this issue with the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner,” Bradley J. Alexander, a spokesperson for United, said in an email Thursday. “We remain focused on helping individuals access care while supporting our employees, our network of care providers, our clients and the communities we serve.”
The Blue Cross case was less straightforward. The insurer had already waived cost-sharing for COVID treatment in April 2020, according to spokesperson Rich Salit.
“BCBSRI’s cost-share waiver applied to all in-network services and out-of-network services received outside of Rhode Island,” Salit wrote. “For services in Rhode Island, BCBSRI was encouraging members to seek care from our broad network, as members going out-of-network could still be exposed to provider balance billing.”
Balance billing is when out-of-network providers charge patients for what insurance didn’t pay. 
According to the consent decree, Blue Cross believed its policy complied with the OHIC statute, at first indicating “that it was not waiving cost sharing on services related to the treatment of COVID-19 if such services were provided by out-of-network providers within Rhode Island.” 
Nevertheless, OHIC did not agree with that interpretation and penalized the company for not covering the out-of-network care in 19 claims. Blue Cross was required to pay $1,751.60 in refunds, plus the $20,000 fine. Salit said the claims came from eight plan members. 
“BCBSRI agreed to reimburse the cost sharing those members incurred and updated its policy, and the matter was resolved,” Salit wrote.
Aetna, a subsidiary of CVS, only had three claims flagged under the OHIC rule.  
“We are pleased this agreement resolves issues with the OHIC related to three (3) Aetna claims, which we reprocessed in 2022,” Phillip J. Blando, an Aetna spokesperson, wrote via email.
The penalty money goes into the state’s general fund, according to OHIC.

Courtesy of Georgia Building AuthorityThe state government and Atlanta City Council are at odds over a proposed skybridge connecting the state Capitol with a new legislative office building currently under construction across the street.
The Georgia General Assembly last year approved spending $392 million on the new office building to house government offices and committee hearings and for other refurbishments to the Capitol campus.
But the state needs authorization from Atlanta to build the skybridge, which would extend over Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, because part of its footing takes up some of the city’s right of way, and they also need air rights. Members of the city’s transportation committee voted 5-0 to table the project Wednesday.
David Mitchell, executive director of the Atlanta Preservation Center, said the Capitol is one of Atlanta’s most iconic buildings and the state hasn’t done enough to work with the city.
“To do this, to allow them to have this in perpetuity basically diminishes Atlanta’s autonomy, diminishes what Atlanta stands for and it allows the state to come in and basically say they can do whatever they want,” he told committee members. “It is offensive.”
Council members expressed concerns that the skybridge would interfere with efforts to revitalize downtown Atlanta.
“I’m a big believer that these sorts of pedestrian bridges – or as like to call them, hamster tubes – don’t do much or do anything to get people on the street and patronizing businesses because they’re able to go from building to building without really interacting with the street in a way that breaks the vibrancy that we’re looking for,” said Councilman Jason Dozier, whose district includes the Capitol.
Councilman Amir Farokhi agreed.
“Our friends from Dalton and Thomasville and Macon and Swainsboro, et cetera, we welcome them on our streets, and as you spend time during the legislative session at the Capitol and the state buildings complex, downtown Atlanta and the area around the state Capitol will be made better by folks walking around the footprint,” he said.
But Gerald Pilgrim, chief of staff at the Georgia Building Authority, said lawmakers, lobbyists and members of the public attending legislative hearings won’t pass any small businesses between the Capitol and the new legislative building whether they cross Martin Luther King Jr. Drive at the crosswalk or high above traffic.
“The state of Georgia, we own the blocks around this area,” he said. “There are no private businesses within multiple blocks of this location. The closest restaurants to the area are both owned by the Georgia Building Authority, so we really weren’t sure, we didn’t understand those (comments).”
“It’s just to connect the Capitol and the legislative office building,” he added. “You would still have to walk to get to the Capitol from a parking lot or parking deck or MARTA. You would have to walk to get to the legislative office buildings from those things. So it’s still the same.”
Pilgrim said the skybridge will improve accessibility to the Capitol and to committee hearings for young people, seniors and people in wheelchairs. He said his agency is ready to answer any questions the council has and hopes they can come to an agreement.
“Ultimately, the new legislative office is being built. It will be open October 31st, 2026, and hopefully we’ll have a bridge. If not, that’ll be something that somebody can add at a future time,” he said.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Gov. Phil Scott has signed this year’s housing package into law, creating a new financing tool for infrastructure that supports housing construction and enshrining stronger fair housing protections for immigrants.
The marquee policy in the bill, S.127, is the Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, which is intended to help cover costly infrastructure upgrades that are needed to make residential development possible.
Essentially a smaller-scale version of Vermont’s existing tax increment financing program, CHIP will allow municipalities and developers to borrow money for infrastructure like roads, sidewalks and sewers for a housing project – and then use the increased property tax revenue from the homes to help pay back the debt. 
If developers and municipalities take advantage of CHIP to its full extent, the program has the potential to unleash $2 billion in infrastructure spending over the next decade – a level of investment that proponents believe could help move the needle on Vermont’s severe housing shortage. 
The bill’s passage was far from assured. The new infrastructure program was the subject of prolonged -– and at times acrimonious — debate among lawmakers before most went home in late May. House Democrats pushed hard for more guardrails to the new initiative. Their primary concern was that any new development that might have occurred even without help from the tax incentive would result in foregone property tax revenue to the overstretched Education Fund.
The Senate — and the Scott administration — had pushed for fewer rules, arguing that a more flexible version of the initiative would help add more homes to the statewide grand list and spread out the burden of rising education costs. A new coalition of housing advocates, Chamber of Commerce lobbyists and the Vermont League of Cities and Towns also pushed for a less strict version of the initiative.
Lawmakers ultimately landed somewhere in the middle – significantly raising a yearly tax increment cap favored by House Democrats, but retaining a version of a controversial “but for” test to determine whether a project would have happened without the public financing boost.

That proved enough to earn the Republican governor’s signature. But the infrastructure financing program is the only significant piece of Scott’s housing agenda that lawmakers followed through on this year. 
The Scott administration had vied for changes to the municipal appeals process for housing projects. But legislators failed to agree on reforming how and when neighbors can challenge housing developments in court, vowing to return to the issue next year once they’ve received a report back from the board that oversees Act 250. Scott had seen more room to amend the statewide development review law – which lawmakers overhauled last year – but legislators showed little interest in revisiting the subject this session.
S.127 also contains new housing protections for immigrants living in Vermont who lack legal status.
It adds citizenship and immigration status to the list of protected classes in Vermont’s fair housing laws, prohibiting discrimination on those grounds when someone is seeking to rent or buy a home. 
The legislation also mandates that a landlord needs to accept a range of forms of identification on a rental application in order to conduct credit and background checks – not only a Social Security number. Several immigrants testified at the Statehouse this session that landlords have frequently passed them over when they couldn’t provide the identifier. The advocacy group Migrant Justice pushed for the new protections.
The eclectic legislation also includes measures aimed at streamlining development on contaminated brownfield sites, a future study that would look at creating a statewide land bank for buildings that have fallen into disrepair, and a report on housing needs for people with developmental disabilities.

CHICAGO — The state of Illinois is investigating an automatic license plate reader system used in a northwest suburb after a Texas sheriff accessed the system to look for a woman who recently had an abortion.

This and hundreds of other searches, according to Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, violated Illinois law.

Law enforcement agencies seeking to access license plate reader data collected in Illinois would first have to attest in writing that they wouldn’t use it to enforce other state’s laws relating to abortion or immigration.

“There is concern that other law enforcement agencies are breaking the law, whether they're doing it maliciously or unintentionally — that’s almost irrelevant,” Giannoulias said at a Thursday news conference.

Police in Mount Prospect, a village in suburban Cook County, set up a license plate reader system in such a way that allowed other law enforcement agencies to access data without providing written attestations. In addition to the Texas case, Giannoulias’ office said Mount Prospect’s system had been searched 262 times for immigration-related reasons between mid-January and the end of April.

The Texas case came to light after a report from the tech outlet 404 Media found the search impacted more than 83,000 license plate reader cameras in multiple states.

Giannoulias also noted that 46 out-of-state law enforcement agencies conducted searches of Illinois records that violated state law.

In response, Giannoulias’ office — which generally handles policy surrounding license plate readers and data sharing — announced it had instructed Flock Safety, a company that operates license plate readers in Mount Prospect, to shut off access to the system to out-of-state agencies. Giannoulias said he is also working with the Illinois attorney general to investigate further.

The secretary of state’s office said it will also establish an auditing system and additional safeguards.

“Automatic license plate readers are there to prevent violent crime, to prevent carjacking, to find stolen vehicles and to help when there’s a kidnapping, right?” Giannoulias said. “That’s what they are used for. When this data is being used to track people getting abortions or for ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to use to track down individuals based on immigration policy. That is a very slippery slope.”

Advocates for immigration rights and reproductive rights applauded the state’s move.

“Our statewide policies are only as strong as the counties, cities and municipalities that implement these policies across Illinois,” Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights Executive Director Lawrence Benito said Thursday. “When we are not on the same page, the misalignment can harm those in Illinois who are merely seeking the dignity and respect not afforded to them elsewhere.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota could lose up the half a billion dollars annually if a GOP-backed tax bill becomes federal law, Minnesota’s Medicaid director warned Thursday.
That could mean fewer services or tighter restrictions on eligibility, affecting health care for hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans and the hospitals and other providers that treat them. 
The bill, which has already passed the U.S. House on a 215-214 vote, is still far off from becoming law; Senate Republicans are drafting their own version, and the GOP remains deeply split over how to pay for tax cuts, which is their ultimate goal. For now, the House legislation is the most detailed public plan for how Republicans will fund an extension of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, plus a bunch more. 
The tax cuts passed by the House would decrease federal revenue by about $3.7 trillion over the next ten years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. To offset the loss of income, Republicans want to cut spending by $1.3 trillion, mostly by targeting Medicaid and SNAP, which helps low-income people buy food. (The $2.4 trillion gap between the revenue and spending cuts would be added to the federal debt, which will in turn increase what taxpayers must shell out in interest payments, which have surpassed $1 trillion annually.)
Medicaid pays for health care for the elderly, low-income and disabled. The cost is shared between states and the federal government; last year, Minnesota spent $18 billion on Medical Assistance, which is Minnesota’s version of Medicaid. The federal government covered $11 billion of that. 
More than 1.2 million Minnesotans rely on Medical Assistance, and deep cuts would cause “serious harm” to Minnesotans, said John Connolly, Minnesota’s Medicaid director.
“Our position at the Minnesota Department of Human Services is that the bill currently on the table is inefficient, ineffective and fundamentally unfair,” Connolly said during a press briefing. 
Minnesota is already grappling with how to pay for care for an aging population as health care costs continue to rise. 
The state Legislature made $270 million in cuts to Medical Assistance this year, as spending on the program has risen faster than tax revenues. 
DHS estimates that if the U.S. House tax bill were to become law, the state would lose out on $500 million per year. The bill would cause between 152,000 and 253,000 Minnesotans to lose health insurance, according to Kaiser Family Foundation.
It would also push costs onto state and local governments, Connolly said, by requiring county and tribal governments to verify participants’ eligibility twice as often as they do now, and increasing the administrative burden for the state.
The largest chunk of the possible cuts to Minnesota comes from a provision that would reduce Medicaid reimbursements for states that subsidize health insurance for undocumented people. The Legislature voted this week to remove eligibility of undocumented adults for MinnesotaCare, a state- and federally-funded health insurance program for the working poor that is separate from Medical Assistance. 
As long as undocumented children remain eligible for MinnesotaCare — and if the House language becomes law — Minnesota would still have its federal funding cut by about $330 million, according to DHS.
Senate Republicans are wary of deep Medicaid cuts, and are instead expected to target SNAP, the New York Times reported Thursday. The Senate has not yet introduced its version of the tax bill. 
A proposal to shift 25% of federal SNAP benefit costs onto states would shift up to $220 million annual cost to Minnesota, according to the state Department of Youth and Family Services. 
More than 440,000 Minnesotans rely on SNAP benefits, according to DCYF. More than one-third are children, 18% are seniors and 14% are adults with a disability. 
If these federal cost shifts and cuts become law, the Minnesota Legislature would likely be forced to return to St. Paul for a special session to either raise taxes, cut services or move money around to fulfill lawmakers’ constitutional obligation to balance the budget.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250405_1017-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Credit: Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier on Thursday blamed the Biden administration for a scheme where tax collector employees sold driver’s licenses to immigrants who didn’t take the required test.
Uthemeier linked the fraud in Panama City to former President Joe Biden’s immigration policies during a press conference announcing the arrests of the two public employees, five people who helped the employees commit the fraud, and one woman who had paid to receive a passing grade on her driving skills test.
“I think today is yet another example of how the Biden border policy puts American families at risk. Here you’ve got hundreds of aliens that are cheating, that are breaking the law, that are buying driver’s licenses without taking the test, getting on the roads, putting everybody in danger,” Uthmeier said.
Immigration officials also appeared at the press conference with Uthmeier to further the message of cracking down on illegal immigration.

Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said most of the people who got fraudulent licenses had an immigration status authorizing them to drive illegally, based on the information gathered during the month-long investigation.
Police seized on Wednesday $120,000 that the employees appeared to have made from the scheme that has been going on for three years, Ford said.
“What we have found so far in this case is that most of the aliens that were getting driver’s licenses have some type of status. Some of that is the asylum status, which we know is a very controversial process, and doesn’t take a lot to get that status,” Ford said without presenting evidence that that was the case for the asylum seekers who bought the licenses.
At this time, Ford said officials didn’t know when the immigrants buying licenses had entered the country.
Ford didn’t have a narrow estimate of how many licenses the employees had sold, saying that hundreds or thousands of people living across the state could have bought a license from the Panama City tax collector’s office.
Asylum seekers with valid work permits can get driver’s licenses in Florida.
Chuck Purdue, Bay County’s tax collector, said his office first noticed indications of the fraud in April, when he saw one of the employees had conducted 295 road exams in one month — the average is 20 to 25. But he sidestepped a question about whether the supervisors of the arrested employees would face consequences, and said that the two employees were the only ones known to have sold the licenses.
“The sheriff and I’ll have to talk about that. We have not talked about it that far yet,” Purdue said.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch)It’s been one year since Congress allowed the program offering payments to downwinders to expire. Now, advocates are hoping the U.S. Senate will revive the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, as part of the “big, beautiful” bill.
One year without RECA: Justice delayed for radiation victims in Idaho and beyond

That includes Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who told reporters on Tuesday he’s “hoping something can get done.”
RECA had been in place since 1990, offering payments to uranium workers and downwinders, people who contracted cancer from above-ground nuclear tests. For years it was criticized for being too narrow — despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.
And since the program expired last June, Congress has been unable to bring RECA back, stymied by spending concerns. Although the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley that would greatly expand the program, including to cover downwinders in Idaho, it hasn’t been considered in the House.
 Could RECA protections be included in federal budget bill? Maybe.

During a press conference in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, advocates called on U.S. Sens. John Curtis and Mike Lee, both R-Utah, to get behind an amendment to Congress’ budget bill similar to what Hawley has proposed.
“There’s a real possibility that a RECA reauthorization and expansion could be included in H.R.1,” said Steve Erickson, a longtime advocate for downwinders. “But this will need the support of Utah’s congressional delegation, especially the full-throated support from Senator Lee and Senator Curtis. Without their support, the prospects for RECA are much diminished.”
Neither Curtis or Lee’s offices responded to a request for comment.
When asked about RECA during his monthly PBS news conference on Tuesday, Cox said he’s hopeful Congress will find a way to bring the program back during budget reconciliation. Cox, along with a coalition of 41 Utah lawmakers, have previously supported efforts to expand the program, specifically Hawley’s bill.
Hawley’s bill would expand the program to cover all of Utah and a handful of other Western states that weren’t previously included in RECA, while extending coverage to communities around St. Louis and territories in the Pacific that were impacted by nuclear weapons testing development.
“We’ll continue to express support for that,” Cox said on Tuesday. “The repercussions of that above-ground nuclear testing in Utah are very long lasting and many of us had family members that have been impacted. So I think it’s still important. Utah is not alone but Utah was significantly impacted.”
However, the governor noted there haven’t been any new developments in his talks with the congressional delegation.
 RECA has historically had bipartisan support in U.S. Congress

People who submitted their claims before the deadline last summer can still receive payments — but there’s no option for downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer, or didn’t know about the program.
“(We) continue to receive emails and phone calls from affected community members here in Utah who have received cancer diagnosis, asking where to apply and what to do,” said Carmen Valdez, a senior policy associate for the Health Environment Alliance of Utah. “It’s really discouraging to say that the program is expired and they can no longer apply, but they can contact their delegation about it.”
RECA has always had bipartisan support. Originally sponsored by late Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, both Democrats and Republicans have since advocated for its expansion. That includes U.S. Sens. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M. and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, who have lobbied with Hawley to expand the program.
“This is not a partisan play by any means,” said Erickson.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)From Ironwood in the western Upper Peninsula to Adrian, near the Ohio border, more than 70 “No Kings Day” protests against President Donald Trump are planned in Michigan this Saturday.
Included in that list are larger demonstrations set for Detroit, Flint, Grand Rapids, Lansing, and Kalamazoo, among more than 1,500 planned in cities across the nation to protest against “authoritarian overreach and the gross abuse of power” which No Kings protest organizers say has been demonstrated by the Trump Administration.
The protests are timed to coincide with festivities scheduled in Washington D.C. to ostensibly celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday, but also Trump’s 79th birthday, with a military parade featuring nearly 7,000 soldiers, and 150 vehicles, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, as well as military flyovers from 50 aircraft. 
Estimated to cost $45 million, the planned exhibition has drawn criticism as an ostentatious display at a time congressional Republicans have pushed through a budget plan that would gut federal safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance, simultaneous to Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles over immigration protests.
“Rapid and widespread attacks against vulnerable members of our communities and those who voice political dissent, illegal and arbitrary arrests and deportations, antidemocratic acts of repression of free speech, and flagrant defiance of the courts demonstrate that the current administration stands in opposition to the founding principles of our nation,” organizers of Detroit’s protest said in a statement. 
Set to begin Saturday at 1 p.m. in Clark Park, Detroit’s No Kings protest will feature U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), an outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts and use of the military against civilian protestors in LA.

The Grand Rapids protest will start at 10 a.m in Ah-Nab-Awen Park, with speakers including City Commissioner Marshall Kilgore and Rev. Nathan Dannison of the Fountain Street Church.
“Local community organizations will have ‘Take Action’ stations providing attendees with specific actions to take,” organizers said in a release. “This rally will also include family-friendly activities. We follow the principles of non-violence protests. Harassment and hate speech will not be tolerated.”
That same message was echoed earlier this week by state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia), who along with state Rep. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor), urged Michiganders to take part in the protests, but do so peacefully.
“Let me be crystal clear: We unequivocally condemn any violence. That has no place in our movement for peace and justice. Everyone should use their voice peacefully, but the Trump administration intentionally provoked the situation by sending a force of armed and armored agents to round up immigrant workers,” Pohutsky said.
Smaller municipalities are also holding protests, including in Republican-heavy areas like Livingston County, which has “No Kings” protests planned at the Historic Courthouse in Downtown Howell and at the public amphitheatre adjacent to Brighton’s Millpond.
The Brighton gathering will feature Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel and Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Secretary of State.
Another of the larger No Kings protests is planned at the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing, which starts with a “Kick Out the Clowns” rally at noon, followed by a sidewalk march around the Capitol and then a “No Kings” carnival from 3-6 p.m. 
“Participants are encouraged to bring signs and flags while they stand in solidarity against this abuse of taxpayer funds. Planned circus-themed activities will highlight the absurdity of the administration’s self-aggrandizement and flagrant disregard for American laws and norms,” stated a release.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AMR_0021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Free.,"Teachers, parents, Arizona senator rally against GOP plans to reduce education spending",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/teachers-parents-arizona-senator-rally-against-gop-plans-reduce-education-spending,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly joined education advocates, parents, teachers and students Thursday to blast congressional Republicans’ proposed cuts to education.The Arizona Democrat and demonstrators spoke out against GOP lawmakers’ “big, beautiful bill,” an attempt to slash billions of dollars in federal spending to offset the cost of President Donald Trump’s sweeping agenda and tax cuts.Kelly lambasted the private school voucher program tucked into the House’s version of the reconciliation package. The proposal would allocate $5 billion a year in tax credits for people donating to organizations that provide private and religious school scholarships.“They want to play by different rules — a backhanded way to take your tax dollars and stick it into private schools,” he said. “Let me tell you, Arizona has been fighting this fight for years now, and it is not going well, and the public education that kids can get in the state of Arizona is not the same as it was 10 years ago, so this is not a good idea — it’s a horrible idea.”Congressional Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to allow the package to move through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote threshold that generally requires bipartisanship.The House narrowly passed its version of the legislation in May, and it is starting to see proposed changes in the Senate, including on the higher education system.Advocates also blasted the House reconciliation bill’s cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as the private school voucher program.‘A direct threat to our children’s future’“We’ve got to make it easier for kids to get an education,” Kelly said. “We’ve got to make it easier for kids to get the support they need — to get a good start, a good start in life and get a good career that you can actually raise a family on, and that starts right here, right now, with not allowing this Congress and this White House to take us backward.” The National Parents Union hosted the rally alongside Educators for Excellence, Education Leaders of Color and EdTrust.“All week long, parents, students and educators — the real people on the front lines of America’s public schools — have been walking these halls of Congress, meeting with members of the House, members of the Senate, and making one thing crystal clear: this so-called ‘big, beautiful bill’ is a direct threat to our children’s future, and we will not stand for it,” said Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, which includes more than 1,800 affiliated parent organizations across the United States.“There is nothing big or beautiful about slashing billions from public education,” she said.Meanwhile, Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request calls for $12 billion in spending cuts at the Education Department, as he and his administration have sought to dramatically redefine the federal role in education and dismantle the agency.GOP senators’ take on higher ed overhaulEarlier this week, Republicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions released their draft proposal for the reconciliation package, which offers some similarities to the higher education system provisions in the House version of the bill.Some similarities between the House and Senate versions include: massive changes to student loan repayment options, the creation of a Workforce Pell Grant program and the elimination of both the Grad PLUS program and the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan.But the Senate’s portion leaves out some of the House’s most sweeping provisions affecting higher education affordability and access.Unlike in the House, the Senate’s version does not raise the minimum number of credit hours to qualify for the maximum Pell Grant award from 12 credit hours per semester to 15 credit hours, nor does it repeal subsidized loans or eliminate the “90/10 rule,” which requires that at least 10% of the money for-profit institutions receive derives from non-federal sources.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Esperanza Moran, who openly rallied for the dismissal of former LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick, is the subject of an anonymous whistleblower complaint, at least one Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint and a separate complaint filed with the governor. 
Moran is accused of trying to have multiple LSU Health Shreveport administrators fired. 
Esperanza Moran lives in Shreveport and is married to wealthy businessman Scott Moran. The couple own several businesses, including Moran Oil Co., and give generously to Republican political campaigns, including Landry’s. 
Sen. Sam Jenkins, D-Shreveport, who represents the district where LSU Health Shreveport is, said that while questions were raised about Esperanza Moran, Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, who represents her district, was steadfast in his support of her. 
Senators rarely reject gubernatorial appointments. Appointees typically must only secure the support of their own senator to receive confirmation. 
Senate confirmation allows Moran to serve on the LSU board until June 1, 2030, when she would be eligible to be appointed to another term.

(Courtesy of U.S. Forest Service/Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1)As hot, dry weather settles in, officials are predicting a greater than usual likelihood that Idaho will experience significant wildfires this summer.
The Predictive Services Office at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise’s new forecast for June through September shows an above normal potential for significant wildfire developing in northern Idaho this month. The above normal potential for significant wildfire then expands into southern Idaho and central Idaho from July into September.
“What that means is if an accidental ignition occurs or a lighting ignition occurs, there is going to be a greater potential for those ignitions to develop into serious incidents that get large enough to affect people or pose a risk to life or property,” said Rebecca Paterson, a public affairs specialist for the the Bureau of Land Management who is based at the National Interagency Fire Center, or NIFC, in Boise.

Even though there was a healthy snowpack in many parts of Idaho this winter, warm, dry weather has rapidly melted the snowpack, which contributes to the risk of wildfire, Paterson said.
Abundant drying grass crops throughout southern Idaho, mixed with forecasts for low levels of precipitation and high temperature also contribute to the risk, she said.
Located next to the Boise Airport, NIFC is the country’s headquarters for wildland fire operations. Several different agencies are represented at NIFC, including the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service and more.
State of Idaho, federal government set aside money to boost firefighter pay following concerns
Both the state and federal government have taken steps to address widespread concern over pay for wildland firefighters.
In March, the Idaho Legislature’s budget committee approved $1 million in pay bonuses for state firefighters working for the Idaho Department of Lands.
That same month, the U.S. Department of Interior announced permanent pay increases for federal and tribal wildland firefighters.
Paterson said the federal pay increases are a result of years worth of efforts to help recruit and retrain firefighters. She said the firefighters who stand to benefit most from the pay increases are firefighters in the beginning stages of their career at the lower end of the pay scale.
It’s too early to tell how the raises are affecting retention, but on Monday afternoon a Department of Interior spokeswoman said hiring is up slightly compared to a year ago. As of June 2, the U.S. Department of Interior had hired 4,830 wildland fire personnel across the country, which is up slightly from a year ago, the spokeswoman said.
But even with steps taken to address pay and turnover, Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller still expressed concern with the levels of federal nonfirefighting staff and the ability to hire and retain mid- to upper-management level engine captains in Idaho.
“I am confident in the amount of resources we are going to have this year (at the state level, but) what is concerning is the support positions at the federal level,” Miller said in a phone interview Monday. “We have been told to expect the same level of initial attack resources from the U.S. Forest Service, but what is concerning is that many nonfire staff who pay critical roles in incident management teams have taken various voluntary departure options offered by the federal government.”
At the state level, Miller said Idaho will also have slightly more firefighters than last year. But Miller said Idaho still struggles to fill permanent engine captain positions. As a result, Miller said the Idaho Department of Lands will only be able to staff 50% of the engines with seven-days-per-week coverage.
Miller said the Idaho Department of Lands is looking to other permanent staff members who have retained their fire qualifications to help boost staffing and coverage.
“We are ready to go this fire season,” Miller said. “We have most of the resources we need and, again, we will be relying heavily on others within the Department of Lands to participate at some level during fire season.”
Support for Idaho’s state wildfire suppression fund
Another potential concern is funding in Idaho’s state wildfire suppression fund. This year, the Idaho Legislature approved transferring $40 million to the state’s Fire Suppression Deficiency Fund, the Sun previously reported. However the $40 million is less than the $58 million the state spent fighting wildfires in 2024 alone.
If the state spends more money than it has available to fight wildfires, it can still pay its bills through a process called deficiency warrants. But then the state would need to go back to the Idaho Legislature next year with bills for the deficiency warrants, which would be a little bit like using a credit card to pay wildfire bills.
At any rate, Gov. Brad Little had requested $60 million in new funding (not just the $40 million) for the wildfire account and urged legislators to give the state the tools it needs to aggressively fight wildfires from the beginning.
Partnerships and relationships between different state and federal agencies are key factors in fighting wildfires.
In Idaho, the location of where a fire starts plays a role in determining which agency responds. Depending on jurisdiction, what type of land the fire is located on and how big the fire is, federal wildland firefighters, state firefighters, the local community fire department or a volunteer fire protection service may show up to fight the fire.
Fire officials call on the public to help reduce risk of wildfire
While firefighters cannot prevent lightning strikes from starting wildfires, Paterson did say Idahoans can help reduce the risk of wildfire this summer. Most of the wildfires in Idaho in recent years have been caused by people.
Dousing all campfires and extinguishing them dead out, avoiding parking vehicles on grass and preventing chains from dragging behind vehicles and throwing off sparks can all help prevent wildfires.
“Weather, climate and fuel conditions cause those ignitions to become serious incidents, perhaps a lot faster than you expect, and tax responders’ ability to respond,” Paterson said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-12 21:43:07+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘It has been 60 days’: Letter demands release of federal  family planning funds,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/12/groups-demand-release-of-federal-family-planning-funds/,Groups in Mississippi and other states are demanding answers about why a federal agency continues to withhold money for family planning health services.,"Two weeks after it was forced to lay off half its staff, the nonprofit group that administers federal family planning money in Mississippi has yet to hear back about an obscure investigation that paused its funding. 
Title X, a federal program that has been providing money for family planning services to states for over 50 years, flows through Converge to 91 clinics around the state. On March 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told Converge it was withholding $4.5 million intended for Mississippi’s Title X program indefinitely during an investigation into the organization’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices. 
On Monday, nonprofit Converge signed a joint letter with the six other states whose Title X funds had been withheld requesting that HHS update grantees on the status of their funding. 
“Three months into HHS’ withholding, we remain frustratingly in the dark about the agency’s plan,” Audrey Sandusky, vice president of communications and marketing at Converge, told Mississippi Today. “The consequences of inaction are real and dangerous, from rising rates of cervical cancer and unplanned pregnancy to a surge in congenital syphilis.”
The grantees’ letter, addressed to HHS Deputy Director Amy Margolis, said all the recipients had met the 10-day deadline imposed on them by the federal agency to submit information, but had not heard so much as a confirmation in the 60 days since then. 
“In light of the harmful impacts of our Title X funding being withheld, we request that you share information about your process and timeline for releasing the funding by June 20th and releasing the funds as soon as possible,” the letter read. 
HHS has not responded to Mississippi Today’s request for comment about why it withheld Converge’s funding. 
In its original letter to Converge, HHS alleged the nonprofit “could be in violation” of the terms of the award and parts of the federal civil rights law. The allegation referenced a 2020 statement the nonprofit made committing to diversity in health care amid the George Floyd protests. 
In the two months since their federal funding stopped flowing, Converge leaders have focused all efforts on fundraising and expanding access to low-cost care through telehealth and pop-up clinics. 
The next pop-up clinic will take place July 26 at the Jackson Medical Mall and will include physical exams, testing for sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy tests and preconception counseling, and prescriptions for birth control. All services will be available on a sliding scale. 
“A month delay may not sound like a huge deal to some people, but when you’re talking about women’s health care, one month could be a huge deal,” said Converge co-executive director Jamie Bardwell. “You could be missing your prescription for birth control, (and) perhaps it results in an unplanned pregnancy. Perhaps you don’t get screened for an STD, STI. Congenital syphilis is very high in Mississippi. These are things that just have a very negative effect for women and their children.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/06163254/3X0A6460-scaled.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Campuses across the University System of Maryland were told Thursday to plan for 7% budget cuts in the coming year. (Screengrab courtesy University of Maryland video)Campuses in the University System of Maryland were warned Thursday afternoon to brace for another 7% cut to their budgets in the coming year, on top of the 4% the system was forced to absorb as part of a statewide budget challenge earlier this year.
University System Chancellor Jay Perman, in a video message to more than 40,000 faculty and staff at campuses across the state, said individual campus presidents all agree that personnel cuts should be a last resort. But he noted that, given the size of the reduction and the different situations on different campuses, “for some universities, personnel actions cannot be taken off the table.”
And he warned that the fiscal situation would likely get worse, as federal budget reductions and job cuts continue this year.
“To those affected by these cuts, there’s little I can say that makes it any better,” Perman said, looking into the camera. “I’m sorry that this is happening. It’s not a reflection of your value to the system, to your university, to the students we serve.”
The cuts do not come as a surprise: In May, the Board of Regents unanimously approved a resolution to let campus presidents assess savings such as furloughs, reductions in salaries and the closing of schools for a certain number of days. That resolution was approved as the university system’s 12 institutions and three regional centers stared down a reduction of $155 million, or 7% of their fiscal 2026 budgets.

	While the message may not have been surprise, its delivery — broadcast to every worker in the system — was unusual.
“I don’t usually send out a budget message, like this one” to all employees of the statewide system, Perman said in the video. “I’m doing it now because these aren’t typical times.”
Perman said the cuts would be managed campus-by-campus, “because there’s no one solution for the taking.”
“I know your campus leaders are sharing with you what these cuts will mean, not only for university programs and departments, but for you and your colleagues,” Perman said.
Perman said he and campus leaders agreed to try and “protect our people as much as possible,” look for other cost savings or ways to generate revenue before cutting in to payrolls.
While the next round of cuts will be challenge, Perman also warned of future budget cuts as Maryland awaits federal budget decisions that could result in federal employee layoffs or loss of aid.
“We know it could get worse,” said Perman, adding that the possibility of further cuts was being incorporated in the latest cuts.
Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) acknowledged the federal cuts to higher education programs by the Trump administration could mean more pain for universities.
“They’ve been expecting it and planning for it,” King said about school leaders preparing for budget cuts. “There are probably more to come.”

It hosted a hearing for proposed Medicaid expansion work requirements on June 12, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)More than a dozen people raised concerns and questions about unintentionally separating patients from their health care and other aspects of South Dakota’s proposed Medicaid expansion work requirements during the plan’s final public hearing Thursday in Sioux Falls.
Dana Bacon, state government affairs director at The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, told the state Department of Social Services his organization has “pretty big concerns” due to the technical problems, costs and unintended loss of coverage that people encountered during attempted work requirements in other states.
“That’s going to make individuals, families, systems and communities pay a price for the outcomes,” Bacon said. “We have a good sense of where this waiver is going, but we still see these problems getting in the way of the stated goal of making sure people get the health care they need.”
 

How to submit written comments
Written comments about South Dakota’s Medicaid expansion work requirements proposal may be submitted by June 18 via email to MedicaidSPA@state.sd.us with the subject line “SDCareerLink Public Comment,” or mailed to the Division of Medical Services, Department of Social Services, 700 Governors Drive, Pierre, SD 57501-2291.



Other people questioned the need to implement work requirements and expressed concern about a potentially disproportionate impact on tribal members, as well as the potential barrier the plan could create to health care for sick, homeless and older people.
Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for people with low incomes. South Dakotans voted in 2022 to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level, a decision that allowed the state to capitalize on a 90% federal funding match — funding that could be in jeopardy, pending the outcome of congressional action. Last year, voters passed another constitutional amendment to let the state seek approval from the federal government to impose work requirements on expansion enrollees.
The state began drafting its proposal immediately following the end of the state legislative session in March, before debates about potential federally imposed work requirements heated up at the congressional level. Those debates are ongoing.
The department only heard from one person at its first hearing in May. The state is also accepting written comments through Wednesday, which will be included in the state’s application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services later this summer.
South Dakota’s plan would require adult Medicaid recipients to work, train, attend school or serve as a caretaker for a child or elderly or disabled person in their home unless they qualify for an exception. Compliance with the state-level work rules would be reviewed on an annual basis, at the time of Medicaid renewal, rather than at the time of application. The state would not require a set number of hours of work or education time.
South Dakota would allow exceptions for people who are:

Pregnant or up to 12 months postpartum.
Disabled, as determined by the Social Security Administration.
Diagnosed with cancer or another serious or terminal medical condition by a physician.
In an intensive behavioral health treatment program, hospitalized or living in a nursing home.
In an area with unemployment 20% or more above the national average and are exempt from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents.

As of last month, 30,542 South Dakotans were covered by the Medicaid expansion. The state estimates 80% of them already work or qualify for an exception. The proposed state-level work requirement would reduce enrollment by an estimated 5-10% in the first year. That would save the Medicaid program between $48.9 million and $71 million in the first year, the department says.
Federal action could make SD’s Medicaid work requirements ‘an exercise in futility,’ official says

Department officials explained that expansion enrollees would be sent three notices before being removed from Medicaid rolls. People could reapply later if they don’t meet work requirements at their renewal time.
Heather Petermann, Medicaid director at the department, said people who are seeking treatment for substance use disorder or other mental health disorders outside of intensive treatment programs could obtain an exemption if their physician or health care provider provided documentation that they can’t work because of their condition.
Department Secretary Matt Althoff said the state’s proposal is meant to be administratively simple and to encourage work among Medicaid recipients rather than track hours. 
“We are helping them, we believe, not only by providing a safety net, but a lift up. Isn’t it true that personal industry is the antidote to poverty?” Althoff said. “The more that we can do to discover fulfillment through serving others, the more that we can do to garner an income that we earn, the higher likelihood we will be able to escape the clutches of poverty.”
Other suggestions made during public comment during the hearing included:

Adding volunteer or community service time as an exemption, to benefit older adults who can’t find employment because of their age.
Exempting Indian Health Service beneficiaries, since they are eligible for Medicaid coverage at the federal level even if they do not meet other Medicaid requirements, such as income limits.
Allowing more flexibility to exempt caregivers of older adults who don’t share the same residence.

Trustees at the Pensacola university agreed to pay Diaz an annual base salary of $643,000 with no performance incentive. Other benefits for the one year contract total about $100,000 to pay for his car, housing, and moving expenses.
As commissioner, Diaz makes nearly $324,000 per year.

During the meeting, trustees said long goodbyes to outgoing President Martha Saunders, who resigned before her contract was set to expire. She has been president since 2017.
Saunders’ contract pays her a $536,271 base annual salary and up to 20% performance bonus.
“We will be going into a presidential search and we will be having a firm conduct a compensation analysis and what we’re seeing historically here through all the universities that have gone through presidential searches is that salaries for these university presidents are increasing. Period. So everyone needs to get ready to see that when the compensation analysis comes out,” Chair Rebecca Matthews said. 
“I don’t particularly care” for the salary,  said Alonzie Scott, who also had issues with other provisions in the contract.
Scott, who has been on the board since 2018, noted the contract requires a two-thirds vote of trustees to remove the president. Saunders’ contract and trustee bylaws call for a simple majority vote.
According to Matthews, Diaz requested the supermajority vote for removal.  
“I hope he can do things even comparable to” Martha Saunders, Scott said.
Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Board of Governors, a board majority-appointed by the governor, appointed a slate of eight UWF trustees last winter. At the time DeSantis said the UWF community needed to “buckle up” and prepare for a conservative makeover.  The new UWF board of trustees has caused widespread backlash among the university community and in the Florida Senate. 
The university community has shunned the overhaul of the college. It has launched  Save UWF, and sent people to Tallahassee to oppose the trustees’ during the Senate confirmation hearings.
After trustees were confirmed Saunders resigned.
The trustees with tenure longer than six months have largely opposed the new direction.

Sentiment
Matthews called the contract “conservative” and said she is “Happy and feel extremely comfortable” with it. 
Matthews is the chair a direct support organization to the Department of Education, a position that Diaz appointed her to. DeSantis appointed her to one of his transition committees.
Diaz called his contract “Proper and conservative.”
No votes in opposition to the contract could be heard through the livestream of the meeting.
Trustee Dick Baker, who has been on the board since 2016, said he hopes “we can go forward and not keep looking back or start trying to find things from the past to dig into.”
“I want to be 100% behind President Diaz as we go forward and get the community back working with us to make this the best university,” Baker said, saying he thinks Diaz “desires of doing the very best that he can.”
Diaz will vacate his job in the DeSantis administration to take on the roll of interim president.
His path to interim-presidency mirrors Florida International University President Jeanette Nunez, who was the sole finalist for her job after resigning as lieutenant governor to become interim president. Simultaneously, former President Kenneth Jessell resigned before the end of his contracted term. 
While he didn’t vote against Diaz, Scott had reservations.
“My instincts tell me not to vote for this, but Mr. Baker is convincing me to go the other way somewhat to say that we’re going to try to figure out how to make this work. I do believe we have overcompensated Mr. Diaz for work that he hasn’t performed yet,” Scott said.

Bills to outlaw those materials were back again before the Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety Committee on Thursday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXTestifying before the committee was bill sponsor and state Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing). Tsernoglou said that each time she gets the opportunity to tell her fellow lawmakers there’s a need for more regulation in artificial intelligence, the issue becomes worse because In Michigan, and across other states, there are bad actors who use artificial intelligence to create non-consensual fake pornographic media.
“As the percentage of the population that uses artificial intelligence technology, either knowingly or unknowingly, continues to grow exponentially, we must stay hyper-vigilant in our efforts to regulate the technology and to ensure that our most vulnerable community members are not exploited or harmed,” Tsernoglou told the committee on Thursday.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Department of Homeland Security both are reaching out to the American public about the rising issue of sexual exploitation taking place online, cautioning that children particularly are often being targeted.
Both agencies cited a study from Sensity AI, a research company tracking deepfake media, which found that between 90% and 95% of deepfake videos online since 2018 are nonconsensual pornography and about 90% of those nonconsensual videos are of nonconsensual porn are of women.
As the Michigan Senate considers House Bills 4047 and 4048, introduced by Tsernoglou and Rep. Matt Bierlein (R-Vassar) to ban nonconsensual deepfake pornography and place criminal penalties on their production, lawmakers in the committee meeting Thursday shared how the issue has impacted people they know.
State Sen. Paul Wojno (D-Warren) said he appreciates that the bills address the nefarious nature of the materials, especially when it comes to extortion. He shared that a friend of his daughter had been extorted by someone using a fake image.
“[A] deep fake was created and they sent it to her and threatened that if she didn’t pay a certain amount of money, it would be posted on social media,” Wojno said.
These extortionists don’t even necessarily know their victims, said Zoey Brewer, policy and grassroots coordinator with the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. But by using technology that is becoming more realistic and more accessible to the public, Brewer said criminals are extorting money from victims or creating such intense anxiety in their victims that they can’t attend school or work and, in some cases, they resort to suicide.

The bills have bipartisan support, and cleared the state House with a nearly unanimous vote in April, just as they did last session. But the bills failed to clear the state Senate last year during a turbulent lame duck session.
State Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), the committee’s chair, said the Senate had “every intention” of taking up the bills, but she’s glad lawmakers are pressing the issue again this session.
 
Deepfakes don’t just impact celebrities and they aren’t harmless jokes, Bierlein said. Michigan’s laws have left families and law enforcement without proper recourse to go after extortionists making fake sexual materials, he added.
Among the groups who submitted support for the bills was the Michigan Sheriff’s Association.
The legislation being considered by the committee would send a strong message that Michigan will not tolerate digital abuse and would not only criminalize nonconsensual deepfake pornography, but also allow victims to sue the individuals who create it, Bierlein said.
“They’re deeply invasive, traumatic violations that can ruin lives,” Bierlein said of deepfake pornographic media. “Reputations, careers and mental health have all been damaged or destroyed by the weaponization of someone’s likeness, often targeting women, minors and vulnerable individuals. This is not a hypothetical issue, in my own district I have heard from families and young people who have been directly affected by these people.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Facetune_24-04-2025-17-00-33-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Free.,Trump signs law repealing tailpipe emission standards affecting 18 states,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-law-repealing-tailpipe-emission-standards-affecting-18-states,,"President Donald Trump signed a Congressional Review Act resolution Thursday that revokes California’s authority to set tailpipe emissions standards, upending policy in California and 17 other states that tie their standards to that of the Golden State.California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Democratic attorneys general in 10 other states immediately sued to block enforcement of the law. Through a process that allows Congress to undo recent executive branch rules, the law repeals a U.S. Environmental Protection Act waiver allowing California to set a schedule for emissions standards for cars and trucks.Trump signed two other resolutions that repeal the state’s authority to ban sales of new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035 and to regulate emissions on heavy trucks.At a White House signing ceremony, Trump said the law would allow greater consumer choice and lead to less expensive vehicles.“Your cars are going to cost you $3,000, $4,000 less and you're going to have what you want,” he said. “Again, you can get any car you want.”Simple majority voteThe procedure used to pass the law was controversial because of the use of the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, which allows a simple majority vote in the U.S. Senate instead of the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold.Both the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the EPA waiver was not a rule and that the CRA could not be used. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune used the procedure anyway, and the measure passed 51-46.The states suing over the law argued that process was illegal, saying that the CRA was “deemed inapplicable by every nonpartisan arbiter and expert who analyzed the question.”“While all fifty States consented—through their Senators—to these expedited procedures for congressional disapproval of federal rules, no State consented to the CRA as a means for Congress to negate state rules,” the Democratic attorneys general wrote. “Nor would any State have done so.”The states joining California in the lawsuit are Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Vermont and Washington.Clean Air ActThe federal Clean Air Act of 1970 generally prohibits states from setting their own air quality standards. But a section of the bedrock environmental law allows California, which had stringent environmental standards at the time the federal law was passed, to set its own standards.While the other 49 states may not set their own standards, any state can adopt California’s standards as its own.That means the law Trump signed Thursday has effects far beyond California’s borders, which the president noted.“The federal government gave left-wing radicals in California dictatorial powers to control the future of the entire car industry, all over the country, all over the world, actually,” he said.The law, which both chambers of Congress passed last month, applies to 17 states that follow California standards. In addition to those suing, those states are Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Wyoming State Rep. John Winter used a racist slur before lawmakers visited the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center, a site memorializing Japanese Americans' forced internment during World War II. 
The post Wyoming lawmaker apologizes for anti-Japanese slur appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming State Rep. John Winter apologized for his use of a racist slur to describe Japanese people before lawmakers visited the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center earlier this week, according to a national news site.
On Tuesday, Winter, chair of the House Agriculture, State and Public Lands Committee, referred to Heart Mountain as “Jap camp,” while informing committee members about what time they had to assemble for the tour. 
The Thermopolis Republican’s use of the slur, which Japanese Americans worked to remove from America’s lexicon after World War II because it was used to dehumanize them, drew condemnation from people involved with Heart Mountain. As outrage over the slur grew this week, Winter apologized Thursday in an email to AsAmNews, a news organization that covers issues of importance to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
“The term that I used just slipped out of my mouth as that is what it has always been referred to in my world as a kid,” Winter wrote, according to the nonprofit news site. “I knew better, and I am sorry. I didn’t mean to upset anyone. The Interpretive Center at Heart Mountain has a great program for disseminating information and I learned a lot that day.”
The Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation issued a press release Thursday saying its members were “grateful for and accept” Winter’s apology.

“I believe that we are all good people and our goal at the Foundation is to educate one person at a time, if necessary, on what happened at our Heart Mountain site back in 1942,” Shirley Ann Higuchi, chair of the foundation’s board, said in a statement. Higuchi had called Winter’s remarks “unfortunate” and said it had left “a sour taste” in the mouths of those involved in hosting lawmakers to the museum that day. 
WyoFile first reported on Winter’s remarks Tuesday. The lawmaker, a member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus who has served in the House since 2019, has not responded to multiple requests from WyoFile, including a voicemail Thursday inquiring about the apology.  
In his statement to AsAmNews, Winter echoed the remarks of his Senate cochairman Tim French, R-Powell, who told WyoFile on Tuesday that both men had grown up in the area, which was populated by World War II veterans who received lands previously held by the federal government as part of the internment center after the war. In their youth, people often referred to the facility by that name, particularly veterans still angry about the brutal Pacific front of the war, French said. But he said he personally had learned as he grew up that the slur was not appropriate. 
Though Winter said the words “just slipped out of my mouth,” video of the meeting shows him pausing before making the remark. Winter used the slur at the end of the day’s debate over agriculture and public land issues at Northwest Community College in Powell, while reminding his colleagues they’ve been invited to Heart Mountain afterward.
“If you’re gonna go to the,” Winter said, before pausing, “Jap camp, that’s what I call it, we need to leave here by about 12:30,” he said with a chuckle.

City officials said the public chargers — located at stations at the Warren Hood Building parking lot on the corner of Pearl Street and State Street, as well as Thalia Mara Hall and Union Station — are free to use for now but didn’t know for how long that would stay the case.
As of 2023, Mississippi had the fewest number of electric vehicles on the road per capita, based on registration data from the U.S. Department of Energy. DOE numbers also show Mississippi has the second fewest public charging stations per capita after Louisiana. 
In 2018, state lawmakers passed an annual fee of $150 for electric car owners and $75 for hybrid vehicles owners as a way of compensating for lost gas tax revenue. 
Below is a map of public charging stations in Jackson listed on the DOE’s website. Electric vehicle owners elsewhere in the state can use the agency’s online tool to find stations near them.
Entergy bought the chargers from Tesla, and the nonprofit Adopt a Charger installed the units through local contractor Lavallee, which will also maintain them for the city. Jackson’s Planning and Development Director Jhai Keeton said the city is paying just $600 a year for the chargers.
Adopt a Charger partners with private companies, in this case Entergy, who want to sponsor charging stations for public use. The nonprofit, according to its website, has also partnered on stations at the Mississippi Children’s Museum and at Hinds Community College in Raymond. 
While there were already several charging stations in Jackson, the ones unveiled Thursday are the first owned by the city. Prior to then, Tupelo had the most charging stations of any Mississippi city with 13, according to DOE data. Hattiesburg and Jackson, not including the new stations, each have 12, and there are 10 in both Biloxi and Gulfport. 
The Mississippi Department of Transportation is using $50 million in federal funds to develop electric vehicle corridors with 30 new stations throughout the state, but those projects are likely one to two years away.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12161034/EV-charging-1.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Another proposal that specifically sought to raise taxes on millionaires, however, was rejected.
All of these were determined by a handful, or in some instances just one, vote. And with such narrow margins, the chambers will be unlikely to overcome a potential veto from Gov. Janet Mills, who has already expressed her opposition.
The advance of these tax changes comes amid the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee finalizing a budget plan to send to the Maine House of Representatives and Senate for approval, and the potential for increased tax revenue could be consequential.  
Advocates and some Democratic lawmakers specifically pushed for the Legislature to adjust taxes as a means to continue to fund the health and child care programs that Mills proposed cutting in her budget proposal.
So far, only some of those proposals have made it into the committee’s budget plan. Notably, the committee rejected Mills’ suggested cuts to childcare worker stipends and Head Start. Meanwhile, the committee included some initiatives to save or raise money, such as rolling back funding for mental health programs and pensions, as well as increasing the cigarette excise tax. 
A change to tax brackets 
Both chambers backed LD 229, which would increase the base of the state’s tax brackets. It would do this by both increasing the number of tax brackets and by adding a top tax bracket for high income earners.
Maine currently has three tax brackets with tax rates of 5.8%, 6.75% and 7.15%. The top tax bracket is currently for any individual making more than $61,600. The bill would add two more brackets for the highest earners, which would be taxed at 7.75% and 8.95%. 
In the Senate, several critics of the bill said that raising tax rates on the wealthiest individuals would drive investors away. Though tax committee co-chair Sen. Nicole Grohowski (D-Hancock) said the state’s tax code is currently “upside down,” asking more proportionately from earners in the middle than those at the top. “This bill is here to fix that,” she said. 
The ideas in this bill are not new, and could lend themselves to a veto, again. 
Mills’ administration testified against the bill during its public hearing, reiterating many of the same concerns the governor had when she vetoed a bill last year that sought to adjust Maine’s tax bracelets by adding a new top tax rate of 8.45% and expanding the lower tax brackets. 
While describing the bill as well intentioned in her veto message, the governor said the bill wouldn’t reduce the tax burden for lower-income people because of the state’s many exemptions, deductions and credits that more people have become eligible for in recent years.
The governor also cited possible state budget challenges if Maine were to increase its reliance on a small number of taxpayers whose income is disproportionately composed of often volatile business. 
Raising taxes on corporations
The other bill both chambers backed is LD 1879, which would raise the tax rate on corporations to support the agricultural economy, though the Mills administration is also opposed to this plan.
Specifically, it would increase the top marginal corporate income tax rate to 10% on income over $3,500,000 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026. This revenue would then be distributed to various funds and programs, such as the dairy stabilization support fund, agricultural marketing loan fund and business recovery and resilience fund, among others.
Michael Allen, associate commissioner for tax policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, testified against the bill on behalf of Mills during the public hearing, noting that it would make Maine’s top marginal corporate income tax rate among the highest in the country. He also noted a number of technical concerns with the proposal. 
While both chambers have now passed LD 1879, it took several attempts for them to get on the same page.
While the House initially passed this bill 77-67, the Senate failed to pass it with a 13-18 vote and subsequently voted against it without a roll call, returning it to the lower chamber in nonconcurrence. 
On Wednesday, House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) tried to recede and concur but his motion failed 65-78. The House then insisted on its vote to pass the bill and the Senate tabled it when it was sent back to that body on Wednesday. 
But on Thursday the Senate changed course, voting 18-16 to recede and concur with the House. 
Rejecting a “millionaire’s tax”
Both chambers narrowly rejected what is commonly referred to as a “millionaire’s tax.” The proposal, LD 1089, was amended to a lower surcharge than initially proposed. 
It would place an income tax surcharge of 2% on the portion of a resident’s taxable income beyond $1 million for single filers, $1.5 million for heads of households and $2 million for married people filing jointly. This revenue would then go toward funding public K-12 education. 
Originally, the bill sought to tax income over $1 million by an additional 4%, which would have mirrored a law recently passed in Massachusetts.
The House failed to pass the measure 70-72 on Wednesday before voting against it without a roll call. The Senate ultimately did the same Thursday, after an initial vote to pass it failed 17-18.
The Mills administration has also testified against this bill.

BRATTLEBORO — Brattleboro Memorial Hospital has cut six administrative posts as it seeks $4 million in reductions and new revenue to balance its $119 million annual budget.
“Unfortunately, creating financial stability at times requires a reduction in force,” hospital President Christopher Dougherty said in an interview Thursday.
The day before, the hospital let go of its director of radiology, senior director of revenue cycle, data scientist, outpatient specialty practice manager and two executive assistants.
“They’re all administrative positions,” Dougherty said of the layoffs at one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers. “None of these are patient-facing positions.”
The hospital announced last month it was exploring 40 “strategies” to save or earn money by the end of its fiscal year Sept. 30. At the time, it listed options ranging from capitalizing on services such as its new MRI machine to continuing a hiring freeze that began April 1, to, at last resort, laying off some of its 520 staffers.

“We believe that we have some tremendous opportunities in enhancing our financial standing,” Dougherty said Thursday without elaborating.
But the hospital president couldn’t rule out more staff cuts.
“Our hopes are that we can avoid these reductions in force, but we certainly can’t guarantee that,” he said.
Brattleboro is relatively small among Vermont’s 14 community hospitals — it ranks eighth in the state for net patient revenue. Like the other hospitals, it is reliant on government reimbursement for Medicaid patients with limited incomes and Medicare patients age 65 or older. Both programs offer lower reimbursements than commercial insurance.
Last fall, the hospital asked the state’s Green Mountain Care Board, a key health system regulator, for a 4.7% increase in what it charges patients with commercial insurance. But the board instead capped any rise to no more than 3.4%, noting Brattleboro instead should reduce “system inefficiencies.”
“We did see an opportunity with some administrative positions to get our staffing in alignment with national benchmarks,” Dougherty said Thursday. “Six probably doesn’t sound like a lot, but they are six members of our community.”
Brattleboro so far is the only Vermont hospital to announce staff cuts this year, but it isn’t alone in wrestling with what the Green Mountain Care Board has called “a health care affordability crisis.”
“We’re committed to doing everything possible to create a sustainable future for the hospital,” Dougherty said. “I do think there’s hope that we are making progress in addressing our financial challenges, and we do have some opportunities to continue to accelerate that, short of reductions in force.”

President Donald Trump sent the rescissions request that led to the House bill to the Republican-controlled Congress earlier this month.Republican Reps. Mark Amodei of Nevada, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Nicole Malliotakis of New York and Mike Turner of Ohio voted against approving the bill along with all of the chamber’s Democrats.Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon and New York Rep. Nick LaLota, both Republicans, switched from opposing to supporting the bill after Speaker Mike Johnson spoke with them on the floor as the vote was held open.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., contended during floor debate that pulling back the funding is the right place to start, but said the GOP will seek to do much more in the months and years ahead.Scalise said PBS and NPR should have to compete against other media organizations without grant funding from the federal government.“There is still going to be a plethora of options for the American people,” Scalise said. “But if they’re paying their hard-earned dollars to go get content, why should your tax dollars only go to one thing that the other side wants to promote? Let everybody go compete on a fair basis.”Maine Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree said every state in the country would feel the impact of eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.“I rise today in strong opposition to the reckless attack on public media contained within this rescissions bill and millions of Americans who rely on and treasure their local public television and radio stations,” Pingree said.Efforts to defund CPB, she said, were the result of Trump’s “agenda against the free press and his authoritarian desire to control the media.”Public media would lose $1.1 billionThe seven-page bill would rescind all funding that Congress approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, a total of $1.1 billion.CPB, which provides grants to public radio and television stations throughout the country, is one of the few programs that receives an advanced appropriation. So the funding elimination envisioned in the House bill would take effect starting on Oct. 1.The legislation revokes more than $8 billion from several foreign aid programs run by the U.S. State Department or the U.S. Agency for International Development.Florida Republican Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, chairman of the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee, said during an interview Wednesday there were extensive talks between GOP lawmakers and the Office of Management and Budget before the Trump administration officially submitted this rescissions request.But Díaz-Balart cautioned there would need to be substantial pre-negotiations ahead of any future rescissions requests for programs within his annual funding bill.“This rescission package — which I've had communication with OMB on — if this passes, we can move forward,” he said. “Now, if you're talking about a potential for future additional rescissions, that could potentially create a problem and tie the president's hands when it comes to dealing with adversaries or helping allies.”Díaz-Balart said that OMB officials hoping to make any additional rescissions requests on foreign aid would need to engage in “a level of coordination that is so detailed, so intense to make sure that nothing comes forward that could potentially hurt the president's ability to really do the America First agenda internationally.”Florida Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel, ranking member on the State-Foreign Operations spending panel, said during floor debate Thursday the bill was an attack on American values and posed a threat to national security.“It’s not charity, it's strategy,” Frankel said of foreign aid. “Don’t take my word for it, military leaders from both parties have warned us for years — if we fail to lead with soft power, we’ll end up paying in blood, bombs and more boots on the ground.”“Cutting foreign assistance will deepen desperation, fuel extremism, push fragile societies toward collapse and when that happens we all pay the price,” she added. “Refugee crises surge, diseases spread, trade routes shut down, our troops and diplomats face greater danger and our homeland security is weakened.”First of many requestsThe House vote took place just one week after the Trump administration sent lawmakers the rescissions request, the first of many proposals the White House budget office plans to submit. The $9.4 billion cancellation proposal represents a small fraction of the roughly $6.8 trillion the federal government spends each year.The recommendation said some of the foreign aid should be cancelled because it supported “programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like ‘family planning’ and ‘reproductive health,’ LGBTQI+ activities, and ‘equity’ programs.”The rescissions request allows the Office of Management and Budget to legally freeze funding on the programs listed for 45 days while lawmakers decide whether to approve the recommendation as is, amend it, or ignore it.The House and Senate must agree to approve the same rescissions bill before mid-July for the changes to take effect. Failure to reach a bicameral agreement before then would require the Trump administration to spend the funding and block the president from requesting the same cancellation for the rest of his term.Rescissions requests are rare since Congress typically negotiates spending levels on thousands of federal programs in the dozen annual spending bills that are then signed by the president.The first Trump administration proposed rescissions in 2018, but the bill never made it through the Senate.The last time Congress actually approved rescinding funding was in 1992 during the George H.W. Bush administration, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.More action in the SenateThe Senate will need to take up the bill before mid-July if it wants to approve any of the spending cuts, though several GOP senators told States Newsroom during brief interviews Wednesday ahead of the House vote they may amend the package, which would require it to go back to the House for final approval before the 45-day clock runs out.Rescissions bills come with a vote-a-rama in the Senate, giving Republicans and Democrats the chance to call up as many amendments as they want for a floor vote. The GOP holds a 53-member majority, so four or more Republicans opposing any element of the bill would likely lead to its removal.Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she will give the rescissions bill “careful consideration.”In a statement released earlier this month just after the White House sent the request to lawmakers, Collins wrote the committee would “carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations.”South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee, said he’s mostly supportive of the rescissions request, though he didn’t rule out offering an amendment to restore full funding for the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, often called PEPFAR.“I think I'll be okay with most of it. I'm concerned about PEPFAR. I'll have to look at that,” Graham said.West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, chairwoman of the spending panel that oversees the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, said she’s planning to evaluate the bill once it arrives.“We’ve got all these other things I’m thinking about. I haven’t even focused on it,” Capito said, referring to ongoing negotiations over the party’s “big, beautiful bill.”Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, said she’s going to “try to” ensure the Corporation for Public Broadcasting keeps its funding.“I’m a supporter of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It’s a lifeline for many of my small, rural communities,"" Murkowski saidKansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran, a senior appropriator, said he’s “trying to figure out a strategy of how to deal with” both the foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting provisions once the bill comes over from the House.“I'm looking at both of them to see what the right outcome should be.”'The risk of living in a news desert'Both PBS and NPR released statements following the House vote, pledging to do their best to keep their funding intact.Katherine Maher, NPR president and CEO, wrote in a statement the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is essential to the organization.""Americans who rely on local, independent stations serving communities across America, especially in rural and underserved regions, will suffer the immediate consequences of this vote,"" Maher wrote. ""If rescission passes and local stations go dark, millions of Americans will no longer have access to locally owned, independent, nonprofit media and will bear the risk of living in a news desert, missing their emergency alerts, and hearing silence where classical, jazz and local artists currently play.”Paula Kerger, president and CEO at PBS, wrote in a separate statement the “fight to protect public media does not end with this vote, and we will continue to make the case for our essential service in the days and weeks to come.“If these cuts are finalized by the Senate, it will have a devastating impact on PBS and local member stations, particularly smaller and rural stations that rely on federal funding for a larger portion of their budgets. Without PBS and local member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis.”",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

We don't shrink it."" (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)An Assembly committee approved a bill that would create a state counterpart to the federal Voting Rights Act in what supporters said was a bid to protect New Jersey’s democracy from growing federal assaults.
The measure would create a new independent office, housed in Treasury, to oversee elections where the voting rights or powers of racial and language minorities are limited. The Assembly Oversight, Reform, and Federal Relations Committee approved it Thursday in a 4-1 vote with an abstention from Assemblyman Michael Torrissi (R-Burlington).
“At a time when voting rights are under attack across the country, New Jersey must lead and continue to lead the way. This particular voter empowerment act … is our chance to send a clear message: Here, we expand Democracy. We don’t shrink it,” said Assemblyman Reginald Atkins (D-Union), the panel’s chair.
The bill would expand state courts’ power over elections, permitting them to change rules that violate the bill’s provisions, redraw voting districts, expand governing bodies, and move some election dates to coincide with higher-turnout state and federal races.
The bill would create preclearance rules at the state level, requiring localities with a history of voter suppression or intimidation to seek approval before enacting election rule changes, mirroring a provision of the federal Voting Rights Act the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in 2013.
Voting and civil rights groups broadly supported the bill, arguing the state needed its own protections amid escalating attacks from President Donald Trump and the waning strength of the federal law, which courts have repeatedly denuded since its enactment in 1965.
“In the past six months, we have seen attacks on voting rights at the federal level accelerate, including the Department of Justice dropping critical legal cases that aim to protect against racial discrimination in voting,” said Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey. “We know that these threats are real, and we know that state-level VRAs are a powerful tool to curtail them.”
They praised a language-access provision that would require local officials to print translated election materials — including ballots, registration forms, and notices, among others — and assistance in languages other than English.
That requirement would kick in if at least 2%, or 4,000, of eligible voters speak a language other than English and have limited English proficiency. The federal law has a similar provision, but it sets a higher bar, requiring 5% of voting-age citizens with limited English proficiency before kicking in.
“New Jersey is home to over 2 million immigrants. One in four residents is an immigrant, 42.5% of whom are limited-English-proficient, but language access and expanded voted rights do not only impact them. 1.2 million New Jerseyans, regardless of citizenship status, are limited-English-proficient,” said Madison Linton, a fellow at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice.
The New Jersey Association of Election Officials opposed the bill, questioning whether it was needed and cautioning it would give courts broad authority over election administration that, to now, had largely been left with election administrators.
Linda Hughes, the association’s recording secretary and Burlington County’s Republican Board of Elections administrator, warned such court intervention could leave various groups of voters with different election rules and cede some of the legislature’s authority to the judiciary.
“If a court determines that a disparity exists in voter turnout, vote outcomes, or even if they don’t approve of a party’s candidate selection, the judges — the individual judges — can then unilaterally change how those elections are run in certain jurisdictions throughout the state,” she said.
It was unclear how officials could identify discrimination based on a voter’s protected class — in the bill’s case, those in a racial or language minority group — given such information was not recorded on voter registrations, Hughes said.
Some witnesses urged the committee to expand the definition of protected class to include sexual orientation, gender identity, and criminal history.
Residents must provide notice to clerks asserting violations of the bill’s provisions. After receiving the notice, officials are guarded from lawsuits for up to 190 days while they work on fixes, which must be approved by the new voting rights office.
Hughes questioned whether there was even a need for the bill.
“This legislation seems to imply there are voters wanting to vote that are being prevented from participating … We just don’t have any evidence that that’s happening here in New Jersey, so this legislation does seem like it is a bit of a solution in search of a problem that doesn’t exist,” she said.
The New Jersey Institute for Social Justice identified 885 cases of voter intimidation, voter ID, registration, or polling access issues in the state between 2020 and 2024, said Nuzhat Chowdhury, director of its democracy and justice program.
Proponents argued much of the powers the bill, dubbed the John Lewis Voter Empowerment Act after the late Georgia congressman and civil rights leader, would grant to the courts were already available as remedies under the federal Voting Rights Act.
Assemblyman Mike Inganamort (R-Morris), the only lawmaker to vote against it in committee Thursday, largely echoed Hughes’ concerns about the bill. But he added his own reservations about the costs of language-access provisions and questioned reasoning behind leaving enforcement to the new Treasury office rather than the attorney general.
“The attorney general’s office provides counsel that is clear, timely, consistent, and free. That process works. Instead, this legislation calls for a new department, in the Department of Treasury of all places — I guess they have the desk space, I still don’t understand that aspect — that is going to be doing the job the attorney general already does,” Inganamort said.
Enforcement was moved away from the attorney general’s office because state lawyers advise election officials on legal matters, and requiring them to enforce the bill would create a conflict of interest, said Chowdhury.
The measure has not advanced in the Senate since it was introduced there last March.

As a first-generation, low-income student, she needed substantial assistance to be able to attend college. She said the aid she gets from Yale covers 90% of her tuition and expenses. But she fears the changes under a federal tax bill, for higher education institutions and the funds that support financial aid, could put her into debt her senior year.
“I always say that the moment I opened my college acceptance letter changed my life,” she said. “But the reality is that the moment that really changed my life was when I opened my financial aid award.”
One by one, as they spoke outside of the U.S. Capitol, students from Connecticut and elsewhere spoke about how financial aid helped them achieve the dream of going to college without being saddled with massive debt when they graduate.
Connecticut students took the lead in organizing the trip to D.C. to share their stories and meet with U.S. senators who are actively considering and making some changes to President Donald J. Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The trip came together pretty quickly, and 10 days ago, they reached out to office of U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to hold a press conference.
For many of the students who traveled to D.C. this week, they are able to attend college with little expenses because of their schools’ generous financial aid, plus federal student loan programs. Much of that aid is funded by college and university endowments. Yale has one of the largest university endowments, and the current changes in the GOP tax bill could cost the school an estimated $690 million a year.
Emi Glass said Pell Grants, outside scholarship and financial aid from Yale helped her attend college and pursue opportunities like study abroad and an unpaid government internship over the summer “without fear of debt.”
And for Cayla Waddington, she said she needed to aim for an Ivy League school because she would get more financial support from wealthier institutions. The rising sophomore at Yale from West Philadelphia didn’t qualify for enough financial aid at other colleges and would still end up owing at least $30,000.
“I knew my only chance at being able to afford college was to go to a school that had enough money and resources to support me on its own,” Waddington said. “Now, I pay next to nothing for my Yale education, thanks to their endowment. This story isn’t unique to me, and it’s not unique to Yale. There are thousands of us from across the country who share the same story.”
The legislation includes a number of higher education provisions, including changes to student loans and financial assistance.
Since taking office, Trump has sought to reshape the higher education landscape. House Republicans on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee argued that the bill “holds woke, elite universities that operate more like major corporations and other tax-exempt entities accountable, ensuring they can no longer abuse generous benefits provided through the tax code.”
The House-passed bill proposes raising the endowment tax from 1.4% to 21%. While it’s a tiered system and the number will vary by school, Yale is one of the wealthier private institutions that would likely face the highest tax rate.
The Yale students in D.C. on Thursday credited the university’s endowment with providing them with substantial financial aid. Yale provides free tuition for students from households that make under $150,000 a year.
Shortly after the House passed the bill, Yale President Maurie McInnis sent a message to everyone at the school to get involved and call on the Senate to reconsider the hike in the endowment tax. She noted that Yale’s endowment makes up a third of the school’s total revenue and helps provide financial aid — and supports research and some faculty as well.
The federal legislation also seeks cutting or paring back student loan options.
Pell Grant recipients who want to get the maximum amount need to be full-time students. Under the bill, students would need to increase the number of credits they take each semester from 12 to 15 to reach that status. They need to be half-time students to get at least some assistance. But it would also expand these grants in other cases by making short-term vocational training eligible for Pell.
The bill would also reduce the number of existing income-driven repayment plans to pay back student loans and get rid of federal subsidized loans for undergraduates.
Some students worried what the elimination of federal subsidized loans would mean for them if that provision goes into effect in July 2026.
Rebeckah Rubin graduated a few weeks ago from Eastern Connecticut State University and will attend New England Law in Boston in August. She was able to get her degree by relying on subsidized loans and Direct PLUS loans. She warned of “misleading and predatory” private student loan lenders taking advantage of students, especially those who are first-generation.
For the past two days, the group of students has been trying to meet with members of Congress in both parties to lobby against the bill’s higher education provisions. Zach Pan, one of the organizers from Yale, said they reached out to a dozen Republican offices, noting that one student had a meeting with one GOP senator.
Getchell said a group of 25 students went to meetings on Thursday around Capitol Hill. Some of the Connecticut contingent includes at least eight students from Yale as well as some from the University of Connecticut and Eastern Connecticut State University. 
When organizing the visit, she said, the group worked with Yale’s Office of Federal Affairs. The university will also help cover some students’ travel expenses.
Beyond efforts to meet with members of Congress this week, the students said they will be seeking to publish op-eds in local newspapers to bring attention to measures like the endowment tax.
At Thursday’s press conference, Blumenthal, who was joined by U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, said many of the aspects of the bill that face changes were once supported by both Democrats and Republicans.
“It will cap federal student aid and eliminate subsidized loan options that prevent interest from accruing while you’re in school, and when you graduate, it will force you spend more of your income on loan payments,” Blumenthal said. “This reconciliation bill is a dream killer, a job killer, a school killer.”
The House passed the wide-ranging legislation along party lines in late May, and the Senate is now negotiating and drafting its own version.
Because the Senate is likely to make changes, Republicans in both chambers will likely need to reconcile the differences and vote on a compromise bill. The Senate is actively making revisions to some parts of the legislation, including the education piece of it.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4751-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

A virtual public meeting hosted Wednesday evening by the Commission on the Future of Public Education in Vermont was sparsely attended. But the dozen or so people who logged on had plenty to say.
Small schools matter and bring value to their communities, one Twinfield Union School staff member said. Another attendee said school choice should not be expanded. And most said the proposed transformation of public education in Vermont — the outlines of which key lawmakers are debating this week at the Statehouse in Montpelier —  is happening far too quickly, and without much input from the public.
“I just don’t see how, at this time, we should be rushing through a process to make the governor happy, and the (Agency of Education) happy, and the Senate happy, and the House happy, when they haven’t really consulted with the people in the field,” Keri Bristow, the chair of central Vermont’s Mountain Views Supervisory Union board, said during the meeting. 
“I do not think that what’s going through right now is in any way equitable,” Bristow said. “I think it will be a huge detriment to the public school system.”
Wednesday night’s listening session was the final meeting in a series of five that a consultant hired by the commission has held over the last two months. The meeting capped efforts by the commission to gather public opinion about what Vermont’s public education system should look like, at least until it gets more direction from the Legislature.
The creation of the Commission on the Future of Public Education in Vermont was part of 2024’s Act 183, the law that set the double-digit average property tax increases needed that year to keep pace with ballooning public education costs.
The law gave members of the 13-member body, composed of lawmakers and education officials, a wide-ranging charge. Among other things, they were tasked with studying Vermont’s public education system and making recommendations to reduce costs while ensuring equal educational opportunities are afforded to all students, with a final report due in December 2025.
But since its first meeting in August 2024, the commission has lacked buy-in from all sides of the political spectrum, several of its members said. 
Some commission members haven’t shown up to meetings in months, according to commission members and meeting minutes. And after Gov. Phill Scott introduced his sweeping education reform plan in January, the commission struggled to find a role for itself.
“It is relevant that the commission was created in a law that was vetoed and then ultimately overridden. That is relevant to, I think, where we find ourselves,” Meagan Roy, the chair of the commission, said in an interview.
Now, as education reform proceeds, with only minor input from the body, the future of the commission tasked with studying the future of public education in Vermont is, itself, uncertain.
Jay Nichols, the executive director of the Vermont Principals Association and a member of the commission, said, “I feel a little bit like we’ve been floundering.”

‘Up in the air’
The commission delivered its preliminary findings on how to rein in public education costs in December. But the group shied away from offering specific recommendations on how to contain costs in the short term.
The document offered an assessment of the situation facing public education in Vermont, along with some key education data trends. Roy, a former superintendent, said in an interview that there were commission members who were disappointed that the report did not have cost containment recommendations. But she noted that the report found the issue was “more complicated than short-term cost containment.
“We really aren’t going to make wise decisions by focusing on the short term,” she said.
A month after the commission’s report was shared, Scott released his sweeping reform plan, calling for the consolidation of Vermont’s 119 school districts down to as few as five regional administrative districts.
“That pretty much changed everything, because at that point, the commission and everybody else was responding to the governor’s plan,” Nichols said, adding that he felt the commission was “bypassed” by Scott’s proposed timeline.
Since then, the commission has turned its focus toward a public engagement campaign. The commission began holding meetings for public input around the state, and later hired Afton Partners, a consulting group, to host virtual listening sessions and to gather the input provided for the commission and lawmakers. The group has so far been paid $24,375 for its work, according to Toren Ballard, a spokesperson for the state Agency of Education.
“At every meeting, we have citizens that come up and say things like, ‘Please keep this commission going, because it’s one place we feel like we can really be heard,'” Nichols said. “But until final legislation is settled on between the House and Senate and the governor… I mean, we could end up with not having a commission. And there’s several of us that have said publicly, including myself, that I don’t want to be part of a commission unless it’s doing real work.”
Peter Conlon, the House Education Committee chair who is part of the legislative negotiations and a sitting member of the commission, said his hope moving forward is that “we can better focus” the commission’s public outreach campaign “to provide really good public information to the Legislature come January.”
“The Legislature, which created the commission to begin with, would be best served by the commission really capitalizing on its outreach in terms of, what do Vermonters think of this new vision of Vermont, how it should operate, how it can best serve Vermonters,” he said in an interview.
The committee by law is scheduled to release a final report with recommendations for public education reform by December. But that has been difficult to home in on, Conlon said, because the commission’s future role “has been very much up in the air.”
In the current version of H.454 proposed by the House members, the commission remains, but lawmakers have refined its focus to address “the state of future larger districts, the role of school boards in those future larger districts, and the role of the electorate,” Conlon said while introducing that section to the conference committee on Wednesday.
The bill finalized by the conference committee would go to the full Legislature for a vote and then to Scott for his approval.

Low turnout 
Nichols and others admit that the commission has “not had strong turnout” for the in-person and virtual engagement sessions. A presentation by Afton Partners reported that only 18 people had attended the four listening sessions in May.
“It worries me. I think that a lot of the public doesn’t have any clue of what’s going on in the Legislature,” Nichols said.
Roy, in an interview, said the commission struggled with whether to host the virtual sessions at all. 
“Eventually, what the commission decided is that the optics aren’t good for us to talk for months about how important engagement is and then cancel the input sessions. It just didn’t feel right,” she said.
She added that the commission is still pursuing public engagement. “But we’re trying to be honest with participants,” she said. “‘You are informing us as the commission. You’re not necessarily informing the Legislature right now.'”
Conlon in an interview acknowledged the commission’s public sessions “have not been as well publicized as we would like.”
“But we have a lot of time left on the calendar, and once the commission gets settled as to whether it’s continuing with its current statutory framework, or if it’s moving ahead in a new statutory framework, that will help guide that work,” he said.
Roy said the commission remains an important tool for ensuring education reform is done thoughtfully.
“I think the commission is needed more than ever to do this work,” she said. Other states that have undergone systematic transformation, she said, “created a body to monitor how successful it’s been. That’s what I think our role should be.”

June 7, 2025 | Photo by Jon KingState regulators are seeking more information on the impacts of the proposed routes on two transmission line expansion projects that would place many miles of electric service wires across the state.
ITC Holding Corp., doing business as the Michigan Electric Transmission Company, plans to build two approximately 50 mile spans of high-voltage electric transmission lines, one from the Indiana border starting in Branch County to a substation in Calhoun County, and the other stretching from Eaton County to Gratiot County. 
The projects were proposed in 2022 and are slated to cost nearly $850 million. They have been hailed by supporters as some of the first transmission line projects approved by MISO, a midwestern power grid operator, which could help bolster Michigan’s electric grid.
But the situation has some residents grappling with the possibility of an electricity rate increase that could affect all Michiganders, as well as concerns that their land might be seized in the process.
For now, those residents were given somewhat of a reprieve as the Michigan Public Service Commission on Thursday asked for additional briefings on the proposed routes.

The company in 2024 applied for certificates of public convenience and necessity on the projects, which were up for discussion at Thursday’s meeting.
Commissioners noted evidence showing the company’s proposed route between Branch and Calhoun counties runs through a rural airport, although an alternative proposed route sidesteps the airport but requires more new right-of-way allowance.
Members of the commission asked for supplemental briefs on the reasonableness of the route’s impact on the airport and the overall social impacts of the proposed alternative route.
Those briefs are due back to the commission June 26.
In a statement to Michigan Advance, the company said it will continue to work with the commission on the certificates.
“These Tranche 1 projects are part of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, Long-Range Transmission Plan, or LRTP, which will improve grid reliability and resiliency, support state economic development efforts and enable the safe and reliable movement of power to Michigan communities,” the company said. “ITC looks forward to continuing our work with agencies, municipalities and landowners.”
Community members who would be affected by the transmission lines spoke in opposition to the project during public comment at the end of the meeting.
Robert Williams, the owner of the airport in question, said the proposed lines go directly across his rural airfield located just south of Marshall. He said he has been in contact with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and that the agency is pursuing his concerns about an electric transmission line running across a federally-registered airport.
The team is investigating if an alternative route is available to the [the company],” Williams said. “[A proposed alternative] does not change the entire route. It only changes a small section.”
Williams added that, in his conversation with federal regulators, the subject of burying the transmission lines was discussed and said it could be done.
“That is a precedent that’s been set before the varied transmission lines up to 720,000 volts,” Williams said. “These are 345,000 volts.”
Peter Sullivan also commented on the project. His mother, Margot Sullivan, lives in Fowler and owns 80 acres of centennial farmland in a section of the proposed route.
Although the commission did not approve the project and sought additional information on Thursday, Sullivan said he and others will continue to demand that the company move the overall right-of-way from properties in the proposed route by 50 feet. He said their demands also include the company not using virgin land to make new easements or rights-of-way and instead use existing rights-of-way.
Union City resident Jake Wages said he hopes the commission would not approve the project after getting additional information based on the number of centennial farms and agricultural farms that are in the way of the proposed route. Wages claimed that the company has not been transparent with residents. He said he has had numerous conversations with those potentially affected by the lines in Branch and Calhoun counties and that not one of them has said they agreed to terms with the company on giving up their land.
“The contract is so lopsided that anybody with any common sense wouldn’t even consider signing it,” Wages said. “They want to put in there that any equipment that is on our property belongs to them, and if something happens to it, we’re liable for it. At that point, who’s liable for any contamination? We’re responsible for their vehicles, their maintenance, cleaning up their mess. They want access to our property [around the clock] without any type of notification.”

,DC,2025-06-12 20:42:22+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Small business owners from rural America urge Congress to keep clean energy tax credits,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/small-business-owners-rural-america-urge-congress-keep-clean-energy-tax-credits,,"WASHINGTON — Small business owners and community leaders from rural regions in Western states including Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah pressed lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week to preserve clean energy tax credits on the chopping block in the Republicans’ “one big beautiful” mega-bill, now in the Senate.The suite of investment, production and residential tax credits enacted and expanded under the Democrats’ own big budget reconciliation bill in 2022, titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of reducing the effects of climate change.The credits have spurred hundreds of billions in investment dollars in advanced manufacturing and production since 2022, and contributed to job creation, largely in states that elected President Donald Trump to a second term.Small business operators and community leaders from rural and mountainous areas of the United States that have benefited from the boom in alternative energy sources say the campaign to end the tax credits will also cause job losses and cut options for consumers.Solar projects in AlaskaChase Christie, director of development for Alaska Solar LLC, said his company installs four to five large-scale solar projects per year in remote Alaskan villages and also fits and services smaller residential solar installations.“They take a lot of planning, a lot of logistics,” Christie told States Newsroom in an interview Wednesday.“For going into a remote village where there's tundra, we might need to go there in the dead of winter so we can work on frozen ground,” he added. “Other places we won't go until summer. So we have these large gaps in between these larger projects, and a company like ours absolutely relies on the residential installations to keep our workforce going.”Christie, who met Tuesday with staffers for Alaska’s Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said in January he let a handful of workers go and paused most new hiring.“Our workforce is roughly half of what it usually is just because we're not sure which direction things are going to go,” he said.Christie was among a dozen small energy business owners, municipal government officials and nonprofit employees focused on energy options for low-income households who States Newsroom spoke to Wednesday.A spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement: “Senator Sullivan supports energy projects that lower costs for Alaska. The Senator and his team have been meeting with a number of Alaskans about energy tax credits. As we wait for text from the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator is working with his colleagues to ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between promoting stable and predictable tax policy, advancing projects that benefit Alaska, and addressing the need to reduce the federal deficit.”Murkowski’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Elimination of tax creditsSenators are hashing out language for the massive Republican agenda bill that will extend and expand the 2017 tax law, costing roughly $3.8 trillion, and cut spending in other areas to offset the price tag.A contingent of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam,” won on accelerating the expiration of the energy tax credits and tightening restrictions on eligibility as a way to pay for individual and corporate tax cuts that Trump campaigned on.The language in a section of the House bill, passed 215-214 on May 22, titled “Working Families Over Elites,” terminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, worth up to $3,200 for homeowners who make energy upgrades to their property.Among the slate of other affected IRA tax credits, the House bill also speeds up the expiration of the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a credit dating back decades that was updated in 2022.The credit is available to taxpayers who invest in “energy property,” including solar installations to provide electricity and heat, fuel cells, small wind turbines, geothermal pumps, and other electricity-producing technologies. House Republicans wrote provisions to eliminate the credit for facilities placed into service after 2028 and end eligibility for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.The credit is worth up to 30% of the cost of the project, plus two bonus credits up to 10% each if the project includes mostly domestically produced material and if it’s located in an “energy community,” meaning a place where a coal plant has closed or where unemployment reaches a certain threshold.The bill also repeals a taxpayer’s ability to transfer the tax credits as a way to finance a project, and introduces restrictions on foreign-made components that industry professionals say essentially makes the credit unworkable.Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated, as of June 4, the elimination of the clean energy investment and production tax credits will save roughly $249 billion over the next decade.Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a right-of-center think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Thursday in a new analysis that “The final House bill makes impressive cuts to the IRA green energy tax credits, but it does so in part by introducing more complexity.”The group is advocating for senators to reduce the tax credit rates and make clearer complicated language, like the provision around “foreign entities of concern.”Keeping on the heat during a Montana winterBut Logan Smith, weatherization program manager for the Human Resource Development Council in central Montana, argues the credits have been a lifeline for lower-income rural residents.“If I can get solar panels on each of the clients’ homes, that means that their power is going to stay on in the middle of winter,” Smith said. “Because every winter we plan for losing power for about a week, that's just something we grew up with. … But if we have solar panels, the power stays on, the heat stays on.”Ralph Waters, owner of SBS Solar in Missoula, Montana, became emotional when talking about how an early termination of the tax credits could slow his business and result in having to lay off half his workforce.He criticized the politicization of the tax incentives.“Montana is deeply red, but it's also a very practical place. And so green energy renewables becomes a taboo phrase somehow,” Waters said. “The practical energy needs are undeniable, and so if we can get past our disagreements about the phraseology and realize that it's electrons, watts, and amps. And it’s cheaper.”The offices of Montana GOP Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy did not respond to a request for comment.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana voters will get to weigh in next on whether civil service protections should be removed from certain state employees, though it’s not certain the measure will result in current government workers losing their status. 
Senate Bill 8, sponsored by Sen. Jay Morris. R-West Monroe, received final passage Wednesday in the Senate on a 28-9 party-line vote. 
The proposal is a constitutional amendment that will be placed on a ballot April 18, 2026, pending approval of a separate bill to set that election date. 
Morris’ bill would give state lawmakers power that currently rests with the Civil Service Commission, a seven-member independent review panel that oversees the hiring, promotion and firing of 39,000 “classified” state workers. The commission, working with state agencies on staffing goals, has the power to create and eliminate job positions and decide which jobs should have a protected status and which should not. 
Classified employees enjoy some degree of protection against politically motivated or otherwise unfair terminations and disciplinary practices because they have the right to appeal such decisions to the Civil Service Commission, which has the final say on staffing matters for most state agencies. 
Although there was debate and confusion earlier in the week over whether the bill would apply to current classified employees or just future-hires, Morris said in an interview Thursday it could affect current employees “to a degree.”
“Obviously, it can affect future employees. That’s obvious,” he said. “But it can affect existing employees.”
The degree to which it will affect current employees would depend on how the Legislature decides to use the amendment if voters adopt it. Morris said lawmakers would still need to pass a new statute that contains those specifics.  
“Any bill passed would have to be carefully constructed to avoid any issues of an unconstitutional taking” of an existing employee’s job, he said.
Steven Procopio, president of the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR), a state government watchdog group, said the amendment would give lawmakers power to determine which state employees should be removed from classified civil service. 
Whether they choose to take it that far remains to be seen, he said.
“Does it affect current employees?” Procopio said. “I think it’s technically possible. You can do it, but there has to be due process applied.”
There is a legal precedent from a court case that could require some level of due process before currently classified employees can be fired, he added.
“PAR is for civil service reforms, but I am concerned this doesn’t provide enough safeguards,” Procopio said.
At any rate, the matter could end up in court before the election over the proposal’s ballot language, which does not mention the “classified” civil service and could mislead voters into thinking it doesn’t apply to those workers. 
The ballot language states: “Do you support an amendment to allow the legislature to remove or add officers, positions, and employees to the unclassified civil service?”
Lawmakers based the ballot language off of a current constitutional provision that states: “Additional positions may be added to the unclassified service and those positions may be revoked by rules adopted by a commission.”
All state employees are classified unless their job falls under one of the 13 unclassified positions listed in the Louisiana Constitution. 
“I think that the ballot language could be misleading,” Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, said, noting that the state constitution specifically allows for legal challenges in such situations.

President Donald Trump has ordered one of the nation’s largest-ever military parades to take place in Washington, D.C., this weekend, coinciding with Flag Day and his own 79th birthday. In response, the grassroots anti-Trump 50501 movement has planned protests across the nation. 
In Vermont, Saturday’s events include a border-to-border anti-Trump flag parade that plans to travel up Route 7 from Massachusetts to Canada, allowing Vermonters on the route to honk and wave as the parade passes by. At least 15 communities outside of the parade route are planning their own anti-Trump protests. 
Some rallies have special activities planned along with the protests. In Middlebury, St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church plans to conduct a dramatic reading of the one-act play “Paul Revere Resists.” In Charlotte, protesters are invited to hike to the top of Mount Philo to display their signs and flags at the summit.

At least one pro-Trump event has been announced so far. The Vermont Republican Party has listed a “Celebration of Flag day, Army’s 250’s Anniversary & Birthday” on its website, to take place at the Statehouse lawn in Montpelier — the same location as the city’s 50501’s anti-Trump rally.

Jim Justice (R-WV) speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on March 25, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images)As legislation cutting a food assistance program that helps feed thousands of state residents makes its way through Congress, several advocacy groups, businesses and organizations are calling on West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice to speak against the plan. 
“Given that SNAP is the most effective anti-hunger program in the state, we ask that you oppose structural changes, cuts and efforts to weaken SNAP,” an open letter to Justice reads. “Cutting SNAP would have devastating consequences for the 278,978 children, parents, older adults, veterans, people with disabilities and others in our state who rely on the program to keep hunger at bay.
“The research is clear: SNAP improves health outcomes, reduces child hospitalizations and developmental delays and supports educational success. It also decreases health care spending and helps stabilize families during times of crisis and job loss,” they wrote.
The letter from the American Friends Service Committee Wednesday is signed by nearly 60 West Virginia food banks, small businesses, congregations and organizations.
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would cut the Supplemental Food Nutrition Program by $300 billion through 2034 and push a portion of the cost of the program to the states to backfill. The program currently is funded solely by the federal government. States split the cost of administering the program with the federal government.
The Senate Agriculture Committee, of which Justice is a member, this week took up its portion of the Republican tax and budget reconciliation legislation. The bill has yet to be voted on by the full Senate. If the Senate passes the bill, the House of Representatives would need to sign off on any changes the Senate makes.
The latest version of the legislation would still push some of the cost of SNAP onto the states, but would penalize states less harshly than the version the House of Representatives passed last month.  
Under the House bill, the federal government would shift between 5 to 25% of the cost of SNAP benefits to state governments beginning in 2028 depending on their payment error rate. That version of the bill could put West Virginia on the hook for $28 million and up to about $141 million, depending on the state’s error rate. 
In the Senate Agriculture Committee’s version, most states would be required to pay between 5 and 15% of the food benefits program beginning in 2028. Only those with an error rate of 6% would have to pay for the program, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
The Senate proposal would have West Virginia paying up to $84 million, according to the analysis. 
“The cuts and cost shifts in the House bill would lead to greater food insecurity and place even greater pressure on our food banks and charities, which already struggle to meet demand,” the letter says. “For every one meal provided by a food bank, SNAP provides nine. Our state’s charitable food system cannot fill the gap that would be created by the magnitude of these cuts.”
Justice this week told a reporter that cutting SNAP could cost Republicans’ their supermajority. 
“If we don’t watch out, people are going to get hurt, people are going to be upset. It’s going to be the No.1 thing on the nightly news all over the place,” Justice said in an interview with Politico Tuesday. “And then, we could very well awaken to a situation in this country where the majority quickly becomes the minority.”
When a West Virginia Watch reporter asked a Justice spokesman for comment on the letter, he referred her to Justice’s comments to Politico. 
The Senate bill also makes changes to the work requirement exceptions. Historically, SNAP recipients with children have not been subject to work requirements for the program. The House version of the bill expanded work requirements to parents of children age 7 and up. In the Senate version, parents of children age 10 and up are subject to the requirements, said Kelly Allen, director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. 
The Senate bill also gets rid of work requirement exemptions for people including veterans, homeless people and gives states more flexibility to issue exemptions on a case by case basis, Allen said. 
Overall, the Senate agriculture committee is just “tinkering around the edges” with the bill that passed in the House last month, Allen said.
“It’s still the largest cut to SNAP in history,” she said. “It’s still a dramatic expansion of bureaucratic barriers that will result in people losing food assistance, including households with children. And it still abandons that commitment to federally funding SNAP benefits and likely creates pretty significant burden for state lawmakers in the state budget at a time when the state budget is already crunched.”

Dan McKee said in a statement Wednesday. “We know there is still much work ahead, but the steps we are taking are […]","Publicly-accessible Boxes containing Naloxone, an opioid reversal drug also known by the brand name Narcan, line up outside the East Bay Recovery Center in Warren. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island saw its lowest number of fatal drug overdoses since 2020, according to health department data presented to the Governor’s Overdose Task Force on Wednesday.
“This is a sign of hope,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement Wednesday. “We know there is still much work ahead, but the steps we are taking are saving lives.” 
This is the second year in a row that overdose deaths have dropped. There were 329 Rhode Islanders who died from overdoses in 2024, representing an 18.6% decrease from 2023, and a 25% drop compared to 2022. That means the state is well on its way to achieving its goal of a 30% reduction for 2030. The goal was set in 2022, the year a total of 436 people died of drug overdoses.  
The 2024 data demonstrated another longstanding trend now broken: For the first time since 2013, cocaine-related deaths were implicated in 61% of fatal overdoses, surpassing the 57% of deaths associated with fentanyl. 
All opioid-related overdoses, in fact, fell from 85% the previous year to 69% in 2024.
But more than one substance can contribute to an overdose, so distinguishing the role of cocaine or fentanyl in a death is not so neatly accomplished. A large portion of overdoses — 118 in all — involved both substances being used in tandem in 2024. About three in five people who died from cocaine also had fentanyl in their system.   
The annual overdose data is compiled and interpreted by the Rhode Island Department of Health’s (RIDOH) Substance Use Epidemiology Program, which finished reviewing the 2024 results last week, according to Joseph Wendelken, a department spokesperson. 
The data is largely based on autopsy and toxicology findings from the Office of the State Medical Examiners. Personal medical history also informs the coroners’ findings. The data does not include deaths with undetermined causes.
“Though decline is encouraging, this is still an incredible loss in our community,” Heidi Weidele, the health department’s lead fatal overdose epidemiologist, told the task force Wednesday during her presentation on the data.
  A slide from the Rhode Island Department of Health’s presentation on fatal overdoses in 2024 shows trends since 2009. (Rhode Island Department of Health)
The scale of loss did not affect all people equally: 70% of overdose deaths in 2024 were men, a number consistent with recent years. Similarly, people ages 45 to 54 were the largest age-based cohort of overdose deaths, followed by people ages 55 to 64.
By race, non-Hispanic white Rhode Islanders comprised the largest share of overdoses at 73%, even though they were also most likely to have a history of substance use treatment.
Most of the state’s overdoses were concentrated in urban areas, with Woonsocket, Providence and Pawtucket reporting the highest numbers.










Though decline is encouraging, this is still an incredible loss in our community. 


– Heidi Weidele, lead fatal overdose epidemiologist, Rhode Island Department of Health


Weidele said the deceased most commonly worked in “natural resources, construction, maintenance, and service occupations, which is similar to what we’ve seen in past years,” she told the task force. “And service occupations would be things like health care support, law enforcement, food preparation, grounds maintenance, and personal care.”
Other statistics from the report painted a grim picture of the deceased leading up to final moments: Most never sought substance use treatment, or received medical treatment for a previous overdose. 
Eight out of 10 died in private, in a home, garage or camper. Most overdosed alone, with no bystander present in 60% of cases.
Illicit and prescription drugs
The availability of lethal drugs has also influenced overdose trends over the years. In 2009, prescription drugs accounted for 62% of overdose deaths. By 2020, prescription drugs accounted for only 9% of fatal overdoses, while illicit drugs like fentanyl and cocaine comprised 72% of overdose deaths.
In 2024, the state actually saw 34% of deaths attributed to combinations of illicit and prescription drugs combined — the highest percentage since at least 2009.
A few uncommon culprits in overdose deaths were still marked as “substances of concern” by the state health department. These included novel benzodiazepines, tranquilizers which belong to the much broader category of research chemicals — substances derived from or chemically very similar to legal and regulated drugs. In this case, novel benzodiazepines like clonazolam — about two-and-a-half-times stronger than Xanax — accounted for nine fatalities in 2024.
Brown University researcher: Street drugs are getting more potent and more mysterious

Xylazine, a veterinary anesthetic increasingly being used to cut street-sourced opioids, was another rogue substance that continued to impact overdose data in 2024. It was involved in 37% of opioid-related deaths.
“Every single overdose death is preventable,” Health Department Director Dr. Jerry Larkin said in a statement Wednesday. “Recovery is within reach for every person living with the disease of addiction.”
McKee strengthened the Overdose Task Force — a coalition of more than 150 members divvied up into nine workgroups — in 2022 via an executive order, hoping to ensure a sustained state response to the opioid overdose crisis. Among the initiatives it steers are determining how to dispense opioid settlement funds, naloxone distribution networks, peer outreach, and recovery support and public awareness campaigns. 
Earlier this year, Rhode Island also opened the nation’s first state-regulated harm reduction site at Project Weber/RENEW in south Providence, where people can use drugs and receive medical attention in the event of an overdose. Despite a fierce floor debate in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, legislation to extend the injection site’s pilot authorization was extended by the General Assembly and later signed into law by McKee on June 6.

(Photo courtesy of Raise the Wage Oklahoma)OKLAHOMA CITY – Legal challenges were filed Wednesday aimed at a recent law that puts more restrictions on the process voters use to get issues on the ballot.
The suits were filed with the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
Gov. Kevin Stitt in May signed Senate Bill 1027, which took effect immediately.
The new law requires those circulating a petition for a statutory change to get signatures that amount to no more than 11.5% of the votes cast in a single county in the most recent gubernatorial election. The threshold increases to 20.8% for a constitutional amendment.
The law effectively forces signature gatherers to visit several Oklahoma counties rather than concentrating on high-population areas.
Prior to the law, there were no restrictions or caps on signatures from any county.
Under the new law, those seeking to place items on the ballot would be prohibited from paying petition circulators based on the number of signatures collected. The law requires sources of payment to circulators to be disclosed and bars out-of-state interests from donating.
Petition circulators would have to be registered voters.
It requires a political appointee, the Secretary of State, to approve the gist, which is the brief summary of the ballot measure that voters see at the top of the signature sheet.
One suit challenges the overall constitutionality of the law, saying it imposes an undue burden.
The suit seeks to put the law on hold until the legal dispute is resolved.
It says the law effectively nullifies “the right of the initiative petition” and violates the First Amendment.
It slashes the available signature pool by 95%, “making ballot qualification virtually impossible while advancing no legitimate state interest,” the suit said.
The suit was filed by two proponents of State Question 836, which seeks to make Oklahoma primaries open. A rural voter and a member of a group that has been highly critical of plans to build a turnpike in the Norman area also are plaintiffs.
Secretary of State Josh Cockroft and Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond as defendants in both suits.
The second suit challenges the ability to make the law retroactive.
A petition seeking to open the state’s primaries, State Question 836, is already in the works and was filed before the measure became law. 
“This law doesn’t just bend the rules in favor of powerful politicians — it breaks them entirely for Oklahoma voters,” said Dr. Ken Setter, a plaintiff in both suits and proponent of State Question 836. “Oklahoma’s Constitution gives us the right to petition our government. Senate Bill 1027 strips that right away.”
The new law gives the executive branch veto power over citizen initiatives, the suit said.
The measure makes it more difficult and costly to get an issue on the ballot and would deter future efforts, the suit said.
When State Question 836 was filed, there were no geographic requirements for signatures and no caps, the suit said.
“Retroactive application of SB 1027 substantially undercuts Oklahoma citizens’ ability to exercise their reserved right of initiative petition,” the suit says. 
The initiative petition process has been used to expand Medicaid, enact criminal justice reform and legalize medical marijuana.
Lawmakers have repeatedly declined to expand Medicaid or legalize medical marijuna.
Supporters of the new law have said it is needed to garner more input from rural counties and to prevent fraud.

California Insurance Department formally investigating State Farm over ‘significant’ number of complaints about its handling of claims from L.A. fire survivors.


California’s Insurance Department has launched a formal investigation into State Farm over its handling of claims from the Los Angeles County fires. 
The investigation, expected to take months, will allow for a more comprehensive regulatory review, the department said in a press release today. Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in the release that the review will help determine whether State Farm has complied with the state’s consumer-protection and claims-handling laws.
“No one should be left in uncertainty, forced to fight for what they are owed, or face endless delays that often lead consumers to give up,” Lara said.
Survivors of the January fires and lawmakers who represent them had urged the commissioner to open the investigation into the state’s largest provider of property insurance. 
Residents of Pasadena and Altadena have complained about delays in payments; being assigned multiple claims adjusters; having to fight to be reimbursed for smoke damage; and more. His staff will also investigate inconsistent management of similar claims and poor record-keeping, Lara said. 
“I’m happy to hear the commissioner has chosen to look deeper,” said Andrew Wessels, whose Altadena home has smoke damage, high levels of lead and more. “But I’ll believe stuff when I see it on any of these things.”
Wessels, his wife and two children have lived in seven different places since the Eaton Fire. He told CalMatters today that he is waiting on at least $25,000 in reimbursements from State Farm, and has not yet bothered to submit “a bunch” more requests for reimbursement because it seems futile at this moment. Last week, the insurer assigned him a new adjuster — the fourth so far.
State Farm said it is cooperating with the investigation.
“A fair review will find that thousands of State Farm customers are being helped by our teams on the ground in Los Angeles County and are very satisfied,” said Sevag Sarkissian, spokesperson for State Farm. He said the company has paid more than $3.96 billion on more than 12,000 claims by its California customers as of this week.
As part of the investigation, the insurance department is asking State Farm customers to continue to submit complaints. The department has so far received hundreds of claims related to the LA-area fires, a significant number of which are about State Farm, department spokesperson Gabriel Sanchez said today. 
Formal investigations by the insurance department are known as market-conduct examinations. They have resulted in correcting insurance companies’ practices, said department spokesperson Michael Soller.

SPRINGFIELD – In a year when many state agencies received little or no funding increase, state lawmakers this year approved an increase of $15.7 million, or 22.4%, for general operating expenses in Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s office.

That General Revenue Fund increase is significantly more than some other constitutional officers received for their operating expenses in the upcoming fiscal year. It’s also more than the $15 million that Raoul himself requested when he appeared before House and Senate appropriations committees this year – although reductions in revenue from other state funds left Raoul’s all-funds budget roughly flat from a year ago.

Raoul’s office did not respond to repeated requests to comment for this story about why lawmakers approved a larger general operating budget than he had requested, and why the budget reflected such significant cuts in two specific non-GRF funds.

During budget hearings in April, Raoul said he needed additional funding to hire attorneys and other staff to handle the increased workload that his office now manages. Some of that workload, he said, is the result of legislation that has given the attorney general’s office more responsibility.

But he also mentioned the increased workload that stems from more than a dozen lawsuits his office has joined challenging actions of the Trump administration as well as defending the state against legal actions the administration has filed against Illinois.

“This budget will support supplying the requisite attorneys to step up where the federal government is stepping away, as well as attorneys involved in critical cases to protect our state’s interests,” Raoul told a House budget committee.

At the time of those hearings, Raoul’s office declined requests by Capitol News Illinois to provide specific information about how many new attorneys or other staff it intended to hire with the additional money.

“We can’t give a specific number of staff we will be hiring but the requested $15 million increase in GRF funding will allow us to have a stable source of funding to adequately respond to both costs associated with supporting the attorneys defending ongoing federal challenges as well as new and longstanding state laws,” Raoul’s spokesperson Drew Hill said in an April 17 email.

According to the budget bill lawmakers passed on the final day of the legislative session, Raoul’s office will receive $85.7 million in General Revenue Fund money “to meet its operational expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026.” That’s up from $70 million that was provided in the same line item in the fiscal year 2025 budget bill.

By comparison, lawmakers approved an increase of just under $1 million, or 3%, in the comptroller’s general operating budget. And they approved an increase of about $2.4 million, or 5.7%, in non-GRF funds for the operating budget of the state treasurer’s office.

The attorney general’s budget includes several line items that are also funded with GRF money. Those include specific funding for the office’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit and the Child Support Enforcement Division. They also include funding for various grants for organized retail crime enforcement and grants under the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Act.

All told, lawmakers approved a total GRF budget for the attorney general’s office next year of $116.05 million, an increase of $10.75 million, or 10.2%, over this year’s budget.

The office also receives appropriations of revenue from sources other than the General Revenue Fund, such as the Illinois Gaming Law Enforcement Fund, the Cannabis Expungement Fund and the Illinois Tobacco Fund that are earmarked for specific purposes.

It also receives appropriations from two funds that receive money from court-ordered and voluntary settlements of consumer protection lawsuits and from civil penalties that are paid to the attorney general’s office. By statute, both funds may be used, subject to appropriations, for the “exercise of the duties of the Attorney General.”

The budget lawmakers just approved for the upcoming fiscal year reflects a combined $16.9 million reduction in appropriations from those two funds.

As a result, the total “all funds budget” for the attorney general’s office next year comes to about $194.465 million, which is just $700,000 more than this year’s budget.

Jordan, at 79 the state’s oldest and longest serving death row inmate, was first convicted in 1976 for kidnapping and killing Edwina Marter in Harrison County. He had four trials until a death sentence stuck in 1998. 
On Thursday, eight of the nine justices of the Mississippi Supreme Court declined to rehear an order to set Jordan’s execution date. Justice Leslie King was the lone person who wanted to grant a rehearing. 
This decision comes about a week after Jordan’s attorney, Krissy Nobile of the Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel, wrote to the court to emphasize that her client has not yet exhausted federal remedies and an execution could not be set. 
The U.S. Supreme Court distributed Jordan’s petition for a writ of certiorari at a May 29 conference and is expected to discuss it again at a June 18 conference – a week before the execution. 
Meanwhile, Jordan’s attorneys filed an emergency application for a stay of execution with Justice Samuel Alito Jr. pending the court’s disposition on the case. 
They argue there is a reasonable prospect that the court will grant certiorari and reverse the Mississippi Supreme Court’s decision, and that Jordan will suffer irreparable harm if a stay is not ordered. 
In its response, the state argues Jordan has been trying to avoid his death sentence for almost 50 years and that he is repeating baseless arguments in his pending petition for certiorari. 
His attorneys argue Jordan’s death sentence is not valid because in 1976, when the murder was committed and Jordan was sentenced, Mississippi and all other states had ceased executions based on a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Furman v. Georgia that capital punishment was unconstitutional.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/06115731/e004b-carroll_gartin_justice_building_-_mississippi_supreme_court.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

What’s not average is the uncertainty over whether government-backed efforts to reduce its size will falter as the Trump administration scales back federal agencies involved in the process.,"An aerial view of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on June 7, 2024. Nutrients from throughout the Mississippi River basin wash down into the Gulf of Mexico, creating an annual “dead zone” of low oxygen conditions. Aerial support provided by SouthWings. Credit: La’Shance Perry, The Lens Annual forecasts for the Gulf “dead zone” at the mouth of the Mississippi River predicts the section of water with low oxygen levels will be about average in size this year. 
What’s less certain is whether government efforts to reduce its size will falter as the Trump administration scales back agencies involved in the process.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the dead zone will be around 5,500 square miles this summer. Some estimates suggest it will be a little smaller, including those from LSU research scientists Nancy Rabalais and R. Eugene Turner. Their study predicts the hypoxic zone to be around 4,800 square miles, taking into account how warmer water temperatures have altered the Gulf’s complex food web, helping reduce the dead zone.
The different models share one key element: their predicted size is about three times  bigger than experts would like to see it.

A basin-wide problem
When nitrogen and phosphorus from farming fertilizers upriver washes down to the Gulf, the excess nutrients can cause algae to bloom near the surface of the water. When the algae dies and decomposes, it sinks into the water and depletes the oxygen fish and other aquatic life need to survive.
The hypoxic conditions affect commercial and recreational fishing as well as cause ecological harm. 
Efforts to reduce nutrient runoff into the Gulf are largely outlined in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Hypoxia Task Force Action Plan. Long-term, its goal is to reduce the dead zone to about 1,900 square miles by 2035. Its short-term objective is to drop the amount nitrogen and phosphorus emptying into the Gulf by 20%. 
Data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an integral agency in predicting the annual size of the dead zone, found the river’s phosphorus load was up 31% but its nitrate levels were about 24% below average in May. 
That’s just a snapshot from a single month, said Doug Daigle, an LSU coastal research scientist and coordinator for the Louisiana Hypoxia Working Group, a state-based organization working to address the Gulf’s dead zone. He emphasized that multi-year data will give the most accurate picture into whether the U.S. is on target to meet its goals. 
“Obviously, you don’t like it to be bigger in the years when it’s bigger, but then we also need to keep it in perspective in years when it’s smaller. It’s the trend over time that we’re looking at,” he said. “And we’re not at square one.”
Uncertainty ahead
Whether key federal agencies such as the USGS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will have sufficient funding and manpower to gauge if reduction goals are even being met is uncertain, Daigle said. 
“There’s a lot of question marks about what’s happening to the federal agencies and their capacity … between the mass firings and all the other things that are happening,” he said. 
Large sections of NOAA staff have been reduced, and USGS research and data collection funding faces millions of dollars in cutbacks. 
Daigle added there’s supposed to be a meeting of the EPA’s Hypoxia Task Force later this year, but with all of the federal changes, its members might not have the bandwidth to assess whether reduction goals are being met. 
“That’s all tentative at this point,” he said. 
An EPA spokesperson said in an email that the agency “takes this initiative very seriously” and will continue its progress. They did not respond to specific questions over staffing capacity and funding resources. 
NOAA’s communications staff declined to comment on staffing capacity, saying it “remains dedicated to providing timely information, research and resources.” 
Several federal task force positions remain vacant as of June 12, with only “TBD” listed on the EPA’s website for spots reserved for its own representatives, the Geological Survey,  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies. 
NOAA predicts the size of the dead zone at the beginning of the summer using an aggregate of models from various partner universities, including LSU and the University of Michigan. The agency will monitor and survey the dead zone throughout the summer and review its estimates against the size of the actual dead zone in August.
“It’s about human behavior. There’s both a watershed issue and a global climate change issue here,” Turner said. 
Turner and Rabalais agreed the problem isn’t with the EPA’s plan but a need for greater efforts to reduce nitrogen runoff upstream. Solutions such as cover crops and crop rotation strategies help farmers keep fertilizer in their soil for better plant growth and reduce hypoxia-causing runoff.
“Every place is going to be a little different, but there are ways to reduce this,” Turner said.  
Whether funding will continue to support these programs is unknown. Aside from some Inflation Reduction Act money and funds from previous federal farm bills, financial support for nutrient reduction has been “modest,” Daigle said. 
“There’s a lot of questions about what’s going to happen,” he added.
This upstream uncertainty affects industries that depend on the Gulf, such as commercial seafood harvesting, according to Daigle. 
“They’re under a lot of stress” from hurricanes and the influx of cheap, foreign shrimp saturating the market, he said. Reducing the hypoxic zone before it becomes the final nail in the coffin for shrimping in the Gulf is part of the Task Force’s plan, and now is the time to drive home these reduction strategies, Daigle said 
“The idea was that you wouldn’t wait for that to happen. You start reducing the loading, you reverse the trend,” he said.

Alex Padilla,Jeanne Kuang and Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/alex-padilla-handcuffed/,Alex Padilla is the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. FBI agents handcuffed him after he interrupted a press conference on immigration enforcement in LA.,"In summary
Alex Padilla is the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. FBI agents handcuffed him after he interrupted a press conference on immigration enforcement in LA.


Federal agents forcibly removed U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla from a Homeland Security press conference in Los Angeles on Thursday, pushing him to the ground and handcuffing him in a skirmish widely condemned by California Democrats. 
Padilla had walked into a press conference in which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was defending her agency’s crackdown on illegal immigration in LA, where workplace raids starting last Friday spurred widespread protests, confrontations between activists and agents and President Donald Trump’s extraordinary deployment of the National Guard. 
In videos of the incident shared on social media, Padilla identifies himself in front of an array of news cameras and says he has “questions for the secretary” as two men, apparently with the Secret Service, push him away from Noem’s lectern and toward the door. 
He seemed to be challenging Noem’s assertion that immigration agents had focused on arresting “violent criminals” when guards pushed him into the hallway. Three armed men, two of them in FBI uniforms, forced Padilla onto the ground and handcuffed him behind his back. Another tells the person recording the video, who identifies himself as a Padilla staffer, to stop recording.
California Democrats immediately slammed the response.
“Senator Alex Padilla is one of the most decent people I know,” Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on social media. “This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control. This must end now.”
The Trump administration in recent weeks has ramped up not only immigration raids but also its hardline response to critics. 
In LA, federal prosecutors charged well-known union leader David Huerta with conspiracy to impede a federal officer for his role in a protest outside a downtown garment warehouse last Friday where immigration agents were serving a search warrant and arresting immigrant workers. In New Jersey, they have charged Democratic U.S. Rep. Monica McIver with assault over a physical altercation that occurred when members of Congress visited an immigration detention center in Newark.
Gov. Newsom appointed Padilla to the Senate in 2020, filling the seat left by former Vice President Kamala Harris. He came up in politics through the Los Angeles City Council, and is the first Latino to represent California in the Senate. 
After agents released Padilla, he met briefly with Noem. Speaking with reporters afterward, Padilla said he had a briefing scheduled in the federal building and went to the press conference because lawmakers have gotten “little to no information” when making inquiries about the department’s “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions.”
“If this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, I can only imagine what they’re doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers throughout the Los Angeles community,” he said.
Homeland Security officials wrote on the department’s X account that Padilla’s interruption was “disrespectful political theatre” and that Secret Service agents thought he was an attacker. 
On Fox News, Noem said Padilla had not identified himself until he was “lunging forward.”
“Perhaps he wanted the scene,” she said.
Republicans, too, lept to defend their own. 
“If I busted into a press conference with the Governor or Sen. Padilla, I promise you, the same exact thing would happen to me,” Assemblymember Joe Patterson, a Rocklin Republican, wrote on social media.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061225_Alex-Padilla_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Gov. Ned Lamont has signed into law an overhaul of Connecticut’s century-old towing statutes that came after an investigation by the Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica exposed lax standards and predatory practices that victimized people who live paycheck to paycheck.
The bill was one of 28 that Lamont signed before departing for a vacation to Europe, followed by attendance Sunday through Tuesday at the Paris Air Show as part of a delegation of Connecticut aerospace manufacturers. Lamont now has signed 64 of the bills passed in the session that ended June 4.
Public Act 25-55 offers new protections against tows without warning from private property. In some cases, vehicle owners who could not afford to pay the fees to recover their vehicles lost them permanently. CT Mirror reporters found cases where companies required them to pay in cash or wouldn’t allow them to retrieve personal belongings.
[Gone in 15 days: How the Connecticut DMV allows tow companies to sell people’s cars]
State law allows tow companies to begin the process of selling a towed vehicle with a value of $1,500 of less after 15 days, too quick to challenge the legitimacy of a tow. 
It is the shortest window in all but two states, Iowa and North Carolina, and a far different standard than neighboring states. Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York require at least 60 days before a towed car can be sold for non-payment of towing and storage charges.
The new law still allows the sales process to begin after 15 days for a car worth $1,500 or less, but it extends the minimum time that garage owners must hold a vehicle before selling it to 30 or 60 days, depending on a vehicle’s value. 
It also requires, among other things, tow companies to accept credit and debit cards  for payment and provide access to the contents of a towed vehicle or allow an owner to recover it within four hours.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_0806_SR_MyHoopty_012_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Sterlingrb and UpAhead Design, via Wikimedia  Commons The Louisiana Legislature has created a new award level for the state’s popular tuition assistance program that will cover the entirety of tuition and fees at public universities for the highest-performing students. 
House Bill 77 by Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston, creates the TOPS Excellence award, which is available to any student with a 3.5 grade point average and a score of 31 or higher on the ACT or an equivalent score on a similar exam. The scholarship will provide tuition and fees at the Louisiana public university the student chooses or $12,000, whichever is less. 
“It’s a big win,” Turner said. 
Originally, Turner’s bill would have created a flat rate for each level of TOPS award rather than a unique allotment for each school. The new rate would have meant students at LSU, its two medical schools and the University of New Orleans would have paid more out of pocket, while students at other Louisiana schools would have paid less. 
The provisions drew the criticism of Phyllis Taylor, whose late husband Patrick F. Taylor was responsible for the creation of the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, a merit-based scholarship program for Louisiana students who attend in-state public colleges and universities. 
The original proposal was scaled back because it substantially increased the cost of the program. 
Instituting just the new TOPS Excellence award level will increase state spending $3 million in the first year, assuming 844 qualified students. The cost will increase over the next four years to a total cost of $12 million, when approximately 3,300 students are predicted to receive the award annually. 
Turner’s bill also allows students to qualify for any TOPS award level by taking the conservative-backed Classical Learning Test, which evaluates students on math, writing and grammar with an emphasis on classic literature and historic documents. Its supporters frequently tout that the exam emphasizes texts that “shaped Western culture.” 
The Classical Learning Test has been embraced by conservative lawmakers in Oklahoma, Florida and Arkansas. and has the support of the conservative Cato Institute and Heritage Foundation. 
Oklahoma lawmakers extensively debated embracing the Classical Learning Test to qualify for their version of TOPS, with Democrats arguing it doesn’t meet the same academic rigor and anti-cheating measures as the ACT. 
In Louisiana, only Louisiana Christian University accepts the Classical Learning Test for admissions, according to the CLT exam website.
Turner’s bill will go into effect unless Gov. Jeff Landry vetoes it.

Charley Thomson chats with attendees at a rally against CO2 pipelines at the Iowa Capitol March 18, 2025. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The issue of eminent domain as it pertains to a carbon sequestration pipeline project in Iowa has put Republicans at odds with one another, but Gov. Kim Reynolds’ Wednesday decision to veto a bill on the issue has amplified the tensions. 
On a call with landowners opposed to the pipeline project and upset by the veto, Rep. Steven Holt, a Republican from Denison and one of the lawmakers leading eminent domain and pipeline-related legislation, said there will be “consequences for the governor’s agenda” moving forward. 
“The governor’s lack of leadership is why we are where we are today, and it will affect her agenda going forward until the end of her term,” Holt said.

Landowners on the call were similarly upset by Reynolds’ decision, following years of silence on the issue. Peg Rasmussen, who owns land in Montgomery County, said “a true leader steps in when a problem arises” but “Reynolds did nothing.” 
“The legacy you leave behind is one of bowing down to big business at the expense of Iowans,” Rasmussen said. 


Background: 
Tensions around eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines have risen in response to proposed projects in Iowa.
Three projects, Navigator CO2, Wolf Carbon Solutions and Summit Carbon Solutions have sought to build carbon sequestration pipelines through Iowa.
The first two projects were withdrawn, but the Summit project received a permit from the Iowa Utilities Commission in June 2024 and has more than 1,300 voluntary easements signed for the project.
Landowners opposed to the pipelines have lobbied for four years against the projects, and in particular their ability to use eminent domain. This year lawmakers narrowly passed House File 639 to change the definition of a common carrier for hazardous liquid pipelines, increase insurance requirements, set permit limits and add requirements to the IUC.
Opponents of the bill said it changed the rules in the middle of the game, had unintended consequences to critical energy infrastructure and would stop Iowa from leading the nation in biofuels production.


Landowners also directed their animosity toward Republican lawmakers who opposed the bill, namely at senators who failed to take up the issue for four years, then argued House File 639 was a bad bill. 
“The fight for private property rights will continue,” Rasmussen, who was part of a group of landowners regularly lobbying at the State Capitol, said. “Iowa legislators and Gov. Reynolds, we’ll see you at the Capitol in 2026, and we can’t wait to tell our legislators how we feel about their votes in the 2026 election.” 
Holt said the “leadership void” from the governor and “civil war” among Senate Republicans has exposed the difference between “country club Republicans” and “grassroots Republicans.”
Rep. Charley Thomson, a Republican from Charles City who wrote the now-vetoed HF 639, and who, with Holt, has led much of the legislation on the issue, said the opposing Republicans are part of the “anything-for-a-buck ‘wing’ of the party” and don’t represent the “vast majority” of Iowa Republicans.
“In the governor’s view, constitutional rights, such as eminent domain protections, should not be allowed to interfere with schemes to make money, especially if those schemes are being promoted by her friends, supporters, and contributors,” Thomson wrote in a statement. 
Bruce Rastetter, founder of Summit Agricultural Group, which started Summit Carbon Solutions, has been a top campaign contributor to Reynolds’ campaigns, sparking some of the criticism leveled at the governor.
In her explanation of the veto decision, Reynolds wrote the bill had “vague legal standards” and would impact projects beyond just the use of eminent domain. Reynolds cited the permit limits clause in the bill and increased requirements for insurance as setting a precedent that “threatens” the state’s business reputation.
Senate President Amy Sinclair expressed the same beliefs on the bill. In a recent appearance on Iowa Press, Sinclair said HF 639 “was not a property owners rights bill” but rather a bill “that’s just going to facilitate activists.”
“To say I was a person who opposed property rights, that’s 100% false,” Sinclair said on the show.
Sinclair and other Republicans who were opposed to HF 639 voted for a re-write amendment to the bill, sponsored by Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, that would have allowed companies to avoid eminent domain and instead pursue voluntary easements outside of the project corridor. It also would have held operators responsible for damage to the land for the project’s lifetime.
Thomson said Reynolds’ stated concerns were a “polite window-dressing” for the governor’s “real message” that she will “veto any bill that Summit Carbon Solutions dislikes.”
In reaction to the veto, Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, vowed during a Radio Iowa interview to “work to kill every single piece of legislation that has (Reynolds’) name on it.”
The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the attacks from lawmakers. 
Summit Carbon Solutions, in a statement following the veto, said it looks forward to “continued discussions with state leaders” as the project advances.
Thomson and Holt said they are supportive of House Speaker Pat Grassley’s call to petition for a special session in order to override the veto of the bill.
The motion for a special session, and to override the veto, would require support from both chambers, which Senate majority leadership indicated Wednesday would be unlikely.
Corey Cerwinske, a Bremer County supervisor attending the virtual press conference, said lawmakers should introduce articles of impeachment on the governor for her “malfeasance.” 
Holt said while the veto “may violate” the constitutional rights of Iowans, the governor’s action “probably doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment.”
IUC announces plans for ‘increased commissioner engagement’
In her veto explanation, Reynolds asked the Iowa Utilities Commission to implement a section of the bill that required attendance at informational meetings and during live testimony. 
This was a problem brought up by landowners and lawmakers during the proceedings for the Summit Carbon Solutions permit. They alleged IUC would send representatives to meetings rather than commissioners, and that all three commissioners were not present during live testimony.
The IUC in a Thursday press release said it “fully supports” the “transparency goals” the governor requested and “will begin implementing” the practices. The release said the commission will also reinstate its public, monthly commission meetings beginning in August. 
“The IUC remains dedicated to fair, transparent, and accountable governance of Iowa’s energy and utility infrastructure,” the statement read.

Geri Peterson can tell you about the citizen discontent behind Saturday’s “No Kings” rally in Burlington, the largest of several dozen Vermont demonstrations — and 1,800 national events — set to protest the Trump administration.
As a lead organizer, she also knows about the unseen costs.
Peterson has learned the price of a permit to take over Burlington’s Waterfront Park from noon to 4 p.m. is $4,000. Renting a stage is another $4,000. Hiring a standby ambulance service is yet another $4,000. Add private security, traffic patrols, support personnel and portable restrooms and the final tab is expected to total about $20,000.
“It’s an enormous undertaking,” she said.
Peterson arranged a similar “Hands Off!” protest April 5 on the Statehouse lawn in Montpelier. Joining peers at 1,000 sister events nationwide, volunteers at the Vermont capital raised about $6,000 for a local street closure permit and security to handle an expected 6,000 people, only to see the crowd swell to an estimated 10,000.
Peterson hopes Saturday’s rally in Burlington will draw up to 20,000 people for speakers including U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., cartoonist Alison Bechdel and Columbia University protester Mohsen Mahdawi.

“Fingers crossed,” Peterson said of a potential appearance by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
The event is one of several dozen around the state and more than 1,800 across the nation set to counter a Washington, D.C., military parade on President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.
Vermont activists are building off a March 1 protest during Vice President JD Vance’s visit to the Sugarbush resort and several dozen April 5 “Hands Off!” resistance rallies statewide.
Organizers with the national 50501 and Indivisible networks said they hope their “No Kings” efforts will attract a total U.S. crowd larger than the estimated 3 to 5 million “Hands Off!” participants in April.
Vermont State Police and the Department of Public Safety don’t anticipate the protests will require them to increase their staffing or spending, according to spokesperson Adam Silverman. But Saturday’s demonstrations, set for communities as far north as Barton and as far south as Bennington, could squeeze the finances of at least one town.
Brattleboro organizers are planning for 1,000 people or more to gather on the town common from 3 to 6 p.m. The local government is charging $50 for the park rental and $25 for an event permit, although it won’t bill for police and public safety expenses anticipated to total up to $900 per hour.
“Our policy has been for the town to absorb the costs of these larger rallies,” Town Manager John Potter told the local selectboard at a meeting last week.
But hearing complaints about a 10.8% tax hike in the town budget, Brattleboro officials plan to ask protest organizers to voluntarily pay more until the municipality considers a higher fee structure.
“In recognition of what’s happening in the nation, there will be more events,” selectboard chair Elizabeth McLoughlin said.

By connecting the dots across the health care system, VITL is making it easier for providers to help patients stay up-to-date on immunizations — a win for individuals and for public health across the state. It’s one more reason Vermont continues to rank among the healthiest states in the country.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tracking immunizations so y[...]","Immunizations have long been one of Vermont’s most powerful public health tools, helping protect both individuals and communities from serious illness. But keeping track of your vaccine status can feel surprisingly complicated.
Who hasn’t had that moment in urgent care, staring blankly when asked, “When was your last tetanus shot?” And if you’re managing not just your own vaccines, but also those of your kids or aging parents, the challenges only multiply.
Health care providers have long relied on a powerful tool for accessing the most complete immunization histories possible for their patients: the Vermont Department of Health’s Vermont Immunization Registry, a secure, centralized system containing Vermonters’ immunization records. Now, that data is even more efficiently accessible to busy primary care providers and practice staff through a partnership between VITL (Vermont’s nonprofit health data sharing network), the Vermont Department of Health, and practices and hospitals around the state.    
VITL offers a new service to primary care practices and other health care provider offices, directly connecting their electronic health records to the Vermont Immunization Registry, so they can query for data in an instant, without opening another program. 
In the past year, VITL delivered immunization data into providers’ electronic health records over half a million times. For patients, it happens behind the scenes, delivering their essential records to their health care providers when and where they need them.
Here are three things to know about how VITL is helping you stay on top of essential immunizations.
1) What is health information sharing?
At the heart of this effort is health information sharing — but what does that actually mean?
In short, it’s the secure electronic sharing of your medical information, like vaccine history, among your providers. VITL connects many Vermont practices and hospitals to each other and centralizes data to create one health record for each Vermonter. That record includes information like your name and date of birth, along with allergies, medications, lab results, and immunizations. 
Having one record from the many places you receive care enables your providers to access a more complete, up-to-date picture of your medical history and current treatments. The data is available to health care providers and staff, insurance providers for certain initiatives such as care coordination, and public health professionals like the staff at the Vermont Department of Health who lead initiatives to keep Vermonters healthy and well. 
2) Faster access to immunization records means better care
A real-world example of this system in action comes from Primary Care Health Partners (PCHP), one of Vermont’s largest independent medical groups.
In the past, PCHP staff often had to manually check state records or call pharmacies to get vaccine histories — a time-consuming process for already busy primary care staff. But now (thanks to the Immunization Registry Query & Response Service, as it is known to the medical community), things have gotten easier.
Now, with just a few clicks, PCHP providers and staff can instantly pull immunization records from the Vermont Immunization Registry right in their own electronic health record, freeing up valuable time for patient care. PCHP estimates their nurses save more than an hour and 20 minutes every day, thanks to the VITL service. This system also ensures that clinicians have the most current immunization data, which is critical for supporting each individual’s health and for protecting vulnerable populations and improving public health outcomes.
3) Updated immunization records help patients stay on schedule
One of the biggest advantages of this system is its ability to help keep immunization schedules on track.
The VITL service enables primary care clinicians and staff to pull immunization records from other providers’ offices — and from clinics and pharmacies — right into their patient’s record for a more comprehensive immunization history. Even better, the system can flag upcoming or overdue immunizations, helping patients and families stay ahead of their health needs even if they can’t track everything themselves.
“Immunizations are crucial for preventing the spread of infectious diseases,” says Amanda Jones, Informatics Director at the Vermont Department of Health. “The Vermont Immunization Registry gives health care providers easy access to individual vaccination records and forecasts future patient immunization needs — this technology is keeping people in Vermont up-to-date on vaccines and really protecting our communities.”
By connecting the dots across the health care system, VITL is making it easier for providers and patients alike to manage immunizations — a win not just for individuals, but also for public health across the state. It’s one more reason Vermont continues to rank among the healthiest states in the country.
If you want to learn more about how VITL shares your health data with health care providers, there is information on vitl.net/sharing. Every Vermonter has options, and you can explore them on the VITL website. The VITL team is also available to talk with you and answer questions about health information sharing Monday–Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., excluding holidays. VITL’s toll-free number is 1-888-980-1243.

MONTPELIER — Amid President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportations, the City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to form a committee that will develop a strategy for navigating U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity within Montpelier and improve how the city communicates residents’ rights.
The proposal was introduced by Councilor Pelin Kohn, who was born in Turkey and moved to the United States with her American husband in 2017. She became a citizen in 2020 and is a board member for the Central Vermont Refugee Action Network.“Sometimes, ICE-related things are like news for people. … But for people I know, support and work with, it is their reality, and they live in fear,” she said. “For me, as an immigrant American, it is a very, very real fear. I’ve been approached by different community members, different groups, and I thought maybe our city can just review all the policies we have.”Kohn’s proposal seeks to strengthen Montpelier’s already progressive immigration policy by having the ad hoc committee develop a community strategy for responding to “any ICE activity within city limits,” and improve “public communication, including the development of a dedicated, accessible city web page outlining resident rights, city policy, and emergency resources.”
Montpelier became Vermont’s third sanctuary city — a municipality that limits its cooperation with federal authorities to protect undocumented immigrants — in 2016. Since then, the city has adopted strategies like the “fair and impartial policing” policy, which sets strict guidelines for how Montpelier police can enforce immigration law, and restricts police cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Sanctuary cities have come under fire by Trump, who tried to pull federal and FEMA funding from sanctuary cities and recently listed them online. The administration later pulled this list down after it mislabeled multiple locations.Councilor Ben Doyle expressed concerns about potential backlash from the federal government to any further pro-immigrant moves by the city.
“I think the motive here is really good, it’s to keep our neighbors safe,” Doyle said. “[But] when I read the description of the purpose of the committee, I did get nervous about potential unintended consequences.” 
The creation of the committee follows a statewide push for institutions addressing immigration. Gov. Phil Scott recently signed a bill establishing a committee to study whether the state should create an Office of New Americans to support people who entered Vermont from outside the country, and another putting restrictions on state agencies and local governments from entering into agreements with federal immigration officials.

Alex Padilla at a Thursday press conference in Los Angeles by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem amid multi-day protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.The scuffle between law enforcement, including an officer wearing a jacket with an FBI logo, and a United States senator represented a stark escalation of tensions after President Donald Trump ordered 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to LA. His action followed major protests sparked by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials ramping up immigration raids.Before Padilla was physically removed, Noem said that the Trump administration would continue its immigration enforcement in LA.“We are not going away,” Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, said. “We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialists and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into the city.”Padilla, 52, a member of the Senate since 2021, when he was appointed to replace former Vice President Kamala Harris, and then elected in 2022, tried to ask Noem a question and was rushed by federal law enforcement.“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla and I have questions for the secretary,” he said as four federal law enforcement officers grabbed him and shoved him to the ground. “Hands off.”The DHS wrote on social media that U.S. Secret Service officers thought “he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately.”DHS said that after the press conference, Noem and Padilla had a 15-minute meeting. His office did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.In a statement, Padilla’s office said the California senator was in LA for congressional oversight into the federal government’s operations in LA and across California.“He was in the federal building to receive a briefing with General Guillot and was listening to Secretary Noem’s press conference,” his office said, referring to General Gregory M. Guillot, commander of United States Northern Command.“He tried to ask the Secretary a question, and was forcibly removed by federal agents, forced to the ground and handcuffed. He is not currently detained, and we are working to get additional information.”The incident drew swift condemnation from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.“Watching this video sickened my stomach, the manhandling of a United States Senator, Senator Padilla,” Schumer wrote on social media. “We need immediate answers to what the hell went on.”On the Senate floor, Schumer said the video of Padilla “reeks of totalitarianism.”He called for a full investigation so that “this doesn’t happen again.”Padilla gave remarks after the incident, with The Associated Press. He did not take questions. “If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they're doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers out in the Los Angeles community,” Padilla said.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Mike Lee, R-Utah, participates in a forum hosted by the Sutherland Institute at the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics on Oct. 14, 2024. (Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)This story first appeared on Utah News Dispatch.
U.S. Sen. Mike Lee is bringing back a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Utah and other Western states.
Lee, a Utah Republican, says it will open up “underused” federal land for housing and help communities manage growth. Opponents, including a number of Democrats in Congress and environmental groups, say it’s an attempt to pay for tax cuts and warn it will jeopardize access to public lands.
Introduced Wednesday evening, Lee’s amendment to congressional Republicans’ budget bill, nicknamed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” renews an effort initially spearheaded by Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, and Mark Amodei, R-Nev., that sought to dispose of 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah and some 450,000 acres of federal land in Nevada.
But Lee’s proposal is much broader — rather than earmark specific parcels of land for disposal like Maloy and Amodei’s amendment, Lee wants to require the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture to sell off a percentage of land managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
According to the amendment, both agencies would be required to dispose of between 0.5% and 0.75% of land they manage, which amounts to about 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. State and local governments would be allowed to nominate parcels of land, and would be granted priority to purchase.
Eleven states would be eligible — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Notably, Montana is exempt, and Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke was instrumental in sinking Maloy and Amodei’s original proposal, stating that selling public lands is a line he would not cross.
Long-thwarted efforts to sell public lands see new life under Trump

Though the scope is much bigger, Lee’s reasoning behind the proposal is the same as Maloy and Amodei’s — identify parcels of federal land near high-growth areas, and sell them at market value to local governments to use for housing, water infrastructure, roads and other development.
The amendment prohibits the sale of land that’s already designated, such as national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas or national recreation areas. Land that has an existing right — like a mining claim, grazing permit, mineral lease or right of way — is also off-limits.
If it passes, the secretaries of the departments of interior and agriculture would have to prioritize nominating land that’s next to already developed areas, has access to existing infrastructure or is “suitable for residential housing.” The amendment also directs the secretaries to nominate land that’s isolated and “inefficient to manage,” and to reduce the checkerboard land pattern, the result of railroad grants in the 1800s that left small plots of private land scattered within swaths of federal land and vice versa.
“We’re opening underused federal land to expand housing, support local development and get Washington, D.C., out of the way for communities that are just trying to grow,” Lee said in a video address. “We’re talking about isolated parcels that are difficult to manage, that are better suited for housing and infrastructure. To our hunters, anglers and sportsmen, you will not lose access to the lands you love. Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands.”
But that reasoning didn’t fly with a number of environmental groups, including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, which called Lee’s proposal an attempt “to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”
“Senator Lee’s never-ending attacks on public lands continue. His hostility stands in stark contrast with Americans’ deep and abiding love of public lands. Senator Lee’s plan puts Utah’s redrock country in the crosshairs of unchecked development,” said Travis Hammill, Washington, D.C., director for the alliance. “In Utah and the West, public lands are the envy of the country — but Senator Lee is willing to sacrifice the places where people recreate, where they hunt and fish, and where they make a living.”
The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, called Lee’s amendment “a shameless ploy to sell off pristine public lands for trophy homes and gated communities that will do nothing to address the affordable housing shortage in the West.” The National Wildlife Federation dubbed it a “fire sale” that is “orders of magnitude worse” than Maloy’s proposal. The Wilderness Society said it was “a betrayal of future generations and folks on both sides of the aisle” and warned that could spark political backlash.
Maloy’s proposal identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George in Utah. The land would have been used for water infrastructure (such as reservoirs and wells), an airport expansion in St. George, new and widened roads, recreation and housing.
The proposal was widely celebrated by the water district and local governments, who said it would help them make adjustments as the region continues to experience rapid growth. But nearby tribes, environmentalists and politicians from both sides of the aisle were skeptical.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is urging insurers to continue covering vaccinations during pregnancy in an open letter signed by 30 prominent professional health organizations.
Pregnant patients and their infants are vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. In the letter to payers and insurance companies released this week, ACOG stressed the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations and how they protect babies and pregnant people. It was signed by prominent professional groups including the American College of Physicians, Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Public Health Association.
The letter follows U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy children and healthy pregnant patients, sidestepping an established decision process by scientists. Kennedy, who has made false claims questioning vaccine safety, earlier this week fired all 17 experts on the federal vaccine advisory committee panel, replacing them with eight new members, four of whom have spoken out against vaccines.
The Trump administration’s moves have alarmed health experts, who worry about coverage and access to the shot amid the agency’s dismissal of science.
“We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” the letter reads. “Given the historic gaps in research, investment, and support for women’s health, it is essential that all aspects of obstetric and gynecologic care — including COVID-19 vaccination — be grounded in the best available scientific evidence.
Studies have shown babies born following a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have a higher risk of low birth weights, stillbirth and respiratory distress, and data demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
Pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are also at higher risk of complications such as blood clots, are more likely to be hospitalized in intensive care units or to need ventilators, and are at a higher risk of death, the letter notes.
Payers should make the vaccine available to “pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” the letter reads. Without insurance, a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 shot can cost roughly $140 for adults.
Following the recommendation rollback, public health officials in some states have emphasized their support of COVID-19 vaccines.
The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, for example, said it “continues to recommend the current COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older,” noting that newborns “depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection.”
Wisconsin Medicaid will also continue to cover the shot, the department said in a media release.
Officials in Georgia also said they expect continued coverage of the shot.
In Washington, a spokesperson for the state health agency told local media that the department is advising pregnant people to speak with their provider “to determine if receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is best for them.”
During this year’s legislative sessions, at least seven states introduced legislation aiming to ban or limit mRNA vaccines. Instead of using a weakened or dead version of the actual virus to stimulate an immune response, mRNA vaccines use a genetic code created in a laboratory to tell the body’s cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology.
“The COVID vaccines were a remarkable scientific accomplishment, and they remain the best tool that we have to prevent severe outcomes associated with COVID infection,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, ACOG president, wrote in a statement. “Ob-gyns know that COVID infection during pregnancy can be incredibly dangerous for our pregnant patients — and we know that the vaccine can protect both them and their infants after birth.”
When patients are “forced to pay out of pocket, or to cover high cost sharing,” he wrote, “they are less likely to be able to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”

John James’s burgeoning gubernatorial campaign met an unexpected – albeit lighthearted – roadblock on Thursday: President Donald Trump.
In a news conference, Trump spoke to the press and a crowd of U.S. lawmakers before signing a bill that James (R-Shelby Township) sponsored to “stop California’s radical electric vehicle mandate and protect American auto jobs,” as James described on X.

During a string of thank yous to lawmakers who put forward the bill, Trump ribbed James over his campaign to seek the Michigan Republican Party nomination for governor in 2026. Trump joked that the party wouldn’t let him run for governor if he didn’t have a suitable replacement in Congress.
In response, James spokesperson Hannah Osantowske told Michigan Advance that James was “flattered by the president’s acknowledgment … that his departure from the House will be a loss for Congress.”
“While Washington may see John’s departure as a loss, it will certainly be Michigan’s gain,” Osantowske said.

A list of “sanctuary” jurisdictions accused of failing to cooperate with immigration arrests, including the state of Colorado, was taken down after protests about its accuracy. (Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A list of 14 states, 298 counties and 200 cities deemed immigration sanctuaries by the Trump administration has disappeared from a government website but continues to hang over the heads of officials who face threats of losing federal funding.
“We were placed on a list with many other sheriffs across the nation for no clear reason and no clear cause,” said Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County, North Carolina, a heavily Democratic county that nevertheless complies with a new state law requiring cooperation with immigration arrests.
“The list is gone. Am I satisfied that it was rectified? Yes. Am I satisfied that it’s over? No,” Blackwood said.
The list went up May 29. It called out the “cities, counties, and states that are deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.” The White House had already threatened “suspension or termination” of federal funds to them.
Along with counties and cities, the list named the whole states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia as “state sanctuary” areas.
There was immediate reaction from some areas, not only Democratic states and counties with court-tested legal policies of declining cooperation with deportation, but also conservative areas mystified by their inclusion.
“We figure it must be some kind of mix-up. We certainly support our fellow law enforcement agencies,” said James Davel, administrative coordinator for Shawano County, Wisconsin, which was included despite no apparent immigration sanctuary policy. The county voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 by more than 67%.
One possible explanation: The county board passed a resolution in 2021 declaring Shawano a “Second Amendment Sanctuary County” as a sign of “vigorous support of the peoples’ Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.”
The list disappeared from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website in a matter of days, after the National Sheriffs’ Association complained that many counties were erroneously included.
“It was quite the debacle,” said sheriffs’ association spokesperson Patrick Royal. “We are working with the administration to resolve as much as we can.”
But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a television appearance that the list would come back and was largely accurate.
“That list is absolutely continuing to be used and it is going to be identifying those cities and those jurisdictions that aren’t honoring law and justice,” Noem said in a Fox News interview June 1.
Courts have so far upheld local laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration arrests. California won a lawsuit on the issue in 2017 under the first Trump administration, and the same federal judge issued an injunction saying federal funds couldn’t be withheld on the basis of immigration cooperation during a new trial on the issue.
The national sheriffs’ association president, Sheriff Kieran Donahue of Canyon County, Idaho, said in a May 31 statement that the list “was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation.” He said it was “an unfortunate and unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement.” Canyon County was not on the list, though the city of Boise was.
The pushback from sheriffs was a sign of how seriously flawed the list was, said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
“The real problem is, how are they defining sanctuary?” Putzel-Kavanaugh said. “To have pushback from an association that is typically quite supportive of this administration and their agenda points to problems with definition.”
Watauga County, North Carolina, was on the list when it first appeared May 29 but came off before it was taken down. The county’s congressional representative, Republican Virginia Foxx, said in a Facebook post that she intervened.
In the post, Foxx called it “a mistake … made during the Biden administration that resulted in Watauga County being listed incorrectly as a sanctuary county.” She also said that “Watauga County is no longer listed” after she “contacted DHS.”
Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group favoring less immigration, said her list of sanctuary jurisdictions included Watauga based on a June 2024 report from U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement listing it as among hundreds of others as “non-cooperative institutions.”
Vaughan said data she requested from ICE shows some counties in North Carolina were still not complying with all detainers this year through early February, but Watauga is not one of them
“They should probably come off the list,” she said. “None of those sheriffs has contacted me about reviewing their policies or taking them off the map. I would be happy to do so, and have done so frequently with sheriffs in other states.”
Sheriff Len Hagaman of Watauga County told Stateline via email that he had contacted federal immigration officials and confirmed that his county, which voted Democratic for president last year by a 52% to 46% margin, had a solid record of cooperating with immigration arrests.
Hagaman alluded to an April Facebook post by U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, calling out Watauga and eight other North Carolina counties as immigration sanctuaries.
“For several weeks now, I, along with other North Carolina sheriffs have had to endure gross and inaccurate misinformation regarding false allegations,” Hagaman wrote.

(Courtesy of the City of Las Cruces / Kelsey Hiss)Las Cruces is moving forward with a project to cool the city’s hottest homes, but on a much smaller scale, city officials said, after the federal government pulled funds with little official communication.
“I don’t want to say canceled because formally no one has told us that,” said City of Las Cruces Sustainability Officer Jenney Hernandez. “But no one has also told us or talked to us since announcing that they have been — so to speak — on pause.”
Since 2022, the city was committed for $1.5 million in state and U.S. Department of Energy grants to install the heat pumps with a plan to outfit between 130 to 150 homes in two years.
Between funding received from the New Mexico Legislature and some leftover federal funds and vouchers, the program has about $700,000, Hernandez said, nearly half of what the city had secured initially.
“Now that all of this happened, it just means we have to reduce the initial amounts of home we anticipated to serve,” Hernandez said. “Quite honestly, we’re limping a lot at this point.”
The cooling program is only becoming more urgent as increasing heat threatens Las Cruces residents’ health.
“It’s a life threat for people experiencing high temperatures in their homes, with no other options for cooling,” she said.
In 2020, Las Cruces mapped the urban heat island effect by measuring the heat-trapping power of concrete and asphalt and the cooling impact of shaded green spaces. Las Cruces found the effect made low-income neighborhoods as much as 14 degrees hotter than higher-income neighborhoods, making it feel like 112 degrees when the air temperature measured 107 degrees.
These neighborhoods include some of the city’s oldest homes with many low-income families or seniors.
“You have a very sensitive population residing in these homes that have to deal with almost three months straight of triple-degree weather,” Hernandez said. “If you’re lucky, a swamp cooler in triple-degree weather and humidity will cool your house to about 90 degrees, which, after several consecutive days, is really detrimental to your health.”
Based on those findings, the city developed a plan to bring cooling into low-income neighborhoods by installing all-electric heat pumps. Despite the name, the heat pump also offers efficient cooling of outside or underground air. Heat pumps work in more conditions than swamp coolers and may be cheaper than air conditioning over time, Hernandez said, noting incentives for such pumps through both the federal Inflation Reduction Act and state programs.
In January, when about to sign one grant contract for $400,000, the city received an email from the grant contractors that said “The DOE team has asked us to reschedule all sessions for the rest of the month,” and which canceled all meetings booked into April.
A second DOE grant, which Las Cruces first won in 2022, and was anticipating securing another $400,000 from in March, was “postponed,” according to an email from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Hernandez said federal agencies have told the city the funding is under review, but has no answers for a timeline or if funding opportunities will be restored.
“Our office of Sustainability has — I don’t want to say lost — but is being ghosted on the money that has been awarded,” Hernandez said.
Source NM emailed requests for comment on Wednesday to the U.S. Department of Energy, but had not received a response by publication time.
The city is committing to selecting 30 pilot homes in the first year, and anticipates adding another 40 in the second year, much smaller than the initial scope. Hernandez said she’s seeking additional funding from outside grant sources, but doesn’t know if the program can continue beyond the first two years.
“I don’t know if there will be a third and fourth year,” she said. “And if there is, the amounts the residents will have to pay out of pocket will be much more substantial than we ever wanted, because we don’t have the money to help any more.”

Utah Sen. Mike Lee is bringing back a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Utah and other Western states.
Lee says it will open up “underused” federal land for housing and help communities manage growth — opponents, including a number of Democrats in Congress and environmental groups, say it’s an attempt to pay for tax cuts and warn it will jeopardize access to public lands.
Introduced Wednesday evening, Lee’s amendment to congressional Republicans’ budget bill, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill,” renews an effort initially spearheaded by Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, and Mark Amodei, R-Nevada, that sought to dispose of 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah and some 450,000 acres of federal land in Nevada.
But Lee’s proposal is much broader — rather than earmark specific parcels of land for disposal like Maloy and Amodei’s amendment, Lee wants to require the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture to sell off a percentage of land managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
According to the amendment, both agencies would be required to dispose of between 0.5% to 0.75% of land they manage, which amounts to about 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. State and local governments would be allowed to nominate parcels of land, and would be granted priority to purchase.

Eleven states would be eligible — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Notably, Montana is exempt, and Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke was instrumental in sinking Maloy and Amodei’s original proposal, stating that selling public lands is a line he would not cross.
Though the scope is much bigger, Lee’s reasoning behind the proposal is the same as Maloy and Amodei’s — identify parcels of federal land near high-growth areas, and sell them at market value to local governments to use for housing, water infrastructure, roads and other development.
The amendment prohibits the sale of land that’s already designated, like national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas or national recreation areas. Land that has an existing right, like a mining claim, grazing permit, mineral lease or right of way is also off limits.
If it passes, the secretaries of the departments of interior and agriculture would have to prioritize nominating land that’s next to already developed areas, has access to existing infrastructure or is “suitable for residential housing.” The amendment also directs the secretaries to nominate land that’s isolated and “inefficient to manage,” and to reduce the checkerboard land pattern, the result of railroad grants in the 1800s that left small plots of private land scattered within swaths of federal land and vice-versa.
“We’re opening underused federal land to expand housing, support local development and get Washington, D.C. out of the way for communities that are just trying to grow,” Lee said in a video address. “We’re talking about isolated parcels that are difficult to manage, that are better suited for housing and infrastructure. To our hunters, anglers and sportsmen, you will not lose access to the lands you love. Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands.”
Officials eye airport expansion, reservoirs and new roads under Maloy’s proposed public land sale

But that reasoning didn’t fly for a number of environmental groups, including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, which called Lee’s proposal an attempt “to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”
“Senator Lee’s never-ending attacks on public lands continue. His hostility stands in stark contrast with Americans’ deep and abiding love of public lands. Senator Lee’s plan puts Utah’s redrock country in the crosshairs of unchecked development,” said Travis Hammill, Washington, D.C. director for the alliance. “In Utah and the West, public lands are the envy of the country — but Senator Lee is willing to sacrifice the places where people recreate, where they hunt and fish, and where they make a living.”
The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, called Lee’s amendment “a shameless ploy to sell off pristine public lands for trophy homes and gated communities that will do nothing to address the affordable housing shortage in the West”; the National Wildlife Federation dubbed it a “fire sale” that is “orders of magnitude worse” than Maloy’s proposal; The Wilderness Society said it was “a betrayal of future generations and folks on both sides of the aisle” and warned that could spark political backlash.
Maloy’s proposal identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George. The land would have been used for water infrastructure (like reservoirs and wells), an airport expansion in St. George, new and widened roads, recreation and housing.
The proposal was widely celebrated by the water district and local governments, who said it would help them make adjustments as the region continues to experience rapid growth. But nearby tribes, environmentalists and politicians from both sides of the aisle were skeptical.

In her latest court filings, Bird has criticized Marx, alleging the sheriff has, in essence, asserted that “federal immigration officials should not be trusted.”
Bird has also signaled that even if Marx were to comply with her demand that he disavow his past statements, the state is still obligated to strip Winneshiek County of funding, at least temporarily, based on those previous statements.

The lawsuit, filed in March in Polk County District Court, claims that Iowa law “requires stripping Winneshiek County of state funding until the sheriff follows the procedure to reinstate the funds” by disavowing his previous public statements on immigration enforcement.
The lawsuit stems from a Feb. 4, 2025, Facebook post in which, Marx, a Republican, stated that if his office received “detainer” requests to hold immigrants suspected of lacking legal status, and those requests were not vetted and approved by the courts, they would be rejected by his office.

In his post, Marx distinguished between detainer requests of that kind and what he called “valid” judicial warrants and court orders. He wrote that “the only reason detainers are issued is because the federal agency does not have enough information or has not taken the time to obtain a valid judicial warrant.”
In recent court filings, Bird claims that assertion by Marx is false, but that even if it were true, that’s not a defense since Iowa Code Chapter 27A clearly prohibits Iowa law enforcement officers from discouraging cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
“The court need not go down this rabbit hole,” Bird said, referring to the accuracy of Marx’s statements, adding that Chapter 27A “does not turn on whether the discouragement to cooperate with federal law is true or false… Whether Marx’s post was ‘an opinion’ or a statement of fact is irrelevant to whether he intentionally discouraged enforcement of immigration law.”
Bird: State funds for Winneshiek County must be denied
Before filing the lawsuit, Bird provided Marx with specific language to include in a public statement disavowing his Facebook post, written in the first-person to appear over Marx’s signature. Although Marx’s office deleted the Facebook post, Marx did not publish the statement authored by Bird, who then sued, seeking a court order declaring Winneshiek County to be ineligible to receive any state funds.
Bird is now contesting Marx’s request that the court dismiss the case.
“Marx’s removal of his Facebook post after the attorney general initiated this enforcement action does not moot the case,” Bird argues in a court filing. “Marx has not issued a public retraction of the statement, so his violation is ongoing … Just deleting the offending Facebook post was not, alone, enough to bring Marx back into compliance. Without more explanation of what was wrong with the post, the untrue allegations remain unrebutted and the discouragement caused by the initial post remains ongoing.”
Bird also argues that even if Marx were to fully comply now with her request to disavow his previous statements, Iowa law still requires the state to temporarily strip Winneshiek County of state funding.
The law, Bird has argued to the court, “requires a state-funds denial whenever Chapter 27A is violated — no matter whether the violation persists throughout the litigation … To find otherwise would allow local entities to avoid liability for violating the law by ceasing to violate the law as soon as an enforcement action begins.”
In her court filings, Bird also notes that “the Legislature clearly intended a local entity to face some punishment for a violation because it does not allow a petition for reinstatement (of funds) until ‘no earlier than ninety days after the date of a final judicial determination.’”
In response to the lawsuit, Marx and Winneshiek County have each asked to be removed from the case, prompting the attorney general to characterize the county’s request as “odd” given the amount of money that’s at stake.
“Though millions of dollars of its state funding is on the line, Winneshiek County makes the odd request to be removed from the case,” Bird stated in a June 6 court filing. “Given the financial consequences, the state assumed that the county would want to have a say in this litigation.”
As for Marx’s request that he be dismissed as a party to the case, Bird has told the court “the state does not hold strong views on the issue of which defendant best represents the county’s interest … If Marx wants to put Winneshiek County’s state funding at risk and then not defend his actions in court, so be it.”
A hearing date on all of the motions now before the court has yet to be scheduled. A status conference on the case is scheduled for Friday, June 13.

(Nicole Neri/The Minnesota Reformer)An effort to pass sweeping reforms to the laws governing homeowners’ associations and their property management companies largely failed in the Legislature this year, despite a chorus of complaints from homeowners about surprise bills and conflicts of interest. 
But lawmakers did approve the creation of a new Common Interest Communities Ombudsperson within the Department of Commerce, who will be charged with mediating disputes between homeowners and HOAs.
The ombudsperson, however, will have no authority to enforce agreements or offer legal advice. Their main responsibilities will be to create and disseminate plain-language explanations of common provisions in HOA documents; provide “informal” mediation services; and offer advice to lawmakers on issues affecting common interest communities. “Common interest communities” is the legal umbrella term for HOAs and condo associations. 
The creation of the ombudsperson’s office is one small win for the bipartisan group of lawmakers who sought to give homeowners more explicit rights and powers, while reining in property management companies and HOA boards.
The Reformer has reported on the stories of homeowners who were surprised with huge bills for repairs they didn’t think were necessary. At least one property management company also owns a construction firm, raising questions about conflicts of interest.
After the conclusion of the 2024 legislative session, a working group of lawmakers, homeowners, housing advocates and representatives of property managers gathered regularly to weigh how the state could empower homeowners in the face of rising complaints against unrestrained homeowners’ associations and property management companies.
The group came up with more than 150 recommendations, of which 41 made it into the final report to the Legislature. Many were incorporated into a bill that passed in the Senate, but not the House. 
That bill would have required HOA boards or property managers to solicit at least three written bids for all repair jobs valued at more than $50,000; blocked cities from requiring HOAs as a condition for approving a housing development; required HOAs to create and distribute a schedule of fines and fees; and to adopt a dispute resolution process.
None of those measures passed. 
The Minnesota chapter of the Community Associations Institute, which represents HOA boards and property managers across the state, backed the creation of the ombudsperson, but largely opposed other aspects of the HOA reform legislation. 
The organization got its members to show up on the Capitol in early April to rally against the more controversial aspects of the HOA reform package; many wore “I  my HOA” shirts. 
“[The ombudsperson] is a commonsense solution to the complaints that we all have heard about homeowners and boards not understanding their rights and obligations that exist under the current laws,” CAI lobbyist Phaedra Howard said. “It is our hope that lawmakers will give this solution a chance to work before trying to make additional unnecessary changes to the existing statutes that have worked and continue to work well for our state.”
Opponents of the larger reform package worried that the bill would require more man hours from the volunteers who staff HOA boards, or force homeowners to pay property management companies and attorneys to bring the association into compliance with the new rules. Some were also concerned that the scrutiny and additional work would disincentivize homeowners from joining their HOA board, many of which are already struggling to recruit volunteers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250402_0093-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

California and 10 other states immediately sued and the governor ordered the air board to craft a new mandate.,"In summary
Trump signed measures today revoking waivers for the state’s mandates that clean up car and truck exhaust and ramp up sales of electric vehicles. California and 10 other states immediately sued and the governor ordered the air board to craft a new mandate.


President Donald Trump this morning signed three measures that block California’s mandates to phase out gas-powered cars and clean up diesel trucks. And California immediately struck back with a lawsuit and a vow to continue setting standards.
The move by Trump and Congress deals a substantial blow to the state’s aggressive transition to electric vehicles and could upend its decades-long authority to clean up its air pollution, which is the worst in the nation.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate,” Trump said at the White House. “And they’re never coming back.” He said the state’s zero-emission car phaseout “has been a disaster for this country.”
Last month, Congress used the Congressional Review Act to revoke three waivers that the Biden administration granted to California to set standards phasing out gas-powered cars and diesel trucks. Trump’s signing makes that official. The dispute between California and the Trump administration and Congress highlights the growing political division over electric vehicles and air pollution policy.
Many legal experts, along with the Government Accountability Office and Senate Parliamentarian, said Congress has no authority to revoke the waivers.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed suit against Trump  and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, arguing that it’s an unlawful use of the review act.
“Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process. We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement today. 
Ten other states that are enforcing California’s emissions rules joined the lawsuit — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.
Newsom today also issued an executive order that reaffirms the state’s commitment to phasing out gas and diesel-powered vehicles. He directed the Air Resources Board to craft another mandate for cars and trucks — to either bolster its existing mandates or replace them in case they lose in court.
Newsom also directed the air board to create a public list of automakers and truck manufacturers that are following California’s emissions rules, and companies that take early action to convert fleets to zero-emission trucks “regardless of the status of those regulations under federal law.” And he ordered state agencies within 60 days to determine what more can be done to help consumers with the transition to electric vehicles, including eliminating obstacles to building more charging stations.
Because of its highly polluted air, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards in the 1967 Clean Air Act. Before now, the federal government has never blocked any of California’s dozens of rules.
Under California’s mandate enacted in 2022, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emissions, ramping up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. It builds on decades of tightening emissions standards for cars sold in the state.
Congress also blocked California’s 2020 Advanced Clean Trucks rule, an unprecedented measure that requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035. A third vote revoked the waiver for a 2020 state regulation reducing nitrogen oxides — a key ingredient of smog — emitted by trucks and buses..

Free.,Abrego Garcia lawyers want Trump administration fined for defying court orders,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abrego-garcia-lawyers-want-trump-administration-fined-defying-court-orders,,"WASHINGTON — The lawyers for wrongly deported Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia late Wednesday requested civil fines be levied against Trump administration officials for repeatedly ignoring court orders — including from the U.S. Supreme Court — to bring their client back from El Salvador to the United States.In the filing, the attorneys asked Maryland District Judge Paula Xinis to impose court sanctions on the government for evading discovery requests that attempted to determine steps taken to return Abrego Garcia. The Trump administration has admitted his deportation to a notorious mega-prison in March was an “administrative error.”“For nine weeks, the Government defied this Court’s order, affirmed by a unanimous Supreme Court, to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States following his illegal removal to El Salvador,” according to the filing.In addition to fines on the government for failing to comply with court orders, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers suggest “Courts may impose monetary sanctions against government attorneys personally” and “The court may go even further and prohibit the government from reimbursing its attorneys for their costs.”And they note the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals “has affirmed civil contempt sanctions for parties that have evinced ‘disregard for the discovery process,’ such as by failing to produce discovery materials pursuant to a court order, that mirrors the conduct of the Government in the instant case.”Timing for Tennessee indictment questionedAbrego Garcia was brought back to the United States on June 6, but to face a criminal indictment on the accusation he took part in human smuggling of people in the country without legal authorization. He is currently detained and will face an arraignment before a Nashville judge Friday.His attorneys questioned the timing of the indictment, noting that while Attorney General Pam Bondi “declined, when asked by reporters, to state when the criminal investigation began, public reporting indicates that it started in April—around the same time that this Court ordered expedited discovery into the Government’s apparent defiance of Court orders.”“While the Government was telling this Court one thing and the world something else, it was secretly working to charge Abrego Garcia with two felony immigration charges based on alleged conduct that occurred years ago—and that it previously trumpeted in the media as justifying his removal,” according to the filing.The attorneys specifically cite possible sanctions against Department of Homeland Security attorney Joseph N. Mazzara, based on a New York Times story where Mazzara allegedly said the Trump administration was trying to keep Abrego Garcia in El Salvador.“Divining the identities of these officials is made difficult by the noncompliance itself—although at least a few, such as Mazzara, are already known—which is why it is appropriate for the Court to order an investigation into which Government officials willfully evaded the Court’s discovery orders,” according to the filing.Continuing the court caseThe attorneys are pushing to continue with the discovery process in order to identify the steps taken or the involvement of any other government officials who defied the court orders to return Abrego Garcia.“The lengths the Government has gone to resist discovery relating to these core questions raises a strong inference that the Government is trying to hide its conduct from the scrutiny of this Court, the Plaintiffs, and the public,” according to the filing. “What the Government improperly seeks to hide must be exposed for all to see.”The Trump administration on June 6 moved to dismiss Abrego Garcia’s civil suit filed in federal district court in Maryland, arguing it is moot after Abrego Garcia landed in the U.S. to face criminal charges in Tennessee.But Abrego Garcia’s lawyers are pushing to keep his civil case open in pursuit of the potential sanctions cited in the latest brief.“Until the Government is held accountable for its blatant, willful, and persistent violations of court orders at excruciating cost to Abrego Garcia and his family, this case is not over,” according to the brief by Abrego Garcia’s attorneys filed Sunday.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is urging insurers to continue covering vaccinations during pregnancy in an open letter signed by 30 prominent professional health organizations.
Pregnant patients and their infants are vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. In the letter to payers and insurance companies released this week, ACOG stressed the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations and how they protect babies and pregnant people. It was signed by prominent professional groups including the American College of Physicians, Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Public Health Association.
The letter follows U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy children and healthy pregnant patients, sidestepping an established decision process by scientists. Kennedy, who has made false claims questioning vaccine safety, earlier this week fired all 17 experts on the federal vaccine advisory committee panel, replacing them with eight new members, four of whom have spoken out against vaccines.
The Trump administration’s moves have alarmed health experts, who worry about coverage and access to the shot amid the agency’s dismissal of science.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

“We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” the letter reads. “Given the historic gaps in research, investment, and support for women’s health, it is essential that all aspects of obstetric and gynecologic care — including COVID-19 vaccination — be grounded in the best available scientific evidence.
Studies have shown babies born following a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have a higher risk of low birth weights, stillbirth and respiratory distress, and data demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
Pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are also at higher risk of complications such as blood clots, are more likely to be hospitalized in intensive care units or to need ventilators, and are at a higher risk of death, the letter notes.
Payers should make the vaccine available to “pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” the letter reads. Without insurance, a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 shot can cost roughly $140 for adults.
Following the recommendation rollback, public health officials in some states have emphasized their support of COVID-19 vaccines.
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, for example, said it “continues to recommend the current COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older,” noting that newborns “depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection.” Wisconsin Medicaid will also continue to cover the shot, the department said in a media release.
Officials in Georgia also said they expect continued coverage of the shot.
In Washington, a spokesperson for the state health agency told local media that the department is advising pregnant people to speak with their provider “to determine if receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is best for them.”
During this year’s legislative sessions, at least seven states introduced legislation aiming to ban or limit mRNA vaccines. Instead of using a weakened or dead version of the actual virus to stimulate an immune response, mRNA vaccines use a genetic code created in a laboratory to tell the body’s cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology.
“The COVID vaccines were a remarkable scientific accomplishment, and they remain the best tool that we have to prevent severe outcomes associated with COVID infection,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, ACOG president, wrote in a statement. “Ob-gyns know that COVID infection during pregnancy can be incredibly dangerous for our pregnant patients — and we know that the vaccine can protect both them and their infants after birth.”
When patients are “forced to pay out of pocket, or to cover high cost sharing,” he wrote, “they are less likely to be able to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser joined a court brief Thursday in support of California’s lawsuit looking to block President Donald Trump’s federalization and deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles. 
More than 20 attorneys general from Democratic-led states signed onto the brief in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California that says Trump’s actions are “unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic.” 
Trump has ordered a detachment of 700 U.S. Marines and thousands of National Guard troops to deploy to L.A. over the objections of state and local leaders, the first such move by a U.S. president since 1965. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sued to block the deployments, which he said “crossed a red line.”

The attorneys general said in the brief supporting Newsom’s case that the circumstances necessary for the president to legally federalize the National Guard are not present.
“By calling forth troops when there is no invasion to repel, no rebellion to suppress, and when state and local law enforcement is fully able to execute the laws, the President flouts the vision of our Founders, undermines the rule of law, and sets a chilling precedent that puts the constitutional rights of Americans in every state at risk,” the brief says. 
The memorandum Trump issued authorizing the military escalation is not specific to L.A. or California, leaving open the potential for similar responses in other states. He says the action was necessary to protect U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement agents and the broader public amid demonstrations that have damaged property. 
The amicus brief says court intervention is “vitally necessary to vindicate state sovereignty and protect the States’ National Guards.” It says each of the involved states are implicated by the “unlimited scope” of Trump’s memorandum, which allows him to deploy National Guard troops of any state for 60 days. 
Democratic leaders in Colorado decried the Trump administration’s response, and Colorado anti-ICE protests have grown since the escalations in L.A., with more than 1,000 people gathering outside the Colorado Capitol Tuesday night. 
Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, said the president must have a legal reason to federalize National Guard troops and that he “can’t just make up an emergency out of thin air.” State governors have authority over their National Guard units, but in certain circumstances, such as the danger of invasion, rebellion, or inability to enforce laws, the president has the authority to “federalize” them. 
“President Trump’s decision to deploy armed soldiers into the streets of our cities to engage in civil law enforcement violates our laws and Constitution and undermines the liberties we hold dear as Americans,” Weiser said in a statement.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)State government entities in New Mexico that act like courts when they resolve disputes can claim immunity from civil rights lawsuits, the state’s highest court ruled earlier this month in its first interpretation of the 2021 New Mexico Civil Rights Act.
However, the New Mexico Court of Appeals must still figure out whether the state’s horse racing regulator was acting like a court when it disciplined a horse trainer in the summer of 2021.
The New Mexico Supreme Court on June 2 ruled that state government entities sued under the New Mexico Civil Rights Act can claim “judicial immunity,” but stopped short of saying whether the New Mexico Racing Commission is immune from civil rights claims in this particular case.
The justices laid out a framework for determining when agencies under the state’s executive branch can use the defense against claims stemming from “quasi-judicial adjudicatory proceedings,” like disciplinary action.
Joshua Kastenberg, a law professor at the University of New Mexico, told Source NM the Supreme Court’s ruling preserves the law as the Legislature intended it.
“They wanted to make sure that the citizens would keep the state government accountable, except in the judicial arena,” Kastenberg said in a phone interview on Thursday. “So it’s a victory for all New Mexicans, but I don’t know if we can immediately say it’s going to benefit people other than it’s going to maintain that important balance of a functioning government and government accountability.”
Dispute over horse trainer’s license
Horse trainer Bradley Bolen alleges the Racing Commission violated his state constitutional rights by pursuing a vindictive prosecution against him. He argues the commission disciplined him in retaliation for advocating that his assistant trainer Isidro Rodriguez’s license be reinstated in July 2021.
Bolen alleged that Ron Walker, chief steward of racing at Ruidoso Downs, and Director Izzy Trejo initiated disciplinary proceedings against him, and ultimately imposed a $500 fine that was suspended so long as he didn’t receive any more discipline for a year.
Bolen appealed to the board of stewards but, before the administrative hearing on his appeal, he filed a civil rights complaint in district court and withdrew his appeal.
The Racing Commission argued that when it disciplined Bolen, it was acting like a court, which entitled it to immunity from his civil rights claims. This is called a “quasi-judicial immunity” defense.
District Court Judge Joshua Allison ruled that the commission isn’t entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, and the commission appealed. Then the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed and ruled that government entities can use this kind of defense in general, and the commission can use it in this case.
High court’s first swing at landmark law
The federal government and the United States’ 50 state governments have sovereign immunity, which means they cannot be sued unless lawmakers open up avenues to lawsuits, said Kastenberg, who teaches constitutional law, criminal law and evidence.
When the New Mexico Legislature wrote the state Tort Claims Act during the 20th century, it kept in place immunities that already existed, including judicial immunity, which is meant to protect judges from being sued for damages as a result of an allegedly corrupt decision, Kastenberg said.
“A judge, on the federal side or the state side, is supposed to be able to make their rulings free from the fear of public pressure or litigation, so that although their rulings may be wrong, they’re not pressured into making those rulings,” Kastenberg said.
In April 2021, New Mexico became one of the first states in the country to abolish qualified immunity through the New Mexico Civil Rights Act, making it possible for people to sue police officers and others in state court for constitutional rights violations.

This month’s ruling was the first time ever that the Supreme Court has interpreted the Civil Rights Act, the justices wrote. The new law preserved other kinds of immunity defenses, including judicial immunity, they wrote.
The justices sent the case back down to the lower court in order to analyze whether the Racing Commission was acting like a court when it pursued discipline against Bolen.

If the court finds that the Racing Commission wasn’t acting like a court, then it would be open to a lawsuit under the state Civil Rights Act, Kastenberg said.

“Bowen did not win in the sense that he hasn’t proven his civil rights were violated,” Kastenberg said. “He only won in the sense that he gets to have his day in court.”

In promoting his bill to fund professional sports stadiums, Missouri Republican state Sen. Kurtis Gregory warned about the potential hit to jobs and tax revenues if the state were to lose a team.
But on the floor of the Senate last week, he acknowledged that pride was also a prime motivator in his efforts to make hundreds of millions of dollars available to the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs and MLB’s Kansas City Royals, both of which are being courted to move several miles away into neighboring Kansas.
A former University of Missouri football player, Gregory pointed to the Missouri-Kansas rivalry that dates back to the Civil War and characterized Kansas as “kind of an archrival.”

“We just let the state of Kansas poach, you know, really the pride and joy of the western side of the state, and I would say the entire state of Missouri?” he said in his floor speech. “And then I would also say, what’s next? What’s the next thing the state of Kansas is going to try and take from us?”
Days after the 2025 legislative session ended in May, Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called a special session for lawmakers to consider stadium funding and disaster relief bills. Last week, the state Senate approved Gregory’s stadium incentives bill in the middle of the night by a 19-13 vote. On Wednesday afternoon, the state House approved the measure by a 90-58 vote, sending it to the governor’s desk.
The bill would fund up to 50% of construction or renovation costs and is estimated to cost about $1.5 billion over 30 years, the Missouri Independent reported.
Stateline was unable to reach Gregory for comment.
Economists have panned the ongoing stadium bidding war between Missouri and Kansas — which has offered to pay up to 70% of new stadium costs — as a waste of taxpayer dollars. But Gregory’s comments highlight the emotional undercurrents frequently at play in sports stadium funding debates across the country.
Experts nearly unanimously agree that public subsidies for stadiums are a poor investment, but that hasn’t slowed a wave of local and state spending for billionaire team owners.

Washington, D.C., could spend more than $1 billion to move the Washington Commanders some seven miles from a suburb in Maryland to a new facility planned for the old RFK Stadium site, described by the team’s controlling owner as the “spiritual home” of the NFL franchise.
Geoffrey Propheter, an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who studies stadium deals, said these kinds of arguments ignore the economic reality of stadium subsidies.
“You’re not talking economics. You’re talking pure emotion,” he said.
Despite mounds of evidence showing the public does not fare well on stadium investments, he said lawmakers and mayors still tout the potential for jobs and new tax revenues with stadiums and arenas.
Oftentimes, teams and politicians stir fears about the possibility of losing franchises to another market to increase pressure, he said. But three of the most prominent stadium subsidy deals under consideration now — in Chicago, Kansas City and the district — involve teams looking to move within the same metro area.
“I would appreciate it if lawmakers were that transparent, and they’re like, ‘I don’t care how much this costs, there’s no price that’s too high for us to pay to keep them here,’” Propheter said.

‘Generations to get past’

But cities and states have more at stake than raw economics, said Irwin Kishner, a New York attorney who has represented pro teams in multiple stadium deals.
He likened the stadium debate to those surrounding the Olympics: Research has found that host cities generally spend well in excess of the revenue generated by the games. But cities and nations still fiercely compete for the chance to host the high-profile event.
“It elevates the status of venues,” Kishner said. “And I think it’s very much the same thing with stadiums and arenas.”
He said cities also face potential economic consequences of lost jobs and tax revenues if teams leave altogether.
Oakland, California, for example, lost both its pro football and baseball teams to Nevada after local stadium talks fell apart. The NFL’s Raiders now play in Las Vegas and MLB’s A’s are playing temporarily in West Sacramento, California, before moving into their under-construction stadium on the Vegas strip.
“What happened in Oakland is a classic example of what happens when a team doesn’t get their building in the way they want it,” Kishner said.
And those sorts of relocations can leave lasting marks, he said, pointing to the sour feelings that still persist in Brooklyn decades after MLB’s Dodgers left for Los Angeles. Other cities have similarly iconic teams, such as the NFL’s Chicago Bears.
“When push comes to shove, municipalities would be embarrassed to lose a team. I mean, could you imagine the Bears playing in St. Louis as an argument?” Kishner said. “I think Chicago would have something to say about that in a very emotional way. And by the way, these things take generations to get past.”
Currently, Chicago’s stadium discussions are more localized.
After first sharing plans to build a new stadium along Lake Michigan’s shore in Chicago, the Bears are now pursuing a massive football stadium development in suburban Arlington Heights. Despite introducing various tax measures aimed to benefit megaprojects such as stadiums, Illinois lawmakers ended their session on May 31 with no action on the matter.










My brain tells me it’s not that big of a deal, but my heart and soul as a Chicagoan doesn’t want them to leave.


– Illinois Democratic state Rep. Kam Buckner


Democratic state Rep. Kam Buckner, whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side, said lawmakers have little appetite to invest heavily in stadiums.
The MLS’ Chicago Fire just announced plans to privately finance a new $650 million professional soccer stadium in the city’s South Loop — the same area the MLB’s White Sox are also eyeing as they explore a new baseball stadium.
“The days of widespread public money for private stadiums without public benefit — those days are over, and that is not just a sentiment in the state of Illinois. I think this is a sentiment across the country,” Buckner said.
Still, he acknowledged the sway emotions can have in the matter. While the Bears leaving the city limits likely would not affect the region’s economy, he said, it would still prove a blow to morale.
“My brain tells me it’s not that big of a deal,” he said, “but my heart and soul as a Chicagoan doesn’t want them to leave.”

Money matters

Missouri’s stadium debate has been simmering for years now: The Royals first announced plans in 2022 to move downtown from their stadium on the outskirts of the city. And the Chiefs — who share the sprawling stadium complex with the Royals — quickly followed with talks of wanting a new or renovated stadium.
After voters in a county election last year soundly rejected extending a stadium sales tax to fund those plans, lawmakers across the border in Kansas passed legislation that would fund up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums. That measure expires at the end of June, pushing Missouri legislators to act.
Neil deMause, a journalist who has written extensively about stadium subsidies, said such deadlines are arbitrary and meant to exact political pressure.
While politicians once had plausible deniability about the pitfalls of stadium subsidies, the research is now overwhelmingly clear and well covered in the media, he said. (It’s been nearly a decade since HBO’s John Oliver dedicated an episode of his satirical news show to the folly of stadium finance.)

But politicians on both sides of the aisle continue to push stadium subsidies — whether they’re touting the potential for wider real estate development or intangibles such as team pride and fears of losing franchises.
“It’s this prescribed dance, where everybody sort of pretends to be doing due diligence, but at the same time, everybody knows it’s going to happen,” deMause said.
He said that appears to be the case in the nation’s capital.
In April, city and team officials for the Washington Commanders announced plans for a 65,000-seat stadium. The proposed deal, which must be approved by the full city council, would cost taxpayers some $1.1 billion over eight years.
But deMause’s analysis of the plan determined the public will be spending well in excess of that figure because of billions in free rent and hundreds of millions in property tax breaks. He estimates taxpayers will pay or forgo at least $7.5 billion on the deal.
“Everybody in and around the D.C. Council seems to be saying, ‘Yeah, it sure is a lot of money, but the mayor really wants it, so it’s going to happen. It’s just a matter of whether or not we can improve it some,’” he said. “It’s a little bit like saying, ‘World War II is going to happen — just try and keep the death toll down.’”
Last week, Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office released a report it commissioned that projected the stadium would create billions in new economic output and local tax revenue in the coming decades — figures that were quickly disputed by skeptical economists and academics.
Still, much of the district’s stadium conversation has centered on intangibles such as hometown pride and nostalgia. Even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell waxed about his childhood memories attending games at the old RFK Stadium at an April event announcing the deal.
Sitting in front of a “WELCOME HOME” banner at that event, the mayor said the RFK site was “where they belong.”
“I want to start by saying welcome home,” she said.

For the first time in five years, the majority of low-income students across Tennessee will not receive supplemental grocery funds this summer to help bridge the months when they aren’t receiving school meals.
Tennessee this week will send one-time $120 payments to an estimated 25,000 low-income students in 15 counties to help pay for summer grocery costs. Tennessee’s largest counties, include Shelby and Davidson, are excluded from the program.
The program is a significant rollback of Tennessee’s previous summer food benefits initiative, which served an estimated 700,000 students across the state each summer since 2020 with the help of a state-federal partnership.
That program, known as summer EBT or SUN Bucks, ended this year when Gov. Bill Lee declined to continue the partnership, effectively rejecting an estimated $75 million in federal funds that provided the summer grocery benefits.
Signe Anderson, senior director of nutrition advocacy at the Tennessee Justice Center, called the decision to discontinue the federal EBT program “devastating” for food insecure families.
“Tennessee’s decision to serve fewer than 25,000 children in just 15 counties leaves vulnerable families with fewer options at a time when hunger is on the rise for Tennessee families,” Anderson said. “We have already started hearing from families who will not have the support this summer.”
Though many Tennessee school systems have other summer feeding programs to reach students when class is out of session, advocates in the state argue the programs can be restrictive or inaccessible for families with scheduling conflicts or transportation issues.

In Memphis, for example, around 100 different sites are serving meals and snacks at some point in the summer. However, the sites offer a patchwork of availability, with hours varying by location and some offering only a few days of meals.
Other providers are more flexible, like the dozens of YMCA locations across the state offering meal packs for pick up with a week’s worth of breakfast and lunch food. Still, advocates raise concerns about rural families who may live miles from a meal location.
The decision to end the federal EBT program sparked heated pushback from a Tennessee congressman and child advocates earlier this year who argued the federal dollars were an important tool to address food insecurity, a particularly concerning issue during summer months when some students lose access to the regular meals provided during a school day.
Amid questions from lawmakers about giving up the federal funds, Lee’s office announced a new, state-funded program to provide payments to a limited number of counties, which the administration said were selected due to the lack of summer feeding partners like the YMCA.
Tennessee Department of Human Services Commissioner Clarence Carter has referred to the scaled-back state program as a “fiscally responsible” approach. Lee’s administration cited the state’s share of administrative costs as one reason to discontinue the state-federal partnership first launched under the Biden administration in 2020.
However, it’s now costing Tennessee $3 million to distribute benefits in 15 counties, while under the federal program Tennessee was responsible for around $5 million in administrative costs to serve 95 counties.
“This is cruel to Tennessee families and fiscally irresponsible when the state could have served 700,000 children for less money if they had run the federal S-EBT option,” Anderson said.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The Louisiana Legislature overwhelmingly approved a $51 billion budget plan Thursday without funding for Gov. Jeff Landry’s signature private education voucher initiative, one that he initially promoted with much fanfare. 

Legislative leaders, especially in the Senate, had said for the past year that they weren’t going to fund the LA GATOR program in the budget cycle that starts July 1. Landy and state education Superintendent Cade Brumley pressed forward with launching the program anyway, attempting to force lawmakers into changing their minds with public pressure. 
In March, Brumley opened up applications for LA GATOR for the 2025-26 school year, even after Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said he didn’t think the extra slots would be funded. Now without the extra money from lawmakers, none of the nearly 30,000-plus students who applied for additional vouchers will have an opportunity to receive funding for private education. 

In the approved budget plan, lawmakers only included $43 million to pay for school vouchers for 5,600 students already attending private schools under a voucher program started more than a decade ago by former Gov. Bobby Jindal. Legislators rejected Landry and Brumley’s request to provide $50 million more for a more lenient, publicly-funded private education program that was supposed to include at least 5,300 more students. . 
Henry and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, have not committed to paying for more private education vouchers with public dollars in future years either.

Approximately three-quarters of the students who applied for LA GATOR this year are already attending private school, according to Henry and McFarland. It raises questions about whether extending vouchers to more families would actually help children escape inadequate public schools or simply subsidize families who are already sending their children to private institutions, Henry said. 

McFarland said on the state House floor Thursday that legislative leaders want “assurances that [the vouchers] are addressing the specific needs of those that are in failing [public] schools,” before providing more tax dollars to cover students ‘ private education.

Legislators have instead used some of the money Landry wanted for vouchers to continue a popular tutoring program for public schools that costs $30 million. Brumley has attributed Louisiana’s impressive gains on national reading assessments, in part, to the tutoring efforts. 

Another $18 million Landry wanted for LA GATOR will instead increase money sheriffs receive to house state prisoners in their parish jails. It raises the daily rate for holding approximately 15,800 state inmates in local lockups from $26.39 to $29.39.

So why subject them to a new tax when lawmakers could be making it easier — not more difficult — to access products that help them improve their health? (Getty Photo)Rhode Island lawmakers have slipped a new tax into the state’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget that could hurt people struggling with addiction and set back public health efforts in the state.
The proposal would institute a new and highly aggressive tax — nearly doubling the price — on tobacco-free nicotine pouches, a product that many adult smokers use to stop smoking. Unlike cigarettes, pouches provide users with a nicotine fix without the need to inhale deadly smoke. Users place a small, smokeless, pouch between their lip and gum, allowing nicotine to be absorbed into their bloodstream.
Unfortunately, nicotine pouches are often unfairly targeted by organizations and policymakers that base their attacks on misinformation about the products and their users.
As a licensed physician certified in the field of smoking cessation and a co-founder of a New England recovery clinic, I have spent more than 40 years treating patients who struggle with a variety of addictions including alcohol, narcotics, and nicotine. Most people with nicotine addictions are rightly focused on quitting one product in particular — cigarettes.
Health experts, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have recognized that tobacco and nicotine products exist on a “continuum of risk” with cigarettes by far posing the largest public health risk. This is because cigarettes require the user to inhale a deadly mix of chemicals that cause emphysema, cancer, and a wide range of health problems.
Nicotine, by comparison, is a highly addictive stimulant but is also non-carcinogenic. Therefore, it is in smokers’ best interest to move toward smoke-free products like nicotine pouches that pose substantially fewer risks to their health.
Reflecting this reality, the FDA recently authorized the marketing of ZYN nicotine pouches. In making this authorization, the FDA reported that “due to substantially lower amounts of harmful constituents than cigarettes” these nicotine pouches “pose lower risk of cancer and other serious health conditions.”
But rather than embrace the promise of these products, Rhode Island legislators are proposing a punitive tax that would make them significantly more expensive. They propose making nicotine pouches subject to the same excise tax of 80% of the wholesale cost for all smokeless tobacco products to nicotine pouches, effective Oct. 1. Other states like Maine, Illinois, and Minnesota have also taken a similarly misguided step to raise revenue.










Rather than embrace the promise of these products, Rhode Island legislators are proposing a punitive tax that would make them significantly more expensive.


Extending taxes to nicotine pouches is especially dangerous because we know there is an inverse relationship between smoking and income brackets. Households with less income are more likely to have smokers. Lawmakers rightly struck a proposed 50-cent tax hike on cigarette packs proposed in January in the governor’s budget. They should be making it easier — not more difficult — for them to access products better for their health.
Some tax supporters argue that smokers should only quit using pharmaceutical tools like gum, patches, and prescription medications, but my experience has been that these methods have a terribly low rate of success. Highly touted medications like Chantix work for less than 10% of people who try them and carry side effects like suicide ideation and psychosis.  
Excessive taxes on nicotine pouches are also not necessary to curb youth usage. Since the national age to purchase tobacco products was raised to 21 more than five years ago, youth tobacco use has sunk to its lowest levels ever. In fact, the most recent National Youth Tobacco Survey found that only 1.8% of young people reported using nicotine pouches.
When it comes to addressing the harm done by smoking, Rhode Island’s concerns should be on the nearly 10% of adults in the state who are cigarette smokers. These are the individuals who will be needlessly hurt by placing high taxes on products that could be key to overcoming their cigarette addiction.
As lawmakers seek to address Rhode Island’s budget shortfall, they should not do it on the backs of people who are seeking to make better choices for their health. An expensive tax on nicotine pouches is likely to make a small impact on the budget, but it will put a big dent in efforts to improve the state’s public health.

The money will go toward the purchase of the 200-acre Copper Crowne Equestrian Center in Opelousas. It was included in the state’s larger $50 billion budget plan passed Thursday. 
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said the facility was at risk of closure, and the purchase is necessary because it is “vital” to the horse racing industry. 
“It was a necessity to keep that facility open,” Henry said in an interview. 
Henry said there were discussions about whether to give the facility to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette or to LSU. Before the money was added into the budget bill, Henry said he had discussions with John Walters, LSU vice president for external affairs. 
Walters told the Illuminator he discussed the purchase with Henry, but that LSU did not ask for the facility and was not asked to approve the purchase. 
Walters said Henry told him it made more sense to give it to LSU than to ULL because LSU has a veterinary school and an AgCenter. 
Oliver Garden, dean of the LSU veterinary school, said he had not yet been “fully engaged” in conversations about the facility but added the school has a number of potential uses for it. 
LSU will receive the money for the purchase unless Gov. Jeff Landry uses his line-item veto power to remove it from the bill. 
The facility is currently owned by Harold Forman, a native New Orleanian in the construction business. Situated on over 200 acres, it is made up of a veterinary clinic, barns, an arena, a training track, a rehab facility and foaling and boarding facilities. 
Henry said the facility is valued at $7 million. The state will cover half the asking price, and the other half of the center will be donated to LSU.

Dr. Taylor Weckstein, a graduate of Harvard medical school, last year worked for several weeks in residency at the Indian Health Services in Shiprock, New Mexico. Her work included outreach trips in triple-degree weather. She saw people experience burns from concrete, severe dehydration and heat stroke, and the experience stayed with her.
“After seeing the suffering of some of the patients, I thought it would be really important to try and have data to look at these really stark health implications,” Weckstein told Source.
On June 9, the Journal of the American Medical Association published research Weckstein co-authored based on national emergency room visitation data in 2021 and 2022, which found homeless people visited emergency rooms for heat illness or injury at a rate 27 times higher than other people. While Weckstein expected homeless individuals to face greater exposure rates, the stark disparity surprised her.
“Heat stroke and heat-related-illness are preventable conditions and it’s pretty tragic that all those individuals are exposed to such dangerous levels of heat because there’s a lack of affordable housing,” Weckstein said. “As we’re trying to combat climate change, we need to consider which populations are most affected and how we can advocate for human-centered policies to protect those who are at greatest risk.”
Weckstein said further research is needed to better understand the scope of the issue and possibly break it out into regional trends.
“If anything, this research probably was an undercount of the magnitude of the problem,” Weckstein said, noting researchers only tracked heat-illness specific codes, and didn’t capture how extreme heat worsens kidney or heart conditions.
The study comes as New Mexico braces for a hot weekend — and rising temperatures in the years to come.










“As we’re trying to combat climate change, we need to consider which populations are most affected and how we can advocate for human-centered policies to protect those who are at greatest risk.”

‘We have to be proactive, rather than reactive’
Dangerously hot temperatures forecasted in the coming days have nonprofit advocates and providers bracing for “life or death” impacts to unhoused people in New Mexico’s largest cities. Advocates said governments at all levels need policies, funding and data to better address the threat.
According to the National Weather Service Heat Risk Map, Albuquerque this weekend could hit triple-digit temperatures for the first time this year, and Las Cruces highs are projected to reach 103 and 104 degrees for several days, with nighttime temperatures hovering at 70 degrees — making it harder for the body to cool off.
Local New Mexico officials said they’re monitoring for heat threats and ready to take action during extreme heat.
But it’s the overall hotter temperatures as a result of climate change that pose a continued threat, not just triple-digit days, said Nathaniel Matthews-Trigg, a board member for nonprofit Healthy Climate New Mexico.
“In New Mexico when the temperature reaches 90 degrees, we see emergency visits increase for heat, so really, any time you’re getting into the 90s, there is a risk,” Matthews-Trigg said.
Rio Rancho, Albuquerque and Las Cruces recently topped a USA Today analysis of cities with the largest increase of high-heat days — 90 degrees and upward — since 1985: 39, 36 and 31 more such days, respectively.
Matthews-Trigg said rising heat threats, particularly for unsheltered people with substance use disorders and mental illness, mean that cities need to do more to offer cooler spaces, water and support.
“All of those organizations that are working with those most vulnerable, we need to bring them in on the conversation and really intentionally plan,” he said.  “We can’t just leave it for the emergency to occur and then we do something; we have to be proactive, rather than reactive.”

‘Life or death implications’
Local officials in Albuquerque and Las Cruces told Source they are monitoring the heat risk situation this weekend, but as of Wednesday did not plan to extend cooling center hours, unless a power outage or further needs arise.










 “When it’s very hot, it has life or death implications for people living on the street.” 


– — Rachel Biggs, chief strategy officer for Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless


Doña Ana Assistant County Manager Steven Lopez said recent temperatures have not reached a threshold of 105 degrees on the heat index, also known as the “feels like” temperature. The county requires those high temperatures for several days to provide additional cooling sites, he said.
Outreach teams, which deliver water, hygiene kits, food and other supplies will be out late on Friday to “help people get stocked up” for the weekend, according to Nicole Martinez, the executive director with Mesilla Valley Community of Hope in Las Cruces.
Community of Hope operates an outdoor tent-shelter area, adding more shaded areas and misters. Martinez described a couple of close calls, with people overheating in the courtyard.
“It seems like we’re constantly assessing for heat exposure,” she said.
In Albuquerque, which the USA Today report described as “one of the hottest places in the country,” city officials emphasized long-term goals to address heat, such as planting more trees to increase shade and the ordinance requiring landlords to ensure rental units have cooling systems.
Services for homeless residents include increased outreach with delivery of water and supplies, along with increased referrals and transportation to city and nonprofit-run shelters, said Matthew Whelan, the deputy chief administrative officer at the city.
“When there’s extreme weather, it is always a concern for everyone in the city, but absolutely folks that are experiencing homelessness or at the top of that list,” said City of Albuquerque spokesperson Staci Drangmeister. “The city has moved away from opening up temporary cooling centers, as we have built out some more permanent infrastructure to support people and keep people out of the elements.”
Access to the Gateway Center, located on the far Westside, presents a hurdle for people spread throughout the city, said Rachel Biggs, chief strategy officer for Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless, a nonprofit that offers health care for unhoused people.
“I think there’s still a need beyond what the shelter is able to provide,” Biggs said. “Especially during these really challenging times when it’s very hot, it has life or death implications for people living on the street.”
Biggs said Albuquerque could learn from Arizona’s responses to extreme heat and homelessness. She pointed to that state’s strategy of prepositioning supplies before heat events. More water, towels and multiple cool-down areas required additional funding and resources, but the strategy contributed to lower heat deaths in Arizona last year for the first time in decades. Better responses for heat impacts such as education on heat safety, along with distributing sunscreen, water and protective clothing, help triage, but fail to address the root problem.
“We have the solution,” Biggs said. “It’s housing. If we all come together at all levels of government working together to provide access to affordable housing for everyone that needs it, we will see an impact on our health systems, on mortality.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska Board of Regents will consider a roughly 5% tuition increase at its meeting next week after state appropriations fell well short of NU’s request.
Nebraska lawmakers in May approved a 0.625% increase in state dollars for the next fiscal year ($4.35 million) at NU. But regents last August asked for a 3.5% increase, mostly to cover inflationary costs. NU President Jeffrey Gold said that while the Legislature must balance its budget, “the other side of the coin” is that NU faces similar inflationary pressures to the rest of state government.
Gov. Jim Pillen, a former regent for 10 years, initially suggested a 2% cut of state funding to NU, but federal funding cuts and freezes helped ignite new negotiations.
“While we’re not a supermarket or a car dealership, we still have to buy the same dozen eggs, the same tomatoes to feed our students,” Gold told the Nebraska Examiner this week.

Lawmakers, Gold and Pillen landed at a new “compromise” to increase state funding by 0.625% next year and 0.625% over that new baseline in the following fiscal year, both short of the annual 3.5% increase regents asked for. The state runs on a two-year budget cycle, but NU passes an annual budget.
Gold said NU leaders studied tuition at peer institutions, as well as within specific colleges and programs so NU maintained competitive tuition rates. Most are within the lowest quartile or decile, he said, or the lowest compared to other universities and colleges.
As a first-generation college student, Gold said he always has concerns that tuition increases could hurt enrollment, and he’s focused on trying to keep college as affordable as possible.
“Not to say that it’s not a significant change in tuition and that it is essentially asking families and students to pay more for their education out of pocket,” Gold said. “It is still a very conservative approach, with our focus on remaining affordable long term into the future.”
Increased costs
Under the proposal, NU’s $1.1 billion “state-aided budget” would increase by $19.07 million, the result of new state dollars and increased tuition, minus $2.5 million in declining investments. 
It’s an overall spending increase of about 1.8%.
Operational expenses would increase by $37.44 million, but Gold is seeking $18.37 million in cuts to balance new expenses and revenues. The increased costs are:

$22.31 million for general operations.
$12.73 million for faculty salaries (faculty at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and the University of Nebraska at Kearney are unionized.)
$7.78 million for health insurance (assuming a 7.25% increase in premiums).
$1.64 million for utilities.
$793,507 for employee benefits.

The budget also seeks to expand the “Nebraska Promise” — free tuition for any Nebraska student whose family makes $65,000 or less — by about $1 million and invest $2 million in deferred maintenance. 
Another $1.5 million will go to maintain the “Presidential Scholars Program” to waive tuition and pay students with top scores on the ACT to attend NU, for a 50-student annual cohort. Regents had asked for matching state fund, which did not come.
Gold said campuses are proposing planned reductions that will be ready by the end of the month. He said administrators are committed to closing any budget gap while also turning attention to a growing set of legislatively mandated tuition remissions, waiving tuition for law enforcement, public safety workers, firefighters, first responders, veterans and more.
While Gold said it’s good to offer higher education to those individuals and often their families, the roughly $10 million cost next year means sustaining those programs get more difficult. NU continues working with Pillen and lawmakers to find a solution.
No budget for salary bumps
While there is a net increase in faculty expenses, the NU budget shows a $12.34 million decrease in nonfaculty expenses, meaning the status quo for staff also won’t be maintained.
Jordan Gonzales, president of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Staff Senate, said in May he was “deeply disappointed” after Gold announced the budget would include no allocation for general salary increases or across-the-board raises.

Gonzales told UNL staff that investing in them “is not just a matter of fairness, but a strategic imperative for the long-term health and success of the University of Nebraska.” He predicted “significant, negative consequences,” including diminished morale and productivity, declines in recruitment, increased staff turnover and higher workloads passed on to remaining staff.
“Investing in our people is also critical if we truly aspire an odyssey to the extraordinary, especially if we want to create and maintain an extraordinary culture and environment,” Gonzales wrote, citing Gold’s long-term strategic plan.
Gold had said campuses can pay for promotions, often needed for recruitment and retention, but that those costs would need to be made up on individual campuses.
Federal challenges
Outside of the general state-aided budget, the total $3.57 billion NU budget (including cash funds, auxiliary funds, federal funds and trust funds) estimates that NU will receive about $11.85 million less in federal funds. NU is estimated to receive about $740.7 million in restricted federal funds.
Gold said federal cuts would predominantly be dealt with on a campus-by-campus and college-by-college level, such as if a research grant is canceled or indirect cost recovery rates are dropped. He noted that the current congressional tax-focused bill — dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” — calls to significantly reduce federal research funding.
It could be harder to compete for federal research grants, Gold said, and if a research program is terminated, NU would try to repurpose those researchers. If not, they could lose their jobs.
“These are very, very significant changes, and there’s no easy solution to this across the country,” Gold said. “But we’re going to do everything we can to protect our faculty and our staff who are involved in these research-intensive programs.”
Next UNK chancellor
Regents are also set to officially confirm Neal Schnoor as the next UNK chancellor.

Gold said he is excited for the “right person at the right time,” someone who knows Nebraska, Kearney and UNK “extremely well” as a former faculty member and administrator. Gold said the public vetting process has been “astoundingly positive” and that Schnoor understands how to focus on enrollment, leadership development and make hard decisions.
Schnoor is currently the president of Northern State University in South Dakota.
“It will be with a great sense of pride that I will recommend Neal Schnoor to be the next chancellor of UNK,” Gold said.
If confirmed, Schnoor would start July 1 with a $355,000 salary. He would succeed former UNK Chancellor Doug Kristensen, who retired May 2024 after 22 years.
The regents will meet at 9 a.m. June 19 in NU’s Varner Hall in Lincoln.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Students attending Iowa’s public universities will see costs increase once again for the next school year after the Iowa Board of Regents set rates Thursday for resident and nonresident, undergraduate and graduate student tuition and fees.
Despite calls from students in previous meetings to keep tuition flat and help keep higher education affordable and accessible, the board approved 3% increases to resident undergraduate tuition at the University of Iowa and Iowa State University and a 2.7% increase at the University of Northern Iowa. Tuition and fees for other categories of students will also rise at varying rates.

One section taken out of the proposed tuition and fees was UNI’s proposed tuition and fees for nonresident undergraduate students from states bordering Iowa, which would have been equal to what resident undergraduate students pay.
Board of regents Chief Business Officer Brad Berg said during the meeting the board will vote on those rates at a later meeting, as Gov. Kim Reynolds line-item vetoed funding for the tuition program before signing education appropriations legislation June 11.
The board voted unanimously to approve all other proposed tuition and fee increases.
Anne Moore, a UI student and graduate research assistant in the university library system, said Wednesday during the board’s public comment period she paid more than $1,000 in mandatory fees in the last academic year — more than a monthly rent payment — even after she received a 58% discount as a union-represented graduate worker.
Fees for UI graduate students will increase by 3% for both resident and nonresident students in the upcoming year, according to the board document, bringing the total cost to $1,829.
International students face even higher fees, Moore said, and those surveyed by the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students, or COGS, have reported increased rates of food insecurity.
“While we struggle to have our basic needs met while pursuing higher education, the regents want to raise tuition and raise our fees even higher,” Moore said. “You are leaving students, workers and families wondering how they’re going to make up the difference.”
Members of the board of regents have a “duty to keep education accessible and affordable for the people of Iowa,” Moore said, and if they want to attract students and keep people in the state, they shouldn’t be “nickel and diming students” while approving multimillion-dollar capital projects and other programs.
“Education is a right, not just for the rich and white,” Moore said. “Keep Iowa education affordable.”
Board approves director, president pay
The board of regents also approved increases to compensation for board Executive Director Mark Braun and university presidents, with new pay for all positions starting July 1.
Regent David Barker said Braun’s base salary will increase to $176,384 and he will receive a new, two-year deferred compensation plan with planned annual payments of $230,000. Board President Sherry Bates will have “the authority to negotiate and finalize a retirement incentive agreement to be effective July 2, 2027,” Bates added.
Braun’s current salary is $154,000, according to state records.

Garlin Gilchrist at the State of the State speech, Jan. 24, 2024 | Anna Liz NicholsLt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, a candidate to try and become Michigan’s next governor, has joined with 20 other Democratic lieutenant governors in condemning President Donald Trump’s move to deploy the California National Guard and United States Marines against protestors speaking out against immigration raids in Los Angeles. 
As of Wednesday, 4,100 California National Guardsmen and 700 U.S. Marines were present in the greater Los Angeles area, ABC reports, with orders to defend federal buildings and law enforcement. About 500 of the National Guard troops deployed to the city have been trained to accompany agents on immigration raids, the Associated Press reports. 
Since Saturday, the Los Angeles Police Department has made nearly 400 arrests and detentions, with the vast majority stemming from protestors refusing to disperse at law enforcement’s request. Two men have been charged with possessing molotov cocktails while the Los Angeles district attorney announced charges against more than a dozen people Wednesday for crimes including assaulting peace officers, grand theft and vandalism.
In a statement, members of the Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association said they were “deeply disturbed by the chaos unfolding in Los Angeles caused by President Trump’s reckless abuse of power.” They accused the President of using communities as a political battleground for retribution and to project force and fear. 
“Deploying federal troops and threatening military action in our neighborhoods is not only unconstitutional, it’s profoundly dangerous,” they said. 
With California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis opposing the president’s decision to deploy the National Guard and U.S. Marines within the city, the Association offered its solidarity with their fellow Democratic executives. 
“The streets of Los Angeles – or any of our communities – should not be a stage for Trump’s political posturing. We stand united against this manufactured crisis, and we will defend the rights to peaceful protest and organize, without federal interference or intimidation,” they said. 
On Sunday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and 21 other Democratic Governors issued a statement condemning the president’s action as an overreach of his authority.
Newsom filed a suit on Monday, arguing the federal government had overstepped, bypassing his approval as the commander-in-chief of the California National Guard in a situation where federal intervention was not needed. 
A hearing is set for Thursday afternoon.

(Photo by David Wren/SC Daily Gazette)A taxpayer-funded rail and cargo hub for the Port of Charleston is behind schedule and over budget, and legislators are hoping to learn more about those problems in the coming weeks.
The Navy Base Intermodal Facility in North Charleston will not open as scheduled on July 1. A sister project that would move cargo containers between port terminals by barges is on indefinite hold.

Lawmakers set aside $550 million from the state’s general fund for both projects in 2022.
Now, the state’s Joint Bond Review Committee is seeking answers from the S.C. State Ports Authority, which is in charge of building the cargo hub and barge system. A subcommittee that provides financial oversight of big-ticket spending is looking to schedule a meeting in July to hear from the ports authority.
“We need to hear from port leadership about the delay and whether it’s going to be two months, three months, nine months or 36 months,” said Sen. Sean Bennett, R-Summerville, a member of the fiscal oversight panel. “If it’s an extended period of time, that’s a concern for everybody.”
The ports authority declined to comment on the status of the cargo hub – a rail yard where cargo boxes will be transferred between trucks and trains operated by CSX Corp. and Norfolk-Southern railroads.
The maritime agency said Barbara Melvin, its president and CEO, will update the project in open session during a ports board meeting on Tuesday. She told a Charleston maritime group this week that the cargo hub won’t open until early next year.
Melvin also told the group that state lawmakers are aware of the delays, according to a report by The Post and Courier. But those interviewed by the SC Daily Gazette said they’ve been given little information.
Bennett said the state’s investment in the cargo hub could be hurt, depending on how long it takes before the facility starts making money.

“The longer the delay, the worse it gets,” he said.
Also at question is the project’s ballooning cost.
The project started with a $400 million price tag, which included repayment of a $51 million loan to pay for initial planning documents.
The cost had grown to $468 million, not counting the loan, when Melvin updated legislators a couple years ago. She said at the time that any cost overruns would be paid for by the ports authority. A current budget for the project was not available.
“These are the sorts of things that pique my interest,” Rep. Micah Caskey, R-West Columbia, said of the project delays and cost overruns. Caskey, also a member of the oversight panel, said the group is trying to coordinate a meeting time to learn more about the issues.
Potential project delays have angered legislators in the past.
The ports authority promised legislators the NBIF would open in mid-2025 when money for the project was first appropriated in 2022. In August of the next year, Melvin told the fiscal oversight committee the NBIF might not fully open until 2026.
That news didn’t sit well with the panel, which told Melvin to find a way to get the entire project built on time.
“It was never envisioned that it would be ‘26 before we opened and had everything fully completed and functional,” former state Sen. Nikki Setzler, then-chairman of the subcommittee, said at the time. Setzler has since retired.
Part of the delay has been due to disagreements between CSX and Norfolk-Southern over how their trains will access the container transfer site, which has been in the works for more than a decade.

Melvin has also blamed tariffs, trade uncertainties, a changing business climate and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that forces the ports authority to use union labor at new terminals – citing training issues – for the delays.
A Norfolk-Southern spokesperson said this week that the railroad is “not quite able to dive into those specifics at this time,” when asked when it expects to begin using the NBIF. The railroad referred further questions to the ports authority.
A CSX spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Ryan Johnson, a spokesman for North Charleston, said the ports authority has not told the city when the NBIF is expected to open.
The ports authority has long lobbied for a rail-based cargo hub near its waterfront terminals, saying the lack of on-dock or near-dock rail puts the Port of Charleston at a disadvantage to other ports.
Charleston is the only major East Coast port without such rail access.
“This critical infrastructure project will greatly enhance SC Ports’ capacity, allowing imports and exports to swiftly move between the hinterland and the Port of Charleston,” Melvin said in a statement last year.
About 300,000 containers, or roughly 25 percent of the port’s annual total, are moved by rail each year, with trucks handling the rest. The NBIF will have the capacity to nearly triple that number while potentially eliminating thousands of tractor-trailer trips along local roads and state highways.
Once completed, the 118-acre NBIF will have about 78,000 linear feet of track, a container stacking area, an administrative building, security booths, truck gates and six electric gantry cranes that span over tracks where cargo containers will be moved between trucks and trains.
The project also includes work to minimize the impact of rail traffic on local roads.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Floridians in more than 70 cities throughout the state plan to join nationwide demonstrations to protest the Trump administration on Saturday, prompting Attorney General James Uthmeier and other law enforcement officials to say they won’t hesitate to quash protests.
The protests, part of the “No Kings” movement, are set to take place the same day as the multimillion-dollar military parade in D.C. and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.
Uthmeier, who along Gov. Ron DeSantis has been criticizing the protests in downtown Los Angeles against Trump’s immigration crackdown, said he wanted to put the public on notice before Saturday. Trump sent the California National Guard into the city despite opposition from Gov. Gavin Newsom, and the California governor rejected DeSantis’ offer to send the Florida State Guard, according to the Miami Herald.
“If you want to wreak havoc and destruction in Florida, we have enhanced penalties to ensure you will do time, so we do not tolerate rioting. As groups talk about assembling over the weekend, we haven’t seen much of that in Florida,” Uthmeier said during a press conference in Brevard County.
However, protests are planned in all the state’s major cities, including in front of the Florida Historic Capitol in Tallahassee, according to the movement’s website.
The messaging from Uthmeier reflects Trump’s warnings that those who protest the D.C. parade will be met with “very heavy force.”
“If you resist lawful orders, you’re going to jail. Let me be very clear about that: if you block an intersection or a roadway in Brevard County, you are going to jail,” said Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey. “If you flee arrest, you’re going to go to jail tired because we are going to run you down and put you in jail. … If you throw a brick, a fire bomb, or point a gun at one of our deputies, we will be notifying your family where to collect your remains at because we will kill you.”
Uthmeier also announced that Florida Highway Patrol troopers would start patrolling the houses of federal immigration officials who believe they have been doxxed.

(Courtesy Indiana State Teachers Association)Nearly 300 Hoosier students will receive up to $40,000 each to pursue careers in education through the state’s Next Generation Hoosier Educators Scholarship program, higher education officials announced this week.
The Indiana Commission for Higher Education awarded 295 awards for the 2025–26 academic year. The renewable scholarship provides up to $10,000 per year for four years. In exchange, recipients agree to teach for five years at an eligible Indiana school or repay a prorated amount.
Now in its ninth year, the program aims to address the state’s ongoing teacher shortage by supporting students committed to staying in the profession.
“Teachers inspire confidence in the next generation and prepare students for future career success,” said Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education Chris Lowery. “The Next Generation Hoosier Educators Scholarship is a key strategy to build Indiana’s future teacher workforce with high-quality talent. The students selected for this opportunity have the passion and determination to make a difference in classrooms across the state.”
The 2025-2026 application cycle drew a record 1,091 applicants — a 15% increase over last year — from 326 high schools across 89 of Indiana’s 92 counties, according to CHE. Of those applicants, 73% were high school seniors and the rest were current college students.
State lawmakers expanded the annual scholarships in 2023, increasing awards from $7,500 to $10,000. The previous 200-recipient cap was also lifted, and a one‑time $10,000 grant was introduced for students enrolled in approved “transition to teach” programs.
Funding for the program was reduced in the state’s new two-year budget passed earlier this year, however, with annual appropriations dropping from $12 million to $11.4 million. The cut was part of broader budget cuts across state government. It’s not yet clear how the reduced funding might affect future scholarship awards.
To qualify, students must meet academic criteria including ranking in the top 20% of their high school class, earning a 3.0 GPA or better, or scoring in the top 20th percentile on the SAT or ACT. Scholarship recipients must maintain a 3.0 GPA and complete at least 30 credit hours per year to remain eligible while in college.
The full list of scholarship recipients by county is available online at che.in.gov.

(Photo via Google Earth)One of Iowa’s largest nursing home chains is denying allegations that it fired a nurse in retaliation for her quality-of-care complaints to state regulators.
The chain, Care Initiatives of West Des Moines, is currently facing three separate whistleblower lawsuits stemming from unrelated incidents. The company operates 44 care facilities in Iowa.
In the most recent case, Tina Weber of Clemens states that from May 2021 through October 2024, she worked as a registered nurse at an unspecified Care Initiatives facility in Marshall County.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Weber claims that on Oct. 5, 2024, she witnessed an incident involving a resident with schizophrenia, using a wheelchair, and a human resources worker. According to the lawsuit, the two were engaged in an argument and when the resident attempted to leave in his wheelchair, the human resources worker grabbed the handles of the wheelchair, causing the resident to fall out of the wheelchair to the ground.
Weber reported the incident to the assistant director of nursing and recorded the incident in the resident’s chart. The next day, Weber alleges, the home’s director of nursing texted Weber, writing, “Could you strike out original note and when putting in about the wheelchair say she was assisting with the wheelchair and he put himself on the ground as she tried to de-escalate him and explain that he was not allow to smoke and the policy?”
Weber allegedly responded, “So not the truth?”
On Oct.  11, 2024, an administrator allegedly asked Weber to change her account of the incident in the resident’s chart. Weber refused. Later that day, the lawsuit alleges, a corporate employee of Care Initiatives instructed Weber to change the resident’s chart so it didn’t indicate the resident’s fall was the result of an altercation with the staff. Weber again refused and, the lawsuit claims, she then reported the incident to state regulators who forwarded it to the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which oversees nursing homes.
Five days later, a state inspector visited the nursing home to investigate the matter, the lawsuit alleges. The next day, the lawsuit alleges, Care Initiatives fired Weber.
The lawsuit claims the company fired Weber due to her reports and complaints regarding the health, safety, and well-being of one of its residents. The lawsuit seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages for Weber’s firing.
In its response to the lawsuit, Care Initiatives says it “did not terminate or take any adverse action at any time against (Weber) for participation in any alleged protected activity, including her alleged reports/complaints-both internally and externally.” The company says that it acted in good faith, without malice or disregard of Weber’s rights.
A trial is scheduled for June 9, 2026.
‘Keep your mouth shut’
Care Initiatives is currently the target of two other lawsuits alleging a form of whistleblower retaliation.
In one of those cases, Tylene Schultz states that in the summer of 2022, she was hired at Fonda Specialty Care by its then-administrator, Jennifer Blair, to work in the home as a certified nursing assistant.
On Feb. 18, 2023, the home allegedly scheduled a temp-agency nurse, Becky Manning, to work the overnight shift due to a shortage of staff nurses. During the shift, a resident with a tracheostomy passed away about 2:25 a.m., according to the lawsuit.
State records indicate the resident who died was 87-year-old Marvin “Pete” Jacobs, who had undergone a tracheostomy and needed regular suctioning of his airway. The lawsuit claims Jacobs died because throughout the shift, Manning refused to numerous requests to suction Jacobs’ airway.
“Despite multiple requests by Schultz to suction the resident — over 10 times, from 6 p.m. on Feb.18, 2023, to 2:25 a.m., Feb.19, 2023 — Manning would not suction the resident, nor did she attempt to use the suction machine,” the lawsuit claims.
According to the lawsuit, after Schultz left the home at the end of her shift, she received multiple text messages from Blair that said, “Keep your mouth shut and keep your opinions to yourself,” along with instructions that she should not communicate with Jacobs’ family.
Later that day, Schultz was summoned to a meeting with Blair at Fonda Specialty Care. During the meeting, the lawsuit claims, Blair — who was allegedly was aware Schultz planned to call state regulators and report her concerns with Jacobs’ care — informed Schultz she was being fired due to “resident complaints.”
Manning was charged with felony wanton neglect of a resident of a health care facility and later was sentenced to two years in prison on a reduced charge of misdemeanor wanton neglect. Manning also entered into an agreement with the Iowa Board of Nursing in which she agreed to indefinitely suspend her practice of nursing.
Schultz’s lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for wrongful termination. Care Initiatives has denied any wrongdoing and alleges that Schultz’s dismissal was based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory, and nonretaliatory business reasons.
A trial is scheduled for Aug. 4, 2026.
Caregiver helped resident call 911
The third current whistleblower case against Care Initiatives involves Kandus Jellison, who worked at the company’s Oakwood Specialty Care in Albia. Jellison has alleged she was fired in June 2022 after she intervened on behalf of a resident who was refused hospital care and then helped the man call 911.
Jellison sued Care Initiatives in part for allegedly violating the Iowa law that bars employers from taking action against workers for reporting dependent adult abuse or assisting with an abuse-related complaint or investigation.
Care Initiatives has argued that while it’s a crime for a company to retaliate against workers who assist with abuse investigations, the Iowa Legislature didn’t intend for workers to use such a violation as the basis for a civil lawsuit. A judge agreed and dismissed one element of the lawsuit, but let the remainder of the case proceed.
Care Initiatives has denied any wrongdoing in the matter, and a trial is scheduled for March 30, 2026.
A fourth whistleblower case against Care Initiatives was settled several months ago. In that case, Stephanie Schlegelmilch sued the company, alleging that while working as the director of nursing for the chain’s Avoca Specialty Care, she was terminated in violation of public policy.
Schlegelmilch alleged she was fired shortly after she confronted a regional nurse for Care Initiatives and questioned why she wasn’t wearing a mask during a COVID-19 outbreak in the home.
Care Initiatives denied any wrongdoing in the case, and the case was dismissed in December 2024 after an out-of-court settlement was reached.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-12 16:11:09+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Community garden projects regroup after USDA grant terminations, forging ahead",Steph Quinn,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/12/community-garden-projects-regroup-after-usda-grant-terminations-forging-ahead/,"The USDA notified commmunity garden project leaders it had canceled their grants, saying they were engaged in DEI initiatives.","The three-person team behind a growing network of gardens and community spaces in Jackson’s Midtown neighborhood received word in February that they had been chosen to receive $10,000 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
In April, that group – the Farm to Community team of the Jackson nonprofit Midtown Partners – was notified that they would not receive the funding. The team lost the federal money after the USDA terminated a $157,827 grant slated to help a dozen groups throughout Mississippi establish or sustain community gardens in underserved communities. The USDA canceled the grant, the notice said, because the nonprofit that had won the grant and chosen garden projects in Mississippi to receive the money, engaged in “diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.” 
That nonprofit, Community Resources Connection in South Carolina, declined to comment about the USDA decision but updated its website this week to say that “the Community Garden contract between USDA and CRC has been terminated because of the current administration’s change in priorities” and that no funds are available for the Community Garden program at this time.
Executive orders President Donald Trump issued in January kicked off a sweeping review of grants by the USDA, as the department sought to root out support for DEI programs Trump described as “radical and wasteful” and climate initiatives he said hindered the administration’s priority of “unleashing American energy.”
Though USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins has defended the department’s grant terminations as reducing waste, leaders of community garden projects throughout Mississippi said that past federal funding has enabled them to cultivate food self-sufficiency and community cohesion. Now lost grant opportunities are forcing them to adjust plans and look for alternative funding.
Linda Fondren, founder and executive director of Shape Up Mississippi in Vicksburg, said her organization lost $10,000 in federal funding due to the USDA’s cancellation of the same grant. Due to that loss, the nonprofit will postpone its fifth annual Youth Agriculture and Health Extravaganza Day, which has featured nutrition and agriculture classes, cooking demonstrations and a petting zoo in past years.

Norma Michael, founder of the Sharing is Caring Neighborhood Block Garden in Jackson’s Georgetown neighborhood, had planned to install a drip irrigation system using $1,000 from the same USDA-canceled grant. Though she was able to obtain the funding elsewhere, Michael said, the USDA’s decision on the grant was disappointing.
“I think that it’s disheartening that programs that help people that are underserved are being cut,” Michael said. “That just makes us even more underserved.”
Matt Casteel, farm consultant for Midtown Partners’ Farm to Community team, said past federal funding has helped the group to establish relationships and infrastructure to pursue its broader vision of a walkable network of community spaces across Midtown. 
“That’s something that we’re building as our bigger vision, is to be the resource and the mycelium, if you will, that connects and keeps that structure together,” Casteel said.
The team used a two-year, $98,041 Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grant to establish a teaching garden on the campus of Midtown Public Charter’s primary school and purchase hydroponic towers for the primary and middle schools.

Since the fall, the group has also hired lifelong Midtown resident Dewaskii Davis as farm coordinator.
Davis said he is passionate about empowering others in Midtown to participate in Farm to Community events, as well as start their own rain barrels and plant their own gardens.
“No cheat codes, no chemicals, just hard labor,” Davis said. “But it’s worthy and worth it at the end.”
Congress approved the Farm to School program as part of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which mandated a minimum of $5 million to farm-to-school competitive grants annually to address hunger and improve children’s nutrition – a vital issue in Mississippi, where the childhood poverty rate is 23%. The USDA announced the cancellation of $10 million in fiscal year 2025 funding for that program in late March with no explanation. 
Though Midtown Partners’ 2024 grant was unaffected, the group had hoped to re-apply in a future funding cycle.
“I’ve applied for over $2.3 million in grants, and we’ve received about 250,000,” said Jina Daniels, Midtown Partners’ creative economy coordinator. “We keep at it. Every little bit helps.”
Prophetess Robinson, principal of the private K-12 Ron’s Brothers Academy in Picayune, said it’s difficult for her and her staff to find time to apply for grants on top of their teaching and administrative duties. 
Robinson applied for a Patrick Leahy Farm to School grant to replace the school’s garden, which was destroyed this winter in a fire that began on a neighboring lot. But she was notified that that program had been canceled before she received feedback on the school’s application.
“One of the kids just asked me, ‘Miss Robinson, are we going to do the gardening? What are we going to do?” 
Robinson said the school has put its plans for a new, bigger garden on pause. 
“There was no way we’d be able to do it just on our resources alone.”
Fondren highlighted the importance of Shape Up Mississippi’s robust network of volunteers and partner organizations in Vicksburg.
Although the loss of USDA funding was a blow, she said,Shape Up Mississippi will continue to hold public “U-Pick Days” at the group’s community garden – the result of a partnership with Alcorn State University and the city of Vicksburg – throughout the summer. Those harvests are split between local shelters and for families to take home. 
“If you could see the children, the families that come out and pick,” Fondren said, “it’s a social gathering. They are so excited about what is happening there.”
Fondren said she and Shape Up Mississippi’s partner organizations in Vicksburg have spent the past few months looking at the loss of grant funding as an opportunity for growth.
“You become resilient,” she said. “How do you keep this going? And so that is what our thought process is. Let’s turn this into something positive.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12105052/water_harvester.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

While public health officials have been swift to make lifesaving drugs like naloxone accessible to the public, other local experts are emphasizing the need for awareness and education.
“It’s important for our residents to know what’s happening,” Hansuld said. “This indicates to me that there is more concentrated fentanyl or just a more dangerous strain of the substance that they’re seeking. It’s good for everyone to know so they can be prepared in case that happens to them or somebody close to them.”
DCCCA has funded a naloxone vending machine outside of a Lawrence Transit station near the University of Kansas campus since Feb. 2024, providing free nasal spray when residents enter their zip code. Douglas County residents also can request free naloxone and fentanyl test strips online through DCCCA’s website.
“This is a communitywide and national challenge that demands a coordinated, multifaceted response,” said Ryan Sztorch, senior director of crisis services at Bert Nash Community Mental Health Center in Lawrence. “Reducing stigma is a key part of that process.”
Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health provides naloxone and fentanyl test strips as well as education on how to use them. Executive director Jonathan Smith said it’s crucial to share accurate, timely information about the clinic’s resources to save lives.
“This is a moment for the community to be alert and educated about resources available to prevent overdoses from happening,” Smith said. “The most important thing we can do is act early, raise awareness, and make sure people know where to go for support.”
Organizations are working to spread awareness about the rise in overdoses across the county. For Douglas County, collaboration has been key in helping address the opioid crisis.
“Our community is fortunate to have a wide range of strengths and resources, and it’s only through collective action that we can make meaningful progress,” Sztorch said. “Each of these partners brings unique strengths — whether it’s providing treatment, coordinating care, distributing Narcan, or offering lifesaving interventions. This united front is a testament to the power of community and shared purpose.”
Bert Nash partners with first responders across the county to provide not only treatment but also mental health resources. Sztorch says that reducing the stigma of substance use means recognizing substance use disorders the same way we would other medical conditions, as well as their connection to mental health.
“Normalizing substance use disorders as medical conditions — just like diabetes or heart disease — is essential to saving lives,” said Sztorch. “We also need insurance providers to recognize and support treatment for substance use disorders on par with other health conditions. We know that mental health and substance use are deeply interconnected — addressing one often supports healing in the other.”
Although experts haven’t identified a root cause to the uptick in overdoses, they agree the goal is to continue educating Douglas County residents and providing resources to those in need.
“Our focus right now is on preventing further harm,” Smith said. “The resources are here, and we want to make sure our community knows how to access them.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9401-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Estenson photo provided by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly. Other photos provided by the candidates.)A North Dakota Republican Party fixture and two relative newcomers are seeking to lead the state party during a time of division between establishment and populist factions.
Shane Goettle, a lobbyist who served in U.S. Sen. John Hoeven’s administration, is among the candidates to succeed Sandi Sanford as chair of the state party. Goettle, of Mandan, is a former North Dakota national committeeman who lost the spot last year during a state convention that saw several endorsements go to less traditional candidates.
Others to announce their candidacy are former state Sen. Judy Estenson of Warwick and District 8 NDGOP vice chair Matthew Simon of rural Bismarck. The North Dakota Republican State Committee will gather in Bismarck on Saturday to elect a new chair for the next two years.
Sanford, who narrowly won over Perrie Schafer two years ago, is not seeking reelection. 
Republicans control all elected statewide and federal offices in North Dakota and hold supermajorities in the state Legislature. The election of a new party leader comes a year after a contentious state primary in which several conservative Republicans sought to oust more moderate incumbents and longtime legislators skipped district endorsing conventions citing concerns of an unfair process.
Incumbent Republican legislators see big wins over primary challengers across North Dakota

Bob Harms, a former NDGOP chair from 2013 to 2015, said the party needs a leader who can bring unity.
“Right now, we need somebody who can help bring the party together to reduce some of the division and the rancor and the discord that exists, and much of the gamesmanship that is out there on both the right and the left of the party,” Harms said.
Goettle, who has held previous roles in the state party, said he’s running for chair because he believes the NDGOP needs steady, fair and principled leadership. 
“We can have our differences. That’s OK,” Goettle said. “We can even battle that out somewhat within the party, but that’s where it should happen … with debate, with dialog and with a lot of patience.”
Estenson said in an announcement that the election comes at a pivotal time for the NDGOP.
“Our party stands at a crossroads,” Estenson said as she announced her candidacy, emphasizing a need to “reaffirm our commitment to conservative principles.”
In an interview, she said she hopes to bring more unification and openness to the party.
“You want to do things in a very fair, transparent way and I want our districts to do the same,” she said. “It all starts at the grassroots and I want our districts to be committed to that same thing.”
Estenson represented District 15 during the 2023 legislative session. A judge’s ruling in a redistricting case shifted district boundaries and Estenson lost election in 2024 in District 9. She now serves as NDGOP District 9 chair.

Simon said he would like to see more transparency and open forums in the Republican Party process.
“Right now, there’s a lot of mystique behind what we actually do as a party at the state level,” Simon said. “I think that could be fairly easily resolved by just more public engagement.”
He also said divisions between factions within the party are not “irreparable,” but in-depth discussions need to be had on “what it is to be a Republican.” Simon said the party platform is supposed to be the unifying force within the party that represents an 80% consensus of its membership.
Sanford said she decided against seeking reelection after consulting with members of the state and national party.
“I just decided that I’m not the person to continue and I think it’s best for someone else to jump in,” Sanford said.
The NDGOP reorganization meeting is closed to the public.

A group seeking to upend a new minimum wage law passed in February submitted a petition for referendum to the Michigan Board of State Canvassers on Wednesday – a move that restaurant groups have called misguided.
Meanwhile, supporters of the proposed referendum submitted by Voters to Stop Pay Cuts said the Michigan Supreme Court upheld 2018 voter-initiated laws to change the state’s minimum wage law and that the Michigan Legislature should have let those laws go into effect without meddling with them.
One Fair Wage, which helped to spearhead the movement to change the minimum wage law only to have their attempts circumvented by the Michigan Legislature – twice – in a statement said workers are now prepared to fight the law head on.
“The Michigan Supreme Court ruled that these wage increases should be implemented, yet lawmakers rolled them back before they even took effect,” said Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, in a statement. “We’re mobilizing to ensure voters – not politicians – have the ultimate say in whether these protections are upheld.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In proposed voter referendum language submitted to the Board of State Canvassers on Tuesday, Voters to Stop Pay Cuts said it is seeking to repeal Public Act 1 of 2025, which was born from Senate Bill 8, introduced by state Sen. Kevin Hertel Jr. The Michigan Legislature passed the bill in February and the bill was signed into law by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer shortly thereafter.
The act was a compromise with tipped-wage workers and restaurants who foretold doom and gloom if Michigan phased out tipped wages and instituted a more than $12 an hour minimum wage. That was likely without action from the Legislature after the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that two voter-initiated laws passed in 2018 should have gone into law as written. The Legislature gutted the 2018 changes to minimum wage, tipped wages and paid sick time in the same session they were passed, which prevented the issues from going before the voters. 
It was a controversial move known as “adopt and amend” because legislators took up the legislation, circumventing voter input, and then amending them in the same session. Organizers who supported the initiatives sued and argued the scheme was unconstitutional. The Michigan Supreme Court’s liberal majority agreed and struck down the amended laws in a landmark 4-3 decision. The state’s high court also determined that the Legislature had no authority to adopt voter-initiated laws and amend them in the same session.
With that, the laws were set to go into effect in 2025, but a movement supported by tipped wage workers, restaurant and hospitality business owners rallied support to have the Legislature step in and amend the laws – which was now allowed because the appropriate time had passed for the Legislature to amend the laws. Whitmer signed the bill in February.
The resulting Public Act 1 of 2025 set minimum wage $12.48 in 2025, $13.73 in 2026, and $15 an hour starting in 2026. The act also kept tipped wages intact and raised their percentage of hourly wage on a graduated scale up until 2030, much like it did with non-tipped workers’ minimum wage.
Voters to Stop Pay Cuts would like that law exorcised from statute, with referendum language arguing that Public Act 1 reduced the minimum wage for tipped workers and changed the way future inflation adjustments for minimum wage increases occurred in the future.
A notice from the board notes a suggested petition summary with explanatory materials is due on June 18. Canvassers plan to meet to discuss the summary on June 27. The deadline for the board to either approve or reject the summary is July 10.
The Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association squarely opposed the effort.
“PA 1 of 2025 represents that rare outcome voters hope for from their elected officials but rarely experience – a true bipartisan solution in the midst of a polarized environment,” said MRLA President and CEO Justin Winslow in a statement. “This particular diamond in the rough was crafted after extensive input from tens of thousands of Michigan servers, business owners, and community diners ultimately passed by both the Republican-led House and Democratic-led Senate, and signed by Governor Whitmer.”
Winslow called the effort misguided and said Voters to Stop Pay Cuts was just One Fair Wage under a new name. He said suspending Public Act 1 would do nothing but slow the pace toward a $15 minimum wage.
“After six years of legal uncertainty, our industry finally has clarity and a responsible path forward. Michigan’s restaurant workers and operators deserve certainty, not the chaos that would result from suspending thoughtful, bipartisan legislation,” Winslow said. “We urge voters to decline to sign this irresponsible attempt to undermine worker-focused legislation that reflects the voices of actual Michiganders, not out-of-state interests.”

In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, the U.S. Department of Labor is alleging that Rocio Correa-Mata, 33, of Iowa City, as the sole owner and primary manager of the Mexico Lindo Grill & Cantina restaurant chain, violated the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

The department alleges that certain servers at the restaurants were “only paid via direct cash and credit tips from customers” and did not receive the federal minimum wage rate of $7.25 per hour.
The chain also is alleged to have “willfully and repeatedly” paid employees less than the statutory overtime rate of 1.5 times the workers’ regular wages for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week.
In addition, the department claims Mexico Lindo paid its “back-of-the-house employees” – a term typically used to describe kitchen workers — a cash salary that was insufficient to compensate them for any overtime hours.
According to the lawsuit, Mexico Lindo then failed to create and preserve accurate records of employees’ hours and failed to document each worker’s full name and Social Security number.
The department alleges defendant Correa-Mata has actively managed and supervised Mexico Lindo’s operations and employees from June 2015 through the present, overseeing the chain’s daily operations, hiring and firing employees, establishing work schedules, and setting rates of pay at each location.
The Department of Labor is seeking a court order enjoining Correa-Mata and the chain from “continuing to withhold employees’ unpaid minimum wages and overtime compensation,” as well as an order finding them liable for any unpaid wages, plus an equal amount in liquidated damages, payable to 25 different employees of the three Mexico Lindo locations.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Correa-Mata at home or at any of the Mexico Lindo restaurants.

The time of death was 10:11 a.m.
Hanson, who also went by George John Hanson, was sentenced to death for the 1999 shooting death of Mary Bowles, 77, a retired bank executive whom he and his accomplice, Victor Miller, abducted from a Tulsa mall. Bowles was shot four to six times. Her body was later found in a dirt pit near Owasso.

“Today, justice was finally served for Mary Bowles and Jerald Thurman,” said Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. “After more than 25 years of waiting, the killer who brutally took these two precious lives has paid the ultimate price for his heinous crime. This case demonstrates that no matter how long it takes, Oklahoma will hold murderers accountable for their crimes.”
In May, the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board voted 3-2 to decline clemency.
His attorney, Callie Heller, told the board that Hanson was homeless, developmentally disabled and didn’t get a fair shot at presenting mitigating evidence.
Hanson was imprisoned in Louisiana for an unrelated crime before being transferred in March to Oklahoma so his execution could be carried out.

The plaintiffs, meanwhile, argue the Wyoming Republican Party “went rogue” when it sidelined them. 
The post State GOP asks court to toss disputed Hot Springs leadership election case appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming GOP has asked a Laramie County District Court judge to dismiss a lawsuit against the state party, arguing that the government should not meddle in a private organization’s internal matters. 
The dispute stems from the state party’s recommendation that county GOPs disregard state statute and a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling, and allow ousted committee precinct people to vote in local party elections. 
The Hot Springs County Republican Party initially ignored that advice, setting off a series of events that ultimately led to the ousting of two of the plaintiffs from their elected positions. As a result, four Hot Springs County Republican voters filed a complaint in April that accused the state party of interfering in their local GOP elections and asking the court to intervene. 
“Should this court accept plaintiffs’ invitation to commandeer the Wyoming Republican Party’s internal affairs,” the party argued in a May 20 filing, “the court would indeed be injected into an essentially political controversy and would be forced to assume the role of ‘kingmaker…without…clear, objective standards that might insulate from charges of political meddling.’”
The plaintiffs responded in their own filings, arguing that such an intervention is needed to uphold state law and to ensure that they are not prevented from participating in party business, such as voting on nominees in the event of a vacancy in one of Wyoming’s statewide elected offices. In the past few years, the party has selected nominees to fill vacancies for both superintendent of public instruction and secretary of state.
“The relief plaintiffs seek is to compel the state party to continue to comply with statutes that have been on the books for over 50 years and with which the state party in fact complied for over 50 years, until it went rogue,” the filing states. 
How we got here
The plaintiffs include Joe Martinez, Phillip Scheel, Meri Ann Dorman and Clay Van Antwerp, who were elected to chairman, state committeeman, secretary and vice chairman, respectively, at Hot Springs County GOP’s officer elections on March 17. 
After the meeting was adjourned, Cheryl Aguiar, former Hot Springs County GOP chair, filed a complaint with the state party. Aguiar disputed the validity of the county party’s elections since the ousted precinct people were not permitted to vote.

Soon after, the state party’s Dispute Resolution Committee ordered the Hot Springs County GOP to conduct a recount and allow ousted precinct committee people to cast ballots. Consequently, Martinez and Scheel’s victories were overturned. 
Both men attended the Wyoming Republican Party’s meeting in Cody in May, but stood at the sidelines as the party voted in new leadership. 
Necessary parties 
In its motion to dismiss, the state party also argues that by not naming the Hot Springs County GOP as a defendant, the plaintiffs failed to join a necessary party, and that alone is reason to dismiss the case. 
“In fact, plaintiffs’ entire complaint rests upon the foundation that plaintiff’s preferred candidates must be elected members of the Hot Springs Party and acknowledged as the same,” the filing states. 
“For this reason, the court must dismiss this matter unless and until [the] plaintiff joins all necessary parties.”
But even if that’s remedied, the state GOP says it will challenge the constitutionality of state law that regulates county political party elections. 
Response 
State law does not impose “undue burdens” on the party’s internal governance, the plaintiffs argue. 
“The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that states may enact reasonable regulations of political parties, election, and ballots to reduce disorder and ensure the integrity of democratic processes,” the filing states
As with previous filings in the case, the plaintiffs highlighted a 2023 Wyoming Supreme Court decision involving the Uinta County GOP and a party bylaw permitting ousted precinct committee members to vote in officer elections. Ultimately, the high court ruled that the bylaw “violated clear and unambiguous language” in state law. 
In its decision, “the Wyoming Supreme Court recognized the state’s interest in regulating political parties to ensure fair and orderly processes, even though it abstained from ruling on the constitutionality of [the state law],” the filing states. 
The plaintiffs also point to the GOP’s meeting in Cody, where they were sidelined, as a source of irreparable harm. In fact, they argue that the outcome of the race for state GOP vice chair would have turned out differently had Martinez and Scheel been permitted to vote. 
“Plaintiffs, had they been allowed to vote, would have voted for Virginia Bennett, the candidate who lost by one vote to Bob Ferguson,” the filing states, allegedly making Bennett the “rightful winner.” 
“The court should not reward the state party for its bad faith conduct. There is more irreparable harm on the horizon that the state party is ready, willing and able to inflict on the public,” the court document states. 
The case was filed in Laramie County District Court, where the state party is headquartered.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.


Births are expensive
The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.
“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
Ripple effects
Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
State action
Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

Harris told the committee on Thursday that a Lee County child suspected of having measles tested negative for the disease. (Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s state health officer said Thursday that a suspected measles case in Lee County turned out to be negative, meaning the state has not yet seen a confirmed case of the disease this year amid measles outbreaks around the nation. 
Dr. Scott Harris Thursday told the State Committee of Public Health, which oversees the Alabama Department of Public Health, that the suspected case was in a child just under 12 months old who was not yet eligible for the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The child had symptoms such as fever and rash, but tested negative on Wednesday.
“At this point, we don’t have our first measles case from this outbreak, that we know of anyway,” Harris said.

ADPH reported Sunday it was investigating a suspected case of measles. In March, the department investigated a possible measles exposure after an unvaccinated child who traveled through the state later tested positive for measles.
Alabama’s MMR vaccination rate among kindergartners was 93.8% in the 2023-2024 school year, under the 95% rate set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to achieve herd immunity.
Harris has said in each board meeting since the outbreaks started this year that a case in Alabama “is coming.” He said there could still be undetected cases, especially in areas with low vaccination rates, that can lead to an outbreak.
“If you have a case that reaches some population, for example, a day care, where kids aren’t old enough to be vaccinated yet. You could expose dozens of children at once,” Harris said after the board meeting.
An outbreak that started with two unvaccinated school-age children in west Texas in January has now spread to at least 33 other states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since the first outbreak this year, authorities have reported nearly 1,200 cases in people who are either unvaccinated or have unknown status. Of total cases, 12% have been hospitalized and three people have died.
The measles vaccine has significantly reduced severe illness and fatalities since it became available in 1973; previously, measles led to an estimated 48,000 hospitalizations and 400-500 deaths annually in the U.S. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, and one dose is 93% effective.
Through April, the MMR vaccination rate in Texas was up 450%, compared to its vaccination rate in 2019, according to The Texas Tribune. Since the outbreak, Texas health officials have made the vaccine, which is typically available to children ages one and older, available to infants older than six months. Health officials have also attributed the increased vaccine uptake to public awareness.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC05057.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503
