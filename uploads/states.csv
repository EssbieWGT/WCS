“Unfortunately this is not an isolated incident,” she said in a statement, adding that ICE agents are facing a surge in assaults against them.
On June 18, Omaha-based agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security Investigations led an operation to arrest Hurtado-Cariaco. An ICE spokeswoman said agents conducted a traffic stop and Hurtado-Cariaco allegedly launched an attack on a special agent. 
Hurtado-Cariaco allegedly “threw the ICE agent to the ground, slammed her head into the pavement, ripped off her body armor, and made repeated and physical violent contact,” said the Homeland Security statement.
He fled the scene, but federal agents apprehended him about an hour later in the same area.
The agent sustained injuries to her head and arm and was transported to the University of Nebraska Medical Center. She has since been released and is recovering. Hurtado-Cariaco also allegedly assaulted an FBI agent during the incident.
Federal officials said that Hurtado-Cariaco entered the U.S. illegally in 2023, and was removed by Border Patrol. It said that he re-entered illegally the following year and was released into the country with a notice to appear.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-21 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump has no queer pride,John D. Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/21/trump-has-no-queer-pride/,The message from the Trump administration: queer people are not welcomed in the United States.,"My husband and I traveled to Washington D.C. to attend World Pride 2025, which coincided with DC’s 50th anniversary of Capitol Pride the first weekend of June. It was in a word – amazing!
We loved being with so many queer people unanimous in being visible and challenging the unbridled homophobia and transphobia heaped on the queer community by the current president, his administration, and many of his followers. We were awed by the sheer number of people from around the world, partied, laughed, and felt rejuvenated by sharing this experience with so many of our queer brothers and sisters.
We were prepared to expect little support from the Trump administration for the anticipated three million visitors for World Pride, yet still surprised for just how petty were the slights directed at our community.
There was a total absence of any events involving anything federal. There were no governmental affinity groups in the parade, no events held on the National Mall or any of the city’s federal grounds, and a month of events had to be moved from the nation’s premiere performing arts halls – the Kennedy Center.
However, most troubling was the closing and mesh-fence barricading of Dupont Circle – ground zero for DC’s queer neighborhood which occurred just before the festival’s largest event, the Saturday, June 7 parade. The excuse conjured by the National Parks Service about protecting the fountain was typical nonsense from administrators who regale in being cruel. Make no mistake, this was done purely for spite.
If any of my queer brothers, sisters, and allies ever had a doubt that queer rights and progress were under attack, this picayune action on the day before the largest queer gathering anywhere in the world during 2025 was designed to send a message to LGBTQ+ people around the world. The message received from closing this sacred queer space was that queer people are not welcomed in the United States. Your community will be removed from social venues. Your rituals and celebrations will be denigrated. Your artistic achievements will be dismissed. Your history will be erased, and more.
During June Pride month and going forward while enduring this administration, this is a time for visibility. The way these slights and inordinate number of hateful laws being perpetrated against the LGBTQ+ community around the country and yes, even in queer-friendly Connecticut, can be countered through each queer person’s secret power – which is to come out.
Be open, yet safe, in the reveal. Attend high-visibility Pride parades and festivals. Write letters to elected officials and business leaders praising their support or condemning their cowardice. Donate to organizations on the front lines fighting against authoritarianism. Educate friends and family that queer people have always been part of the human experience.
The queer community, with its disparate constituencies, becomes more powerful by banding together and employing the power of our collective resources and talents to counteract discrimination. While it is tiresome having to continually deal with bullies, especially one with such power, the challenge facing the queer community is now a moment as significant as Stonewall – the very reason for June Pride. 
On this journey for full equality, Stonewall’s legacy still resonates that a good way to stop a bully is to fight back.

This week, however, the Omahan was picked up at his job of more than 20 years by Douglas County officials who told him he was wanted on a “hold” by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Valentine spent the next two nights in the county jail. On Friday, a day after his attorney sent the jail proof of his U.S. citizenship, he was released.
Valentine said he kept telling himself the ICE hold had to be a mistake, but at the same time he had a worrisome thought that he could wind up in a country he hadn’t stepped in for five decades. 
He had recently been convicted for a felony third-offense DUI, and he was approved for a house arrest with allowance to go to work.
“I was like, well, maybe something about the law changed,” Valentine said, recounting his thoughts while in jail. “I’ve been here for 49 years, I don’t know anything else. If they did deport me, I don’t even speak Spanish.”
 New fuel to enforcement tensions

While Valentine was let go from jail to resume a 60-day house arrest and three years probation for the non-immigration-related offense, the situation adds a different fuel to escalating tensions over ramped-up immigration enforcement in Nebraska and elsewhere.
“It never occurred to me that something like this could happen,” said his attorney Ashley Albertsen, who added that the ICE hold caused “unnecessary” distress and an interruption of Valentine’s job.
Family friend and Omaha criminal defense attorney Yvonne Sosa, who learned about Valentine’s immigration hold, said she found it scary. 
The Trump administration reportedly has demanded that ICE make 3,000 immigration-related arrests a day, and the president more recently directed ICE officers to “do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.”

Said Sosa: “I am used to a system where there are checks and balances and people are required to check and double check their work. It doesn’t seem like that is happening, and it is to the detriment of citizens — so I am scared.”
Sosa reflected on the recent circumstances of a Guatemalan worker at a west Omaha Early Bird restaurant. 
In that case, an immigration official reportedly told a TV station that agents had been looking for a Guatemalan national who had a final immigration order of removal and saw someone matching his description. 
The agents followed the man, who turned out not to be the original target but allegedly resisted arrest. A video of that man being handcuffed on the ground in front of patrons was widely circulated on social media, prompting new Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. to say: “That’s not the way we want to do law enforcement in Omaha, Nebraska.”
The Early Bird suspect, Romeo Edilzar Yaxcal-Tiul, has been charged in a federal indictment with three counts, including use of a Social Security number not assigned to him and resisting arrest.
 Reason for detainer unclear 

Of the Valentine situation, Albertsen and others wondered how law enforcement information got crossed up to the point that he was handcuffed at his worksite and left to spend two nights in jail not knowing more details. 
Valentine said he asked early on to speak to an immigration enforcement official and noted on a form he was asked to fill out that he was an American citizen.

“I never got to talk to anybody from ICE, and ICE never apologized,” he said.  
A Douglas County spokeswoman said ICE had contacted the county on Wednesday — the same day Valentine was picked up at his job —  requesting that a detainer be placed on him. 
ICE contacted Douglas County Corrections again the next evening, Thursday, requesting that the detainer be removed, the county spokeswoman said. Thursday was a federal holiday, Juneteenth. Valentine spent that night in jail.
A spokeswoman for ICE, responding to a request from the Examiner, said key people privy to information about the situation were not available Friday. It is unclear exactly why the ICE detainer was placed on Valentine. But the federal spokeswoman said it was based on “information gleaned from local law enforcement.” 
 Court records, interviews 

Here’s what happened leading up to that point, according to court records and interviews with Valentine and his father.
Valentine has struggled with an alcohol problem, he and his dad said. In August 2024, he was arrested for the third offense DUI. The first charge had come more than a decade ago, the more recent two came as Valentine pushed through a condition called psoriatic arthritis that Valentine said caused him pain to walk up stairs or tie his shoes. He now takes medication for the condition.
“But he loves to work,” said dad, Walt Valentine, who said his son “religiously” followed the court’s orders so that he could continue working pending his sentencing. 
In the months following the August arrest, Valentine’s attorney said he went to counseling, Alcoholics Anonymous and reported to county officials frequent breathalyzer results showing he was not drinking.
On Tuesday, June 17, following a “joint recommendation” by the prosecution and defense, Valentine was sentenced to three years of supervised probation that called for the first 60 days in jail, continued AA meetings, a seven-year revocation of a driver’s license and a fine. 
The day after being jailed, a judge signed off on an order approving house arrest for the 60 days and released him.
Valentine had lunch with his dad and reported to work that same afternoon, until he was called to a guard’s station. Valentine said he figured it was a routine check by work release officials and was surprised when the county corrections representatives told him he was wanted on an ”ICE hold.”
He said the men who summoned him from his work seemed apologetic. 
 Work flow disruption

Valentine’s dad said his wife, Linda, was more upset about what happened to their son than him. He said he figured it would get sorted out eventually and that their son, who lives with them, could not truly be an ICE target. He said he’s more troubled about friends and neighbors that have little to no recourse from deportation.
“Families are being broken up, people are skipping work and school because they are afraid,” said Walt Valentine.
At work, manager Mark Wright said Valentine’s apprehension caused a disruption, as he leads a crew of about eight in the shipping and receiving area of Skylark Meats. “He’s an important piece of our daily operations, everybody likes Domingo.”
Wright said the incident “strikes fear” in other people who are “rightfully here.”
For Domingo Valentine, he said he is looking forward to completing probation, working on his health and making up for two days of lost pay.
 “I do feel that if you have brown skin you might have to be a little more wary,” he said. “If this could happen to me, it could happen to almost anybody.”

John James (R- Shelby Township) promised increased security on the country’s northern border at a talk Friday in Detroit.
Noem claimed in the discussion panel, organized by the conservative group America’s Future Tour, that “many” transnational gang members are crossing into the country via the northern border after the southern border had experienced increased security since President Donald Trump took office. 
Noem warned conservative allies that undocumented immigrants could enter by land, sea or road border crossings like the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“When we seal secure areas where criminals may want to cross, they will find new areas,” Noem said. 
Noem said she had met with people across the country who are “seeing so many resources going to the southern border that they felt concerned we are forgetting about the northern border.” Noem claims Canada to be floundering on border security and allowing drug traffickers and human smugglers access to the U.S.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or  CBP, logs “encounters” in its system whenever it comes across an individual who is either not allowed to enter the U.S. or has crossed the border illegally at a location other than an official entry point. Illegal crossings at the US-Canada border make up less than 0.5% of the almost 3 million encounters reported nationwide according to CBP data. 
Undocumented migrants also commit far fewer crimes that American citizens, with peer-reviewed studies reporting that U.S.-born citizens are over two times more likely to be arrested for violent crimes and four times more likely to be arrested for property crime. 
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), a candidate for U.S. Senate, spoke Friday evening at a campaign event in Ferndale and told Michigan Advance that the Trump administration’s policies were nothing more than “security theater” and not truly enhancing the safety of the nation.
“They are going after anybody and everybody from kids to moms who are trying to immigrate the right way to a kid here in Michigan who was three credits away from graduation, in a way that is scaring anybody from wanting to come across the border,” McMorrow said. “It’s not actually any thoughtful or tactical plans to improve the border and security. It’s just whatever they can put on social media to generate clicks.”

The America’s Future Tour panel comes amid a backdrop of growing protests across the country against the Trump administration’s hardline approach to migration. The Los Angeles migrant rights protest, which saw journalists and protestors shot with rubber bullets and doused in tear gas, has become a flashpoint in the migration debate after the Trump administration deployed the National Guard. 
During Noem’s panel discussion, the LA Press Club and investigative news site Status Coup announced a lawsuit over what they allege to be the “targeting” of journalists by DHS during coverage of the LA protests.
The lawsuit accuses DHS officers of “unnecessarily and indiscriminately” using less-lethal ammunition against reporters, protesters and legal observers during the LA demonstrations. 
Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy, a noted Trump ally who was part of the panel, affirmed Noem’s claims.
“[T]he amount of stuff that is coming in, illegals and other stuff from the northern border, is just going to continue until we tighten things up there,” Murphy said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC_3635-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 22:58:05.372157

Wes Moore cited a number of reasons for vetoing a bill that would have created a reparations commission, but none of them hold up to scrutiny, writes Ronald Stubblefield, who said a reparations commission is still badly needed.","Protesters outside the State House rally on May 20 against Gov. Wes Moore's (D) veto of the Reparations Commission bill, and demanding legislators override it. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s recent veto of legislation that would have created a commission to study reparations was more than a routine exercise of political discretion. It was a failure of moral leadership.
As someone who has advised federal, state, and local agencies across the country in economic development, I recognize the complexities of governance. But leadership demands more than complexity management. It demands courage.
The proposed commission wouldn’t have authorized payments. It would have simply studied the long arc of economic exclusion and racial harm in Maryland — and explored policy responses grounded in that history. If we can study broadband, infrastructure, or water systems, we can certainly study the cumulative impact of slavery and state-sanctioned racism. Even if direct payment isn’t the outcome, justice requires we understand the full cost of the harm. The idea that even that step was too much to pursue is troubling.
Before we examine Gov. Moore’s rationale, we must clarify a deeper issue: Many of the racial equity initiatives currently prioritized by state and local governments are forward-looking — aimed at stopping future harm. But reparations are about addressing past harm. The legacy of slavery, forced breeding, Jim Crow segregation, housing discrimination, underfunded HBCUs and decades of police violence require targeted, historically grounded solutions.

Maryland’s history also includes the ongoing desecration of Black cemeteries, such as Moses African Cemetery, where community advocates continue to fight for dignity in death. A study commission is a basic and necessary first step in reckoning with this history.
Moore cited these main reasons for his veto:
Black representation. Moore suggested that strong Black leadership in government is itself progress. But representation is not redress. Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, referencing her own family’s role in Brown v. Board of Education, reminded us that symbolic milestones don’t erase structural injustice.
Duplication of equity efforts. Moore argued a commission would duplicate other equity initiatives. But studying reparations is not a distraction — it is a policy tool. We can and should applaud policies that expand opportunity. But we must also demand remedies that repair past harm. The two are not mutually exclusive — they are morally co-dependent.
Bad timing. Moore suggested the political climate wasn’t right. But leadership means shaping moments, not waiting for them. Cities like Evanston, Illinois, and states like California have shown the value of bold, principled action.
Policy substitutes. Moore pointed to his economic mobility, housing, and education policies. These are important, but they are not reparations. They don’t redress generational theft of Black wealth through redlining, displacement or the underfunding of HBCUs. Nor do they address the destruction of cultural assets like Black cemeteries or health disparities from underfunded hospitals. These initiatives look to the future. Reparations confront the past.
Past commissions. Moore cited previous commissions — like the Maryland Lynching Truth and Reconciliation Commission — as grounds to reject the new bill. But those commissions were limited in scope. They did not calculate cumulative economic harm or propose direct redress. The deep racial wealth disparities that persist today — such as the fact that the median Black household in Maryland holds just 12 cents of wealth for every dollar held by white households, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research — are not accidental. This wealth gap is not an abstract inequity; it is the measurable result of government-sanctioned dispossession, from slavery and redlining to exclusion from labor protections and unequal access to capital.
Reparations are not about closing general equity gaps — they are about confronting and repairing the specific harm caused by government policy over generations.
The Maryland General Assembly should reconsider this bill. Communities across the state deserve a formal, statewide commission with the authority and mandate to propose structural redress.
Moore’s rise is inseparable from the history he just sidelined. By vetoing the commission, he signaled that symbolic progress is enough. But real leadership confronts history — and builds a future from its lessons. We need leaders who choose transparency over optics and courage over convenience.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Reparations-rally-5-20-2025-1024x664.jpg,,,2025-06-20 22:58:05.372157

After a series of failed attempts to weaken and strengthen a proposed limit on assault-style weapons, a ban on sales and manufacturing — but not possession —  ultimately prevailed.
True to form, lawmakers found plenty more to debate and discuss over the marathon day that stretched late into the evening. 
As the sun went down, the temperature inside the airless second-floor chambers seemed to rise. On what was the first full day of summer, lawmakers quenched their thirst with Del’s frozen lemonade and an endless carousel of caffeinated beverages.

Senate softens state’s aim on assault weapons 
You can still own an assault-style weapon in Rhode Island, but you will have to cross state lines to buy or sell it. That’s the gist of the legislation approved by both chambers in an eleventh-hour rework aimed at appeasing at least some of its critics.
The rewrite was led by the Senate, which kicked off its marathon session with an hour-long debate, culminating in a 25-11 vote, to approve the bill banning the manufacture and sale of semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with military-style features beginning July 1, 2026. It does not address inheritance of these weapons.
“The expectation over time is the proliferation of assault-style weapons, as specified in the bill, will go down,” Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat and bill sponsor, said. “We need to get this done today.”
The Senate’s checkmate forced the House, which had already approved a more restrictive version that also banned possession, to reconsider. The lower chamber eventually caved to the Senate’s less stringent counterpart by a 43-28 vote just before 9:30 p.m.
The House’s vote came after a nearly two-hour break likely marked by behind-the-scenes negotiations, and an additional, five-minute recess for representatives to familiarize themselves with the Senate’s changes.
“This bill cuts off the supply of weapons of war for the long haul at the point of sale,” Rep. Jennifer Boylan, a Barrington Democrat and gun safety advocate, said.

Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, also backed the Senate version, despite its significant changes from the more sweeping ban he had successfully advanced through the House chamber already.
“The two bills in their effect on the ground are closer to each other than you think,” Knight said, noting that the difficulty in procuring a new assault-style weapon even in other states prevents expansion of the “universe” of such weapons in Rhode Island.
Yet, the compromise was met with some dissatisfaction from both sides. The Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence had denounced the “watering down” of what had been a much more sweeping ban on assault-style weapons. 
Sen. Pamela Lauria, a Barrington Democrat, sought to amend DiPalma’s bill to mirror the House version, despite the Senate Committee on Judiciary opting to hold the stronger option for further study on Wednesday. 
“As we look to pass critical legislation regarding assault weapons, we should have taken the opportunity to pass the best version of this bill,” Lauria said.
But after Senate Republicans, along with Ciccone, raised objections, Senate President Valarie Lawson ruled that Lauria was out of order.
Republicans, along with some conservative Democrats, and gun rights groups maintained that no ban at all was the answer. All four Senate Republicans, plus some conservative Democrats, voted against the ban on the manufacture and sale of assault-style weapons.

Across the rotunda, Cranston Rep. Charlene Lima, a conservative Democrat, also denounced the compromise bill for going too far. Her critiques were met with raucous applause from yellow T-shirt-wearing Second Amendment supporters seated in the gallery. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi issued a stern rebuke, noting the seriousness of the topic before them.
“We will not have interruptions,” Shekarchi told onlookers. “If there is another uproar, I will close the gallery and you can watch on TV.”
Despite the warning, gun rights advocates booed after the House passed the amended bill.
The final version drew support from Everytown for Gun Safety, which maintained the language still covers the majority of the assault-style weapons frequently used in mass shootings. The Rhode Island AFL-CIO, a strong supporter of Lawson, also backed the proposal in a statement Thursday pointing to the union’s February poll that found 64% of residents support “banning the sale and manufacture of military-style assault weapons” in the state. 
Gov. Dan McKee, who had posed the weapons ban as a budget issue earlier in the year, confirmed via social media he will sign the measure into law.
“I’m proud that Rhode Island took an important step forward in protecting our communities from gun violence,” he posted to X at 9:50 p.m.
Clearing the air in R.I.’s two casinos
Bally’s two Rhode Island casinos will be slightly less smoky starting in 2027 — 18 months later than its advocates wanted.
The delayed start combined with a second, late-in-the-session clawback prompted longtime advocate and sponsor Rep. Teresa Tanzi to withdraw her name from her own bill after the opposite chamber added a carveout for smoking bars within casinos. Tanzi was one of four Democratic representatives to vote against the bill she introduced, though it prevailed with 67 supporters in the House Friday.
Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, railed against the revised proposal, declaring it was “nothing like” her original, which had called for the smoking ban to start July 1, 2025, with no exceptions.
Rather than banning smoking in Bally’s Corp.’s Lincoln and Tiverton casinos altogether, the amended legislation adds an exemption for smoking lounges with a new, hazy definition, Tanzi argued.
“This does not prevent Bally’s from expanding cigarette smoking or cigar smoking or vaping or, I don’t know, cannabis,” Tanzi said. “It’s really not clear to me what this new definition is because there’s all of a sudden a brand-new definition about smoking lounges.”

Existing state law defines “smoking bars” as businesses where tobacco sales are greater than 50% of its total revenue. The amended version offers new meaning for a – “pari mutual facility smoking lounge,” defined as any kind of smoking bar with a “proper ventilation system” that will “prevent the migration of smoke to nonsmoking areas.”
In Tanzi’s interpretation, that means any walled-off section of the casino floors could remain a smokers’ paradise.
The Senate already approved the modified smoking ban under a unanimous vote Wednesday. Though Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski sponsored her chamber’s version, Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone brokered the compromised legislation after initially seeking to reach an agreement between Bally’s and union leaders to expand existing nonsmoking areas at the Lincoln facility. 
Bally’s Corp. officials had opposed the proposed smoking ban, citing a potential annual revenue loss of $30 million to $60 million. Company spokesperson Patti Doyle thanked legislators for the compromise.
“Confining smoking to an existing smoking lounge at our Lincoln venue and allowing for a delayed transition away from smoking on the gaming floor will hopefully mitigate a portion of that anticipated revenue loss to the state,” Doyle said in a statement late Friday.
Union workers who for years have decried the health consequences of smoke-filled working conditions reluctantly agreed to the compromise version as “the best we could get,” Tanzi said Friday. However, the union wants to revisit the topic when lawmakers reconvene, either in a possible fall session in October or when it starts its next regular session in January, Tanzi said.
“I had a lot more faith in our legislators,” Vanessa Baker, an iGaming manager at Bally’s Twin River Casino in Lincoln, said in a phone interview Friday. “I thought they thought we were people.”
15th time’s a charm on payday lending reform
Cracking down on predatory payday lending practices drew strong support in the Rhode Island Senate Friday. The 27-6 vote came swiftly and with little debate — a stark contrast to the 15-year battle to move the legislation out of committee to the chamber for a vote.
Having already passed in the House with unanimous support Monday, the Senate’s endorsement sets the stage for the long-awaited end to triple digit interest rates on short-term, small-dollar loans — though not as soon as some advocates had hoped. A last-minute revision delayed the start date till January 2027 in an effort to give time to the “deferred deposit providers” like Advance America to wind down operations, and for their employees to find new jobs.
Under existing law, these storefront lenders had been able to take advantage of a loophole in state law to charge an annual percentage rate up to 360%. The legislation caps the annual interest and fees at no more than 36%, mirroring policies already adopted by 22 states and the federal government.
Kicking the can on a bottle bill
Rather than start prescribing specifics of a deposit-refund program for recyclable bottles, glasses and cans, both chambers approved a modified bottle bill Friday that advances only a small component of the original calling for yet another study of the policy. 
The 53-11 and 36-0 votes in the House and Senate, respectively, came with reluctant support from Democratic backers who blamed opposing retailers and beverage manufacturers for mounting a misinformation-laden opposition campaign.
“There is still a great deal of conflicting data as to the implementation of best practices to address the problems of improving and disposing of our recyclable products, as well as enhancing our anti-littering efforts,” Shekarchi said in a statement earlier this week.
Rep. Carol McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat and bill sponsor, also expressed disappointment, stating outright that the watered-down version is not a bottle bill at all, calling just for a series of studies.
Instead, the legislation calls for a “statewide implementation analysis” to be conducted by a third-party consultant hired by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The study would now be due no later than Dec. 1, 2026, with an interim status report due April 1, 2026. The state-hired consultant would consider the conclusions drawn by an 18-month legislative study commission, and the original bottle bills.
McEntee, who co-chaired the prior study commission, has already indicated she’s planning to introduce a full-fledged bottle bill again next session, even though the state analysis will not be finished yet.
CRMC membership changes on the horizon
Change is coming to the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council, though not the sweeping reform advocates wanted. Rather than abolishing the politically appointed council and reshaping the agency as an administrative authority, lawmakers in both chambers narrowly agreed to a more modest update.
The bills, approved by 49-19 and 25-10 votes in the House and Senate, respectively, Friday, reduce the size of the council from 10 to seven members, simultaneously shrinking the quorum requirement in a nod to the vacancy issues that have plagued the existing panel. And it adds new professional qualifications for the powerful coastal regulatory body, specifically requiring an engineer, a coastal biologist and an environmental organization representative to sit on the new council. 
The existing council does not have any expertise requirements, though members must represent a variety of municipalities based on size and coastal proximity.
How fast the refresh occurs depends largely on how fast new candidates can be found; the legislation calls for Gov. Dan McKee to name six appointees (the seventh is designated as a DEM representative) no later than March 1, 2026. But the bill also says existing members can continue to serve until their replacements are named.
Progressive Democrats and Republicans joined in opposition, with the former insisting the membership changes fell too far short of more comprehensive reforms needed.
Legislators reprimand McKee with anti-bid rigging bill
McKee just can’t seem to escape the stain left by a 2021 state education contract scandal, with an anti bid-rigging bill included on the legislature’s final calendar of the session.
The Rhode Island Senate’s unanimous approval Friday, following passage in the House two days prior, aims to close a loophole in state procurement law by expressly forbidding public officials and administrators from intentionally interfering with the process by which the state awards competitive contracts to outside vendors. 
The need for specificity was laid bare by an investigation by Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office and Rhode Island State Police into a state education contract awarded to the ILO Group. State investigators ultimately found insufficient evidence to charge McKee for steering the $5.2 million school reopening contract to one of his former adviser’s friends — in part because there was nothing in state law saying that he could not.
The newly approved legislation, however, imposes strict penalties on state officials and vendors who participate in future collusion or bid-rigging activities: a felony charge punishable by up to three years in prison and a $1 million fine (or three times the value of the contract, whichever is greater). Vendors found to have participated in bid-rigging or steering activities are also no longer able to perform work for the state for up to five years.
McKee still needs to sign the legislation for it to become law — uncertain given documented attempts by his aides to dismantle the bill earlier in the session. McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment later Friday.
Opposition couldn’t break levy bill
The General Assembly OK’d Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s request to exceed the state’s annual 4% tax levy cap, clearing the way for a 7.5% increase in the amount of property taxes the city can collect in fiscal year 2026.
Providence Democrats Rep. Rebecca Kislak and Sen. Sam Zurier introduced the bound-to-be unpopular bill in their respective chambers. 
The House was the first to grant the city’s wish, passing Kislak’s bill in a 56-17 vote on May 27. The Senate passed Zurier’s version 30-7 on Wednesday. On Friday night, each chamber voted to concur with the other’s version of the bill, finalizing its passage out of the State House and toward McKee’s desk.
In the House, Zurier’s bill passed 57-14, with opposition from all 10 Republicans plus four Democrats, including Providence Reps. Enrique Sanchez and David Morales. In the Senate, Kislak’s bill passed 27-7, with Providence Democratic Sens. Sam Bell, Tiara Mack and Ana Quezada expressing disapproval similar to their House colleagues.
The extra revenue from the tweaked levy cap is meant to help resolve a budget shortfall introduced last November by a $15 million settlement between the city and the state’s education department over Providence’s public schools. The mayor, with the Providence City Council’s somewhat reluctant approval, has been counting on the levy measure as the critical piece in the city’s fiscal 2026 budget. While the mayor’s budget technically lowers property tax rates, new property valuations mean many homeowners will still see higher tax bills.   
WPRI-12 reported Wednesday that Smiley has asked McKee to sign the legislation as soon as it arrives on his desk. But even with the General Assembly’s blessing, it’s not clear if the added tax revenue will arrive in time to shore up the city’s fiscal 2026 budget, Smiley told the news station. 
Kratom clears Senate
For the second year in a row, a bill to regulate the psychoactive drug known as kratom arrived at the final night of the legislative session. Unlike last year, when the bill provoked a fierce debate in the Senate, it sailed through the chamber with a 22-9 vote.
The House version encountered more vigorous resistance when it went up for a floor vote on May 29. It passed 40-24, with a mix of Republicans, Democrats and one independent lawmaker decrying easier access to the plant-derived drug, which can be used as an opioid substitute or a stimulant.  
The bill was sponsored by Rep. Brian Patrick Kennedy, a Westerly Democrat, and Sen. Hanna Gallo, a Cranston Democrat, with the intent of bringing kratom — a product already available in gray markets like gas stations or head shops — into the sphere of regulation and taxation. This year’s bill is 25 pages, compared to last year’s six, and it would mandate strict labeling, testing, and age restrictions around kratom commerce, as well as limitations on what products could be sold mixed with kratom.
Last year,McKee vetoed the legislation — an outcome sponsors tried to avoid this year by working with the governor and the state health department to craft a more agreeable bill.

(Courtesy of U.S. Navy, Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Janweb B. Lagazo)LINCOLN —  As President Donald Trump decides whether the U.S. will play a larger role in the decades-long conflict between Israel and Iran, the Nebraska federal delegation says it will support whatever the president decides. 
Israel launched an attack last week with aerial attacks in Iran’s capital targeting its nuclear and military infrastructure. Since then, Israel and Iran have continued to exchange bomb strikes with no end in sight. 
Israel has asked the Trump administration to broaden U.S. involvement in the war to eliminate Iran’s nuclear program. The Nebraska federal delegation says they support Trump’s handling of the conflict and that Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon, though there’s no public evidence that Iran is currently building one. U.S. intelligence officials have said Iran could shift toward producing a nuclear weapon.
Unlike other federal lawmakers and some prominent populist pundits, the delegation hasn’t joined in the Republican rift between isolationists and the more hawkish wings of the Trump coalition. 
Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District Rep. Don Bacon hinted at a preference as he told the Nebraska Examiner, “It is preferable for us to stay out of the offensive operations over Iran and reduce risk of escalation.” 
Bacon said it depends on whether Iran stops its “nuclear weapons program” and whether Israeli forces can destroy the country’s nuclear facilities on their own. 
The reason Israeli officials are lobbying for more U.S. involvement is because only the U.S. has the military capacity to destroy more of Iran’s nuclear program with its 30,000-pound bombs – often referred to as “bunker busters.” 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that his country has the capability to achieve its goals alone.
“We may have no other choice than to finish the job,” Bacon said. “A nuclear-armed Iran is a dire threat to America and our allies.”
After days of speculation and conflicting reporting, White House’s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump would decide over the next two weeks whether the U.S. will strike Iran. Leavitt also told reporters that Iran “has never been closer to a nuclear weapon.” 
“Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon … All they need is a decision from the supreme leader to do that, and it would take a couple of weeks to complete the production of that weapon,” Leavitt said. 
In March, the U.S. intelligence community said Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, according to the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Trump dismissed her comments this week, saying he doesn’t “care what she thinks” and believes Iran is “very close to having one.” 
U.S. Rep Mike Flood, R-Neb., who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st District, said he supports Trump on this “significant decision,” because he has access to intel that could help inform America’s strategy in the conflict. 
“We must ensure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon,” Flood said. 
U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, who represents Nebraska’s largely rural 3rd District, said, “If Iran’s nuclear ambitions were realized, it would be catastrophic for both Israel and the United States.” 
Because of recent developments in the conflict, U.S. intelligence officials have said Iran could shift toward producing a nuclear weapon if the U.S. attacked its central nuclear facility or if Israel killed the nation’s supreme leader. But it would take months, not days — as Israel’s intelligence claims — to make a weapon. 
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts told Fox News earlier this week that Trump would “absolutely” have his support to use military action if negotiations failed. 
Ricketts also told reporters Wednesday that the decision should be Trump’s. 
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer said the U.S. “must continue to stand strong with Israel as [it works] to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.”
Even Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen released a video on social media emphasizing that “it is imperative for global peace that Iran never possesses a nuclear weapon,” and he had to cancel a scheduled trip to Israel because of the renewed conflict. 
The possible threat of an autocrat having access to a weapon of mass destruction could lead to the widening of another foreign war, like the precursor to the invasion of Iraq over two decades ago. The newly established two-week timeline from the White House gives more time for diplomacy as Europe makes a late push to de-escalate the conflict.



Statements from the Nebraska delegation 
“I fully support our defensive operations helping Israelis shoot down Iranian missiles and drones. I also support Israel’s actions to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons that would threaten all of us. It is preferable for us to stay out of the offensive operations over Iran and reduce risk of escalation. But if it turns out that only our bunker-busting bombs can destroy the deep underground nuclear facilities and that Iran refuses to stop its nuclear weapons program, then we may have no other choice then to finish the job. A nuclear-armed Iran is a dire threat to America and our allies.” – U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.
“We must be clear-eyed about the threat posed by Iran and adversaries globally and on the home front … I am grateful President Trump and negotiators from his administration have been robustly engaged in neutralizing Iran’s nuclear program and Iran’s funding for its allied enemies of Israel. If Iran’s nuclear ambitions were realized, it would be catastrophic for both Israel and the United States, who their leaders have sworn to destroy.” – U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., from a recent column
“I support President Trump as he weighs this significant decision. He has access to intel that will help inform America’s strategy — we must ensure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.” — U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb.
“As President Trump weighs all options on the table, we must continue to stand strong with Israel as they work to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.” — U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.
“We cannot allow Iran to have an enrichment program or to be able to get a nuclear bomb and Iran was just using the same old tactics of delaying the peace talks,” — U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb.

(Video screenshot)Members of the House Judiciary Committee held an unusual summer hearing on Friday to investigate the conduct of the Alaska Department of Corrections and the state’s decision to take temporary custody of more than 40 immigrant detainees formerly housed in Washington state.
Protests have taken place almost daily outside the Anchorage Correctional Center, which is holding the detainees. 
During a two-hour committee meeting, legislators asked tough questions of Jen Winkelman, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Corrections.
“It’s a very unique situation,” Winkelman said.
She said the federal detention center in Tacoma, Washington, is “bursting at the seams” and that a local Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent asked if the Anchorage Correctional Center was available.
“We looked at our … current population and said yes in an effort to be a good partner,” she said.
Since the inauguration of President Donald Trump and the start of his second term in office, the number of people being detained by ICE has surged.
The number of people detained for non-criminal reasons has grown even faster than the rate of detentions overall: Before Trump took office, about 1 in 16 ICE detainees had no criminal charges or convictions. Now, the ratio is 1 in 4. 
ICE has used aggressive and at-times violent tactics to make arrests, which has sparked protests against the agency.
The surge has also caused ICE to look across the country for available prison space, and the agency has turned to for-profit prisons and other unusual places.
Alaska does not have a federal prison, and the state has no for-profit prisons, but it does have long-standing contracts with federal agencies.
Traditionally, those contracts have resulted in the state temporarily housing federal inmates until they can be moved to federal facilities outside the state. 
But in June, the state’s contract with ICE worked almost in reverse, as 41 people were brought from the federal detention facility in Tacoma to the Anchorage Correctional Complex.
The problem, said Cindy Woods, senior immigration law and policy fellow for the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska, is that the state is now housing noncriminals in a facility designed to house criminals.
“What we have here in Alaska is we’ve got a state corrections facility. It’s very different circumstances, and it sounds like that’s not meeting the needs of the folks that are here in our care,” Woods said in front of the judiciary committee on Friday. 
“In addition to that, Alaska’s far away, and when you’re moving folks, especially when you’re moving folks at the last minute, with no notice, they’re losing access to their representation, their social services, their family, and other resources that they have. This is very concerning, and I think that we really need to rethink how we’re treating folks and the contracts and responsibilities of DOC,” she said.
In response to questions from legislators, Winkelman said that the state’s contract with the federal government means that Alaska’s costs are being reimbursed by the federal government.
“I’m just wondering if, all we’re doing is getting refunded for our costs, why are we doing this at all?” asked Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage.
Winkelman responded that it’s because Alaska doesn’t have a federal detention center but has a large federal presence — the Coast Guard, Army, Air Force and more.
“Until it is changed in statute, we will continue to be a good partner federally,” Winkelman said. “One of those partners is ICE, and I will say that typically, they do not stay.”
In response to a followup question from Josephson, Winkelman said that the state could have turned down the ICE request. 
She said that when the first ICE detainees arrived in Alaska, the department was told that they would be there for no more than 30 days. Since then, six of the original 41 detainees have left the state.
Attorneys for some of the detainees testified that their clients have told them about inadequate conditions and prison guards’ use of pepper spray to put the detainees back into their cells during a lockdown.
“There has been one use of force, and that was not at an individual,” Winkleman said. “We had an incident in the unit where they were … doing, essentially, a verbal demonstration, aggressively. They were not wanting to lock down.”
Woods said the detainees are being held in “punitive conditions.”
“These civil detainees at ACC are brothers, husbands, partners and fathers, who are simply waiting for an administrative body to decide their ability to stay in the United States,” she said.
In some cases, detainees are being kept three to a cell. That’s by detainees’ request, Winkelman said. Some would prefer to stay with people who speak their language and share their culture, she said.
Democratic and independent members of the House Judiciary Committee participated in Friday’s hearing, but none of the committee’s Republican members did so.
At least one Republican lawmaker, Rep. Julie Coulombe, R-Anchorage, watched the hearing from the gallery. Coulombe is not a member of the judiciary committee.
House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage and a member of the committee, issued a written statement calling Friday’s meeting a “show hearing” and saying that the House’s minority caucus “stands with the President.” 
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer and a member of the committee, also commented in the statement.
“This caucus stands with ICE, with Alaska’s Department of Corrections, and with every Alaskan who believes the rule of law still matters,” Vance said.

(Screengrab couretsy Department of Human Services)The Maryland Department of Human Services is giving control of its online state-benefits platform over to the state Department of Information Technology —along with $124.3 million to cover costs of the transfer.
The shift was approved at last week’s Board of Public Works meeting for the Maryland Total Human-services Integrated Network — known as MD THINK. The program allows state agencies to administer benefits such as Medicare, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and allows recipients better control over their services.
The change of program oversight better aligns with each departments’ responsibilities, DoIT Secretary Katie Savage said recently.
“As a technology organization, we’re best positioned to make decisions about how to manage and operate the health of the platform,” Savage said.

DHS currently operates the system. With the change, it will still have responsibility for the services that use the platform, but DoIT will operate underlying technologies, Savage said.
The system serves more than 2 million Marylanders, Savage said. Because of its size, the money coming from DHS will go toward cloud services, software and people to administer the platform, she said. 
“The employees won’t experience any real change in their day-to-day, except that they’ll be employees of DoIT instead of the Department of Human services,” Savage said.
The transition will create minimal change on the user-facing side of the platform, and it will affect 43 employees and 450 state contractors, she said.
After this transition year, funds to operate the program will be budgeted directly to DoIT, according to the Board of Public Works, which approved the shift without discussion at its June 11 meeting.
“We’re really excited about this move,” Savage said. “We think it’s important that a technology platform of this size be managed by the Department of Information Technology, which allows the Department of Human Services to focus on the applications and the actual administration of benefits.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-20-at-9.02.46 PM.png,,,2025-06-20 22:01:07.526272

(Photo Katelyn Smith/National Park Service)On Jan. 23, 2018, I woke to the biggest earthquake I had felt in my 30 years in Alaska. A few minutes later, my cellphone started buzzing. A tsunami alert had been issued. We immediately turned on KTOO, our local NPR station. We decided to drive to one of two recommended high points in our low-lying town along Icy Strait, off the Gulf of Alaska. On the radio, a local DJ came on and kept us informed. We went home when he said the warning had been rescinded.
Our area has a 90% chance of a damaging earthquake in the next 100 years. In our town, we probably won’t have electricity right after a major earthquake. Therefore, no internet or cell service. But in a vehicle, we can pick up NPR implementing the Emergency Broadcast Network, perhaps as we’re heading to high ground or going to check on our neighbors.
In other communities, the danger could be fast-moving wildfire. Or landslides.
Commercial radio may be helpful down south, but rural Alaska is different. Pick any rural Alaskan community with exposure to these dangers. You will find they probably don’t have a commercial radio station. They probably do receive an NPR station.
In rural Alaska, there is no market-driven solution to ensure emergency broadcasts happen in a disaster that recurs on a 100-year time scale. The Alaska delegation should protect funding for public broadcasting.

Tremayne Wilson was charged in 2021 and convicted by a jury after pulling out in front of an Anchorage Police Department vehicle and driving away at a high speed. During his arrest, Wilson did not cooperate with police.
After his conviction, Wilson appealed his case and represented himself in court. 
The ruling was what’s known as a “memorandum opinion,” which does not create new legal precedent but can reinforce existing precedent. 
In Wilson’s case, the court — citing prior precedent — concluded that Wilson’s failure to submit to police did not amount to resisting arrest.
In 2007, the Court of Appeals concluded that if someone in Alaska “turns turtle” and announces that they will not go with police, that action should not be considered resisting arrest. 
“Turtling” amounts to orienting the body so that a person’s arms and legs are underneath them, making it more difficult for police to handcuff the person.
“Mere non-submission does not qualify as ‘force’ for purposes of this offense,” the appeals court wrote about Wilson, referring to the state’s resisting-arrest law.
That conclusion followed an admission by Anchorage prosecutors who conceded that “the evidence at trial was legally insufficient to prove that Wilson used force to resist arrest.”
The appeals court, citing video evidence, did uphold Wilson’s conviction for failing to stop his vehicle at the direction of police.

(Photo courtesy of Washington state Democratic Party)Washington state Democratic Party chair Shasti Conrad won a coveted leadership post with the Democratic National Committee on Friday. 
Conrad was elected DNC vice chair, giving her a voice in crafting the party’s strategy for responding to the Trump administration and recapturing control of Congress in 2026.
She beat Kalyn Free, a national committee member from Oklahoma, in a run-off after neither garnered a majority in a first round of balloting earlier this week. That initial round featured a third candidate, Jeanna Repass, chair of the Kansas Democratic Party. 
Conrad, 40, said in a statement that she was “deeply grateful” for the result, which came after six days of voting.
“This was the longest election in DNC history, and every vote cast reflected our shared belief in building a stronger, more inclusive Democratic Party,” she said.
The party is looking to bounce back after a disastrous 2024 cycle. Conrad has argued that Democrats don’t need to drastically change their message or positions and instead must improve how they communicate with voters. 
She has also argued that the platform that has brought Democrats success in Washington, where the party controls all statewide elected offices and the Legislature, can be replicated to rack up victories elsewhere.
“We are not just strategizing to win elections. We are working to transform lives,” Conrad said before results came out.
The DNC chose two vice chairs over the past two weeks in a do-over of Feb. 1 elections that were won by Malcolm Kenyatta and David Hogg.
Those contests were invalidated after Free filed a complaint contending the party failed to follow its own rules on gender parity in officer elections. DNC members agreed to rerun elections for those seats. Only candidates who made it to the final round of voting in February and were eligible for each seat under party rules, could compete.
Hogg, a 25-year-old gun-control activist, declined to run for his seat. He faced criticism from fellow Democrats because of his plans to fund challenges to Democratic incumbents with his group, Leaders We Deserve.
Hogg’s exit left Kenyatta, a Pennsylvania state representative, as the only eligible candidate in the election for the vice chair position that had to be filled by a male under the DNC rules. Kenyatta was elected Saturday.
Conrad, 40, is in her second term as leader of Washington’s Democratic Party and is the first South Asian woman to lead a state party. 
She had the backing of DNC Chair Ken Martin, who appointed her in March to be an associate chair for the national party. In this role, she said she’s strived to spotlight issues of importance to Asian Americans and to work with influencers on ways to better engage younger voters.
“As a millennial, I’m committed to creating more opportunities for young people to get involved and become the leaders of today—not just tomorrow,” she said. She added that she’d ensure Asian American and Pacific Islanders “have a seat at every table where decisions are made.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shasti-Socials-Headshot.png,,,2025-06-20 20:01:42.384860

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaskans understand how much energy matters. It’s not just about turning on the lights or plugging in a phone, it’s about staying warm through the long, dark winters. It’s about making sure a remote community hundreds of miles from the road system has access to affordable, reliable power. And it’s about keeping the cost of living from climbing even higher.
That’s why Alaskans can be thankful to our senators for standing up for something that may sound technical — federal clean energy tax credits — but in reality, makes a world of difference to real people, right here in our state. Both our senators should keep up the good work.
Clean energy tax credits like the ones passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act have enabled Alaskan households, businesses and communities to strengthen their energy efficiency while getting major clean energy projects off the ground in Alaska, creating and protecting good union jobs in the process. Without these energy tax credits, we risk seeing economy-growing projects stalled or canceled, jobs lost and energy costs pushed even higher for Alaskan families already feeling the pinch.
The Alaska AFL-CIO represents 50,000 workers in 50 local affiliates across the state. These are hardworking men and women who build and maintain the critical infrastructure that keeps Alaska running. These are the skilled electricians, laborers, teamsters and tradespeople who have powered our oil and gas industry, and who are now also ready and trained to build the next generation of energy, including wind, solar, hydropower and more. They take pride in what they do, and they deserve the chance to keep working, supporting their families and strengthening their communities.
Many Alaska workers have spent months out on remote job sites, away from their families, helping install wind turbines or repair transmission lines. They are not just doing a job, they’re building a future for their children and for Alaska. And they know, like I do, that the sooner we get more local, affordable energy online, the better it will be for everyone — whether you live in Anchorage or Aniak.
But these projects don’t just happen on their own. They take time. They take investment. And in Alaska, where the terrain is tough and the permitting process can stretch for years, they take strong policy support. The Inflation Reduction Act’s federal renewable energy tax credits have been critical for getting projects to the finish line. Take them away, and we’re back to square one with projects delayed, jobs lost and energy bills creeping up.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski said it well in her letter to Senate leadership earlier this year: Eliminating these credits would disrupt progress and hurt American workers. She’s absolutely right. Here in Alaska, it’s not just about policy, it’s about people. And our people are ready to work. Our unions have already trained workers to build these projects. They’re just waiting on the green light to get going.
We may not always agree with our elected leaders on every issue, but when it comes to energy, we share common ground: We all want a future that’s affordable, reliable and built right here at home. That’s what these tax credits help make possible.
The Alaska AFL-CIO is proud to support an “all of the above” energy approach that includes oil, gas and clean energy resources. We believe in building it all, as long as it creates good union jobs and keeps Alaskans warm, working and thriving.
Let’s keep moving forward. Let’s keep building. And let’s make sure the next generation of energy in Alaska is one we can all be proud of — union-built, Alaskan-made, and here to stay. Sens. Murkowski and Dan Sullivan can help make that possible by protecting the clean energy tax credits that are helping to make this kind of growth possible.
Joelle Hall is the president of the Alaska AFL-CIO.

Greg Gianforte vetoed a bill that would have made child care workers eligible for the Best Beginnings Child Care Scholarship for their own children, arguing Montana has other tools to address the shortage.
But sponsor and Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, said House Bill 456 offered a unique and “proven strategy” for helping to make child care more affordable and accessible.
Best Beginnings leverages federal money to help lower income, working families or parents in school to afford child care, mostly by funding providers.
HB 456 aimed to fix a conundrum in the industry — that child care workers earn wages too low to afford their own child care, but a family with a child care worker might earn too much to qualify for Best Beginnings.
In his veto letter, Gianforte said Montana already has made great strides toward increasing quality and affordable child care.
In House Bill 648 from 2023, he said, the state provided Best Beginnings with $7 million to increase access, permanently expanding income eligibility from 150% to 185% of the federal poverty level.
He also said Montana has “eliminated unnecessary red tape that burdened childcare providers across our state.”
But Gianforte said HB 456 was costly and unfair.
He said it further expanded eligibility to include child care workers with a household income of less than two times the state median income, “essentially providing a benefit to one worker to the exclusion of others.
“The bill’s expanded eligibility is projected to cost Montana taxpayers more than $21 million over the next four years,” Gianforte said.
Gianforte, a Republican, said he shares the sponsor’s aim to support “the workforce behind the workforce,” but he pointed to a separate bill, House Bill 924, as offering a tool to address the childcare shortage and “innovate the industry.”
Karlen said Friday the Best Beginnings bill had offered a strategy to recruit and retain childcare workers that was shown to be successful, and it made childcare more affordable and accessible.
In testimony during the session, Karlen had said a pilot program in Montana that granted child care workers scholarships demonstrated a 20% decrease in turnover.
In a statement Friday, he said he said he’ll continue to work to improve the industry.
“I’m disappointed in the governor’s decision to veto this bipartisan, fiscally responsible bill — and frustrated on behalf of my constituents who are struggling to afford childcare, the dedicated childcare workers who continue to earn low wages, and the Montana businesses facing serious challenges finding employees due to our state’s ongoing childcare crisis,” Karlen said.
“But this veto isn’t the end. Legislators on both sides of the aisle have made it clear they’re ready to act to make childcare more affordable, and I’ll continue to do everything I can to work with the governor to ensure every child in Montana has access to high-quality early learning opportunities.”
In a phone call, Karlen said he also supports and was a co-sponsor of House Bill 924, but the bills had different aims.
Karlen said HB 456 offered a proven method to stabilize the industry.
On the other hand, he said HB 924, to create a new, multipurpose trust fund, presents opportunities to be innovative in, for example, how to help rural areas address unique challenges with early child care, or to create a pilot program in a high cost area.
Karlen said he feels positive about HB 924 and characterized it as a way to “think two steps ahead” about what Montana might need. However, as designed, he said, a board will consider new ideas for child care through the mega trust, but support for Best Beginnings isn’t guaranteed.
He also said even adding the cost of HB 456 and HB 924 together still doesn’t come close to the cost of income tax cuts in Montana, and it’s “a little bit disingenuous to act like this is a budget breaker.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/child-care2-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 20:01:42.384860

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Arturo Gamboa, a 24-year-old man who was arrested after a chaotic shooting at the “No Kings” protest in Salt Lake City on Saturday, has been released from jail. 
Third District Court Judge James Blanch signed an order on Friday directing Gamboa to be released from the Salt Lake County Jail, where he’s been held since Saturday night, with conditions agreed to through his attorney, Greg Skordas. 
Those conditions, according to the order, are that Gamboa “maintain residence” with his father and provide address and contact information to Utah Pretrial Services officials, that he not possess any firearms, that he turn in his passport to his attorney, and follow certain other conditions with pretrial services officials, who provide supervision for defendants. That includes staying in touch with his lawyer and calling a recorded line once a day. 
“We’re happy to have this behind us,” Skordas said in a text to Utah News Dispatch on Friday. “He should have never been in jail in the first place. We firmly believe Arturo committed no crimes.”

According to Salt Lake City police, the shooting during the protest happened after two men described as “peacekeepers” confronted Gamboa, who was openly carrying an AR-15 style rifle. One of the men, reportedly part of the event’s volunteer security team, fired three shots from a handgun, grazing Gamboa but also hitting an “innocent bystander,” Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, who was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
Shortly after the shooting, police arrested Gamboa, and he was booked into jail for investigation of murder. Police say, however, that Gamboa did not fire his rifle. The two “peacekeepers,” who wore high-visability vests, were initially detained by police, but were released after being questioned. Police said the man who fired the three shots is cooperating with investigators. 
As of Friday, Salt Lake County prosecutors had not filed charges against Gamboa or anyone else involved in the shooting. 
Skordas said the rifle Gamboa was carrying during the protest was not loaded. 
“All of the evidence confirms that he was lawfully and openly carrying an unloaded firearm on a public road,” Skordas said. “He never brandished it, never fired it and never pointed it in the direction of anyone. He was shot in the back by a person who needlessly shot two innocent men, killing one.”
According to an affidavit of probable cause for Gamboa’s arrest, one of the “peacekeepers” told police he saw Gamboa “move away from the main crowd into a secluded area behind a wall.” There, he told officers he observed Gamboa take out an AR-15 style rifle from his backpack and begin to “manipulate it.” Then they “called out to him to drop the gun after drawing their own firearms,” according to the affidavit. 
“(Gamboa) then lifted the rifle, and according to witnesses he began to run toward the large crowd gathered on State Street holding the rifle in a firing position,” the affidavit says. That’s when one of the “peacekeepers” fired three rounds at Gamboa. One of the bullets hit Ah Loo, “causing a fatal wound.” 
But in the days since Gamboa’s arrest, videos have circulated online raising questions about whether Gamboa had actually raised the rifle in a firing position and charged the crowd, as the “peacekeeper” told police. One angle, reported by FOX 13, showed Gamboa with his rifle aimed down and not running until after one of the security volunteers started shooting.

The order to release Gamboa came after the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office’s homicide team conducted a preliminary review of evidence on Friday. After that review, “it was determined that we will not be able to make an informed decision” by their deadline on Monday “as to the culpability, if any” of Gamboa in relation to the shooting Saturday, the District Attorney’s Office said in a news release. 
“The investigation will continue to be carried out by the Salt Lake City Police Department,” the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office said. “The Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office will continue to review as additional evidence is presented to us.”
The Salt Lake City Police Department issued a statement Friday saying its homicide squad “presented their initial findings from the ongoing investigation” into the shooting to the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office for legal review. 
“This process, known as a case screening, is a key step in any criminal investigation,” the department said. “It serves to analyze legal issues, identify investigative needs, and ensures the matter is prepared for prosecution evaluation, all while detectives continue to investigate.”
Salt Lake City police urged anyone with information on the case, including video, to “come forward.” Digital evidence can be submitted through the department’s public evidence portal. Or, they said witnesses can speak with an officer by calling 801-799-3000. 
The department declined to release any further information regarding the screening or any additional comment on the material that’s been gathered to “protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation.”

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The presumed frontrunner to lead the Maryland Democratic Party cannot fully assume his duties if elected, and the possibility of an extended delay leaves open the potential the party might have to elect another leader before the end of summer.
Hundreds of Democrats are expected to gather Saturday in Prince George’s County, where the agenda includes election of a state party chair to replace Ken Ulman, who stepped down last week. Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D), handpicked by Gov. Wes Moore (D), is expected to be the frontrunner.
But a snag involving state campaign finance law, and Pittman’s inability to immediately close the account that funded his contests for county executive, will bar him from fully assuming the role upon his election.
After a meeting late Wednesday between his campaign representatives and state elections officials, Pittman acknowledged the legal hurdle and said he “won’t officially take office until the account is closed out.”
“We’re fully complying with the law that says that you can’t take office as the chair of the party until you’ve closed your account. So I won’t take office until that’s happened,” Pittman said. “The election will move forward because that’s when the meeting is. But I don’t take office until the account is closed.”
To do so, Pittman said he is undergoing a review of the account by state elections officials. But neither the review nor closing the account will happen before the scheduled June 21 vote.
A party spokesperson said in a statement that Pittman told the party “that the standard process in order to close his county executive campaign account is underway and should be complete before the end of June.”
Maryland Democrats celebrate party wins, but Trump and GOP Congress are never far off

“If he is elected as chair this Saturday, he will officially assume the role upon completion of the close out of his account in accordance with state law. In this scenario, [Vice Chair] Dr. Charlene Dukes would remain acting chair until the account is closed,” the statement said.
Party bylaws require a new chair to be elected within 60 days of a vacancy, and Ulman’s resignation last week means the party could hold a vote as late as August, giving Pittman time to resolve the campaign discrepancy.
But party officials said they are committed to a vote this week, since the meeting has long been scheduled — the party is required to hold two meetings a year, usually in the summer and fall — and scheduling another meeting in two months could create problems for party leaders who must come from far-flung corners of the state.
Pittman said he expects the state elections board to expedite his efforts to close the account. Should that effort drag in August, however, party leaders would be faced with having to elect someone who could take office immediately.
In the meantime, Pittman said that if elected he will limit his activities to transition work and meeting with staff.
“I won’t even be quoted as party chair,” he said. “I won’t be putting up documents as party chair. Dr. Dukes will be acting chair until I am legally the chair.”
Alive and a Democrat
Dukes, first vice chair since 2023, has been acting chair since Ulman’s resignation took effect June 13of the party. She has said she is not interested in the position. But having an acting chair allows the party to continue to raise and expend funds while the party seeks a permanent leader.
There are few qualifications for party leadership: Some say in jest that to qualify one must be “a registered Democrat and alive.”
Pittman, however, faces an additional hurdle stemming from his open campaign account and state law. State Board of Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis said the law is meant to prevent candidates from directing funds in ways that skirt state law.
“The intent of this prohibition is so that you cannot circumvent contribution limits,” said DeMarinis, who spoke generally on state law and not specifically on Pittman’s situation.

	“If I’m a candidate and I had my personal account, and someone gives me $6,000 but also control … another committee, I can tell that person to also give $6,000 to that committee,” DeMarinis said. “Then I can direct those monies to benefit my campaign and in fact exceed the contribution limits because I was in control over multiple accounts.”
After Ulman announced he was stepping down, Moore immediately nominated Pittman — who is not expected to be the only contender — for the post.
Pittman, who is term-limited as county executive, said he did not discuss his campaign account discrepancy with the governor. It is unclear if Moore’s staff picked up the issue in any vetting process, and a Moore spokesperson did not provide a comment for this story.
 ‘A labor intensive process’
The obvious solution – closing the campaign account — could take weeks, possibly longer. An ongoing problem with recordkeeping has left a discrepancy in his campaign finance filings.
Pittman must resolve a $1,500 difference between his stated bank balance and his reported cash balance. Until that happens — or until the elections board signs off on his unsuccessful efforts to find the problem — Pittman cannot close his account.
Pittman attributed the problem to a discrepancy discovered in previous years. He said his campaign hired an outside firm to identify the problem and assist with amending reports with the state board after the board identified problems in routine audits.
A review of his reports shows that Pittman’s campaign account was balanced in the annual report filed in January 2024. By April, the books were off again by $1,490. Seven months later, a new report showed he had $1,500 more in his bank account than he reported in cash on hand.
Campaign accounts are generally audited by the state every two to three years. All filings — annual and required pre-primary and general election reports — within that period are reviewed. Closing an account would trigger an earlier audit.
Discrepancies, including differences in cash and bank balances or other record issues, would have to be resolved, DeMarinis said.
In general, campaigns can hire someone to do it or turn over all the records to the state board, which would then sift through those records to resolve the problems.
Ulman to step down in June as Maryland Democratic Party chair

“It’s a labor-intensive process,” DeMarinis said.
It is also a process that can lead to  civil penalties for failing to accurately report contributions or expenditures. Fines can start as low as $50 for a first offense, but rise for subsequent offenses. Any penalties would also have to be paid before an account closes.
Pittman would also have to legally dispose of the cash balance before closing the account.
In his January filing, Pittman reported $61,775 in his bank account, but cash on hand of $60,275.83 — a gap of $1,499.17. The report, due Jan. 25, was not filed until Feb. 23, according to state records.
DeMarinis said his office is assisting Pittman and the party to resolve the issue.
“We would do this for any political party if they had an issue with selecting a new chair because we know political parties need officers to operate,” he said.
‘They came up with a blank’
In June 2023, a routine audit conducted by the state board identified repeated cash discrepancies and record-keeping issues in Pittman’s account.
Eight letters from the board to Pittman’s campaign and obtained by Maryland Matters identified repeated issues with record keeping and balances. Six letters cover discrepancies in reports for 2022, two others touch on problems in 2021 and 2023 reports.
Pittman said, with campaign managers coming and going, “It’s been a consistent problem … which is why we did a forensic audit to determine whether there was any wrongdoing.”
“That’s as much as I know how to do, is to fully go through everything. And there are times when there is just no receipt that is found, and there is nobody to blame. There is no person who did any wrongdoing,” he said. “So that was the due diligence that we did.”
Pittman said he believed his campaign addressed those earlier concerns.
“We hired the forensic accountant to make sure that there was no wrongdoing that they could identify anywhere in the campaign, and they couldn’t find anything,” Pittman said. “But they also couldn’t find where, what that money had been spent on. Obviously, there were no receipts for those expenditures and so they came up with a blank, which, of course, is frustrating.”
Pittman said he thought after the forensic review the matter was closed. A review of his campaign filings appears to show the current discrepancies are unrelated to those earlier issues.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pittman, who acknowledged the account discrepancies that have dogged his campaign of late, said party officials who are electing a new chair should not be concerned that those issues will carry over to party accounts.
“If your question is whether I am a fiscally responsible leader who will make sure that the people who work under me are managing their dollars, I think you can look at the AAA bond rating that Anne Arundel County got for the first time under my leadership, and you can say that I have been a fiscally responsible leader as county executive,” Pittman said.
“I think the party has a history of managing their finances in a responsible way. I think the treasurer of the party is somebody who has been doing that work for quite some time and is very responsible. I think the staff does as well,” he said. “So, I think the party is in good hands, and it would be in good hands under me in terms of managing his finances.”
An expedited process?
Pittman said he will turn over his campaign records to the board for review in what he described as a routine audit. Coupled with that review is an effort by the board to resolve the discrepancies in Pittman’s account.
“But based on what I’ve heard from the meeting that they had today [Wednesday], and the meetings they’ve been having, is that it’s going to take some time to go through it — go through the process,” Pittman said. “They’re going to do it more carefully because questions have been asked and they’re going to expedite what would normally be a 30-day audit. Based on that, I’m confident that we’ll be able to close the account.”
DeMarinis declined to comment on a specific timeline.
“We know that political parties need to operate for elections, and we understand their concerns,” he said. “But we will never change our business practices or procedures to compromise the end result.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DSC_0112-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-20 20:01:42.384860

(Photo courtesy Army & Air Force Exchange Service)A small decrease in the state’s gas tax is coming in July.
New tax rates released by the Office of the Comptroller set the new tax rate on gasoline at 46 cents per gallon. The decrease of one-tenth of a penny is the second in two years and the fourth since a 2013 law was enacted that linked automatic increases to the rate of inflation.
By law, the comptroller must set and announce the new rate by June 1, to take effect on the July 1 start of the fiscal year.
Maryland’s gas tax includes two components — the Consumer Price Index and pre-tax prices on gasoline.
In 2013, lawmakers passed legislation coupling a portion of the gasoline tax to inflation. The rate can only go up — capped at 8% annually — but never decreases.
Over the last year, the inflation index increased 2.7% — down seven-tenths of a percent from the previous year. The increase in inflation will add nine-tenths of a penny to the gas tax.
That increase was offset by a drop in the pre-tax price of gasoline, according to Robert Rehrmann, director of the Board of Revenue Estimates.

Rehrmann, in a May 23 letter to Gov. Wes Moore (D), Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), said the pre-tax sales price decreased by a full penny year over year.
“The new rates, as a result of slower inflation and lower fuel prices, decrease by 0.1 cent per gallon and are 46 cents per gallon” for gasoline and clean-burning fuels, Rehrmann wrote in his letter.
That means the current rate of 46.10 cents per gallon for gasoline will decrease to 46 cents even. The tax for diesel fuel, called special fuel, will decrease from 46.85 cents per gallon to 46.75 cents, according to the rates released by the Office of the Comptroller.
When lawmakers passed a law increasing the gas tax in 2013, it was the first such increase in more than two decades. The Democratic majority in the legislature that year indexed future increases inflation. The automatic increases, calculated annually, would not require politically charged debates and votes.
The law included a safety valve meant to prevent spikes if annual inflation grew by more than 8% annually. At the time, sharp inflation spikes were rare.
Two years ago, the gas tax rate jumped by nearly 7 cents per gallon, driven by an annual inflation rate of 7.1% and higher wholesale gas prices.
The new rate for fiscal 2026 is just the fourth decrease since the tax was indexed to inflation in 2013. In each case, lower wholesale prices were the cause.
Decreases in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 were caused by lower fuel prices during the pandemic, when fuel demand waned as more people worked from home and traveled less.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/9030514.jpg,,,2025-06-20 20:01:42.384860

Copley Hospital will close its birthing center, the hospital announced in a press release late Friday afternoon, though no specific closure date was given.
Copley’s Women’s Center will remain open, and pre- and postpartum care will continue to be offered at the Morristown hospital. More details will be provided to staff and patients of the birthing center in the coming weeks, the press release said. 
“We will share detailed information about our partner labor and delivery hospitals to help facilitate birthing family decision making,” the statement read. “Current staff will be given assistance to transition to new appointments and positions both at Copley and in the region.”
Copley Hospital has been formally considering closing the midwife-led birthing center since March when its board of trustees announced that a consultant was being hired to review several options, though concerns about a potential closure had been raised months earlier.

Since then, community members, including current and former patients, have been organizing public showings of support to try to keep the birthing center open. They hosted a Mother’s Day rally in downtown Morrisville, wrote personal letters of appeal to the hospital’s board of trustees and distributed lawn signs throughout the surrounding area. 
The Copley Hospital Board of Trustees voted for the closure of the birthing center on Tuesday, the press release said. 
Board Chair Anne Bongiorno acknowledged the outpouring of testimonials board members and administrators had received in the release.
“The Board is grateful to the community, Copley staff, and everyone who shared their personal stories, family connections or professional experiences with the birthing center. It has been a privilege to know how much our community cares for our hospital,” Bongiorno said as quoted in the statement. “With the diligent work by everyone over many months, including the consultant’s thorough research and report, we believe we have made the best decision possible in a challenging situation.”
The press release announcing the closure noted Vermont has the lowest birth rate in the nation and Copley has experienced a downward trend in births at the hospital. Currently less than half of all births in Lamoille County take place at the center, according to the release.
Copley Hospital, like other small community hospitals in the state, struggles with maintaining financial stability. The birthing center operates at a loss of between $3 million and $5 million annually, hospital administrators have said. In recent years, the number of births at the center had dropped to less than 200 per year, below the threshold necessary to maintain efficiencies of scale, according to a report by the consultancy Oliver Wyman that proposed ways to reduce overall health care costs. 
Mary Lou Kopas, one of three full-time nurse midwives at the birthing center, said Friday she was “just heartbroken” by the news, which staff had received earlier in the afternoon. 
“I love this group of people,” she said. “It’s a really special practice.”
The Copley birthing center’s staff had just been celebrated recently for the quality of its care and its outcomes at the annual conference for the Vermont Child Health Improvement Program at the University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine, she said.
Kopas acknowledged the financial challenges faced by Copley and the state’s broader health care system, but said  there were strategies hospital leaders could have tried in recent years to boost the number of births if volume was a concern.
“If there was truly a commitment to keeping the service for the community, why was there none of that?” she said.

Hundreds of people gathered outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in St. Albans on Friday, waiting to hear if Wuendy Bernardo, a migrant farm worker who has lived on a dairy in Orleans County for over a decade, would return home to her family or face deportation proceedings.
They cheered as she emerged from the office around 10:30 a.m. to return home to her family with orders to report back on July 21. Migrant Justice, a Burlington-based migrant advocacy organization, estimated that roughly 200 community members turned out to support Bernardo. 
“It’s really difficult because every time I come here I don’t know if I’ll be going back to my family or not,” Bernado said, tearing up while Will Lambek, a Migrant Justice spokesperson, translated. 
Susanna, 79, a retired textile designer from Albany, paced around the parking lot in her raincoat ahead of Bernardo’s arrival. She met Bernardo more than six years ago when she began taking her to prenatal appointments at Bridges to Health, a migrant health care program through the University of Vermont. 
“I’m really nervous about this,” she said. 
She described Bernardo as a charming friend and an excellent mother who loves gardening and her family. (Susanna asked for her last name to be withheld because of her work with migrants). 
Bernardo is a mother of five children, ages five to 18, and guardian to two orphaned half-sisters, according to Lambek. All her children are still in school, and none have immediate concerns about their immigration statuses, he said.

“We’re in a moment of intensifying attacks against immigrant communities around the country and here in Vermont,” Lambek said. “These are premeditated political actions to tear families apart and violate people’s rights.”
Bernardo and her community have been under increasing stress since she was first detained in Vermont in 2019, according to Susanna.
“For a while it was just, ‘be careful and observe the speed limits, and don’t do anything outrageous,’” said Susanna, who also came out to support Bernardo’s prior ICE appointment in April. “And now, of course, it’s no holds barred.” 
Bernardo pulled into the parking lot at 10:00 a.m., accompanied by her daughters. Supporters cheered and called “I love you Wuendy,” as she joined her attorney inside the ICE office. While inside, dozens of cars lined up and down Gricebrook Road and more supporters joined the semi-circle surrounding the office’s front doors. Thirty minutes later, Bernardo walked outside smiling while her daughter tugged the end of her ponytail.

Bernardo’s saga with immigration officials began in 2019 when she was stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection while a fellow parishioner drove her home from church. She and two of her children were detained at a border patrol facility and then the ICE office in St. Albans where they were processed and released, according to Lambek. He said border protection agents gave no reason for pulling the car over. 
Border protection and ICE officials did not answer a request for comment by the time of publication. 
Following the 2019 detention, Bernardo was on a telephonic check in schedule until ICE told her in 2022 to come to the office, ordering her to bring a plane ticket that showed she would leave the country. Bernardo applied for a stay of removal — a formal request that her deportation proceedings be delayed. She was allowed to remain in the U.S. while that request was under consideration, according to Lambek.
But earlier this year, Bernardo was again ordered to report to ICE. In April, about 100 supporters rallied outside the office to support her stay in the country, and she was told to return in two months. Attorneys refiled her stay of removal, and that stay remains pending, according to Brett Stokes, Bernardo’s attorney and the director of the Center for Justice Reform at Vermont Law and Graduate School.

‘A lot of risks’
Abel Luna, a 36-year-old Migrant Justice field coordinator, joined the rally supporting Bernardo with his daughter. Luna, who was a farm worker in New York state beginning at age 13, called the recent detentions and deportations of migrants in Vermont a “fear tactic” by the federal government.
Since April, at least 25 migrant workers and students, including farmers, landscapers and construction workers, have been detained in northern Vermont by border officials.
On Saturday, 29-year-old Jose Ignacio De La Cruz, known as Nacho, and his stepdaughter, Heidi Perez, 18, were pulled over by border officials due to “suspicious border activity,” according to Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Ryan Brissette. The agents smashed their car window and detained both De La Cruz and Perez. De La Cruz is being held at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in Swanton and Perez is at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, according to the state prison locator.

The two have filed petitions in federal district court alleging their detainment was unconstitutional. The chief judge of Vermont district court, Christina Reiss, issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from moving them out of state. Both remain in custody pending deportation proceedings. 
Luna said his community was seeing more arrests during the second Trump administration, especially mass arrests, including a group of eight farm workers arrested in April at Berkshire’s Pleasant Valley Farms, the state’s largest dairy, and the detainment and monitoring of community leaders who worked closely with Migrant Justice like Bernardo, De La Cruz, and Perez.
“Nacho especially, and Heidi in her own right, were both very politically active,” Stokes said. “I think it’s important to consider whether that was a justification for this arrest.” 
Stokes didn’t know if they were targeted for their organizing work, but Luna said outspoken migrant leaders were detained during both Trump administrations.

“But it doesn’t matter who you are, you could be driving on the road and get stopped and detained,” Luna said. “There may be some targeting of leaders, but being a migrant worker in the state of Vermont, being a border state, there’s a lot of risks.” 
Stokes said Bernardo’s situation was unique because she was first detained with an expedited removal order upon her initial entry to the U.S. in 2014, and later let out on parole. Bernardo is currently ineligible for asylum because she didn’t apply during her first year in the U.S., and right now, she doesn’t have a pathway to citizenship. Like many others in the U.S., Stokes said, she has spent her time in the U.S. undergoing periodic check-ins by ICE officials. 
ICE under Trump 
ICE practices have changed under the second Trump administration, according to Lambek. While those under ICE supervision like Bernardo were once monitored through email or telephonic check ins, ICE is now ordering more in person appointments. Lambek said this increases stress for migrants, who know that visiting an ICE office could result in detention and deportation.
State leaders have supported Bernardo’s case for more than two years, including a 2023 letter of support by 67 state legislators, and Stokes said the congressional delegation has assisted his office in getting information from ICE about other migrant deportation cases. But Vermont officials could do more to support migrant workers who live in the state, he said.
De La Cruz and Perez had robust community support from Migrant Justice and were able to quickly get in touch with Stokes to start working on their petitions to remain in the state, but that type of support often requires knowing attorneys, like Stokes, exist.
“A lot of other folks who are detained in the state aren’t that lucky,” said Stokes, who can’t find clients to represent unless they get in touch with him.

“There are many other ICE detainees in the same facilities that I’m in that haven’t contacted me that I don’t think anyone knows are there and they don’t know who to call,” Stokes said. 
There could be a better effort to provide intakes for ICE detainees and triage their individual situations, along with pushing for universal representation in immigration proceedings, he said. Vermont has a small community of legal support for immigrants, and he said it was important for the state to fund that work in a meaningful way.
But for detainees who are well-connected, rallies can help support those like Bernado facing stressful situations. 
“I felt a lot of nerves going in, but hearing the chants of ‘Si Se Puede’ gave me strength and made me think that everything was going to turn out okay,” Bernardo said while Lambek translated. “It’s nice to know that there are still good people in this world, people who are out here supporting our community.”

An […]","Nikki Gronli, former USDA Rural Development state director, speaks at a state Department of Social Services public hearing regarding cuts to TANF benefits at the Sioux Falls One Stop on June 20, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Some needy South Dakota families could soon lose up to $136 a month less to spend on gas, groceries, clothing, utilities, house repairs or rent.
The average South Dakota family in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program receives $515.55 a month, according to the state Department of Social Services. An average of just under 2,500 families get TANF benefits each month.
Those families would lose anywhere from $32 to $136 a month in benefits under a proposed 10% reduction by the department, depending on the size of their family. The state would save about $1.5 million for the year.
Dozens of South Dakotans stood up to speak out against the cut Friday, using words like “asinine,” “appalling” and “ludicrous” to describe it during a public hearing in eastern Sioux Falls. No one spoke in support of the cut.
TANF is a federal-state program most commonly used to provide financial assistance to low-income families with children, on the condition that the caregiver searches or trains for a job. Non-parent relatives — grandparents or aunts or uncles — who take children into their home when a parent is not able to care for them are among the eligible.
Former Gov. Kristi Noem put $5.3 million in TANF cuts into her proposed budget last year in light of a tight revenue year. Lawmakers approved the $5.3 million cuts in March. In Noem’s recommended budget, leftover federal funds reserved for the program were meant to cover the shortfall.
Public hearing: ‘This is not an expense, this is an investment’
Colleen Werner, a former educator and school administrator in Sioux Falls, said at the public hearing she was shocked the state would start cuts “with the lowest and most in need” to save money. Families are paying more for rent, utilities, food and other living expenses than they did last year, she added.

“Imagine if you’re at your financial end and you still step up,” Werner said, a reference to relatives stepping in to care for children who are not their own. “And what does our state do? It just steps on you and cuts your funds when you’ve taken a bold and brave and loving measure to take care of those you love.”
Lisa Sanderson, who said she formerly worked with Child Protective Services, said the proposal runs counter to the department’s mission to support and uplift South Dakota families in need.
Participants, including Sanderson and others, called for more funding and increased benefits, citing inflation and a higher increased cost of living in recent years.
“This is not an expense,” Sanderson said. “This is an investment.”
Department representatives did not recommend any changes to the policy based on the public testimony, but will take written public comment through the end of the month. After that, they’ll present their proposal to the legislative Rules Review Committee. If approved, the reduction would be implemented by Aug. 1.
DSS explains its proposal
The state distributed $15.3 million in TANF benefits last fiscal year. 
The 10% benefit cut is part of the department’s plan to deal with having $5.3 million less to spend on TANF this year. The department also intends to use $3.8 million from a TANF carryover fund to cover some of the cost of benefits for families.
The carryover fund currently holds about $23 million – more than enough to fully cover the $5.3 million budget cut.
The fund has been reserved as a “rainy day fund,” said Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff. He added that some of the unused funds are intended to upgrade the TANF computer system. He said he didn’t know how much the upgrades would cost.

The department could use another $1.5 million from the carryover balance to avoid the benefit cuts. But Althoff called the reduction a “strategic approach” to managing the carryover fund.
He described the fund as a piggy bank that “is not going to last forever.”  Without knowing what the financial landscape looks like in the coming years, reducing TANF benefits by 10% means the department can “keep the piggy bank there” for a longer period of time. 
If state revenues continue to worsen and more cuts are necessary, the department could propose in the coming years to cut TANF benefits more.
The proposed rule change would also remove TANF eligibility for families who take in child relatives who are removed from their homes by the state’s child welfare system. 
The change would incentivize caregivers to become licensed kinship caregivers with the state. The current foster and kinship subsidy rate for a child in SD is between $22.85 and $27.43 a day, depending on their age. That would be roughly $685.50 to $822.90 a month, per child.
Lawmakers approved rule changes in May to create the licensed kinship foster care pathway, as required by the federal government. Caregivers must meet training requirements to become a licensed kinship home, similar though less intensive than traditional foster care requirements.
According to the department, 184 cases per month managed by the department involving families eligible for TANF would be eligible for kinship subsidies.
Families who take in kin and apply for TANF use the “side door” to receive state and federal support, Althoff said. Eliminating eligibility encourages families to “come in through the front door.”
Proposal’s future depends on legislative committee interpretation
Several participants said they were blindsided by the proposal. They said they understood from lawmakers during the state’s legislative session this winter that the $5.8 million cut to TANF would be fully — not partially — offset by money from the carryover fund. 
Althoff briefly mentioned that his department planned to review TANF benefits during a conversation with lawmakers on the state’s budget committee in January, but admitted Friday that “a conversation wasn’t held in earnest with lawmakers.”

Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, said Friday that he didn’t expect TANF benefit cuts this fiscal year. Muckey is a member of the Joint Appropriations Committee. Because of a “significant miscommunication” between lawmakers on the committee and the department, Muckey said it wouldn’t be prudent to advance the TANF cuts.
“If the appropriations committee didn’t intend to do this, we need to have more conversations before we reduce benefits,” said Muckey, who’s also a member of the rules review committee.
“I can appreciate the gravity of our state’s financial situation. What is important is those conversations, as far as our budgetary decisions, are not under the purview of the rules review committee,” Muckey said. “I think the public understands this is a case where the Legislature did not give its permission.”

Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, is also a member of the appropriations and rules review committees. She disagreed, saying there isn’t a way for the rules review committee to determine the Legislature’s intent, since the body did not take any votes specifically concerning the TANF changes. Lawmakers only passed a budget with a $5.3 million reduction in TANF spending, she said.
Howard doesn’t remember discussions about TANF carryover funds during the session, but said  she supports the 10% cut.
“Why aren’t we cutting all of it? Why are we even using carryover funds?” Howard told South Dakota Searchlight. Howard has been critical about welfare program spending in the state.

Tapped for Bureau of Land Management post, Brenda Younkin will report directly to agency’s acting director, Jon Raby. 
The post Trump appointee, a Jackson Hole consultant, ID’d pitfalls of Wyoming managing its federal land appeared first on WyoFile .","Not unlike the current moment, roughly a decade ago a political push to do away with large swaths of federal lands in the West was gaining steam. 
Utah Republican U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz ran a bill at the time that would have transferred 3.3 million acres of the federal estate to state ownership. The bill was later pulled, and the representative resigned his congressional seat after the proposal whipped hunters and anglers into a fury. 
The movement crossed state lines into Wyoming. During state lawmakers’ 2015 general session in Cheyenne, a legislative committee drafted a bill that demanded the transfer of vast tracts of federal lands to Wyoming. Later, the measure was amended to require a study of Wyoming managing federal lands, not owning them.
The Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments was ultimately given $75,000 for the study, and it picked Jackson-based Y2 Consultants to complete the analysis. When the 357-page study was completed the following fall, state land managers and lawmakers were warned that they lacked staff and resources to take over control of 25 million acres of Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Reclamation property that fell within state boundaries.

Brenda Younkin (Y2 Consultants)
“Ultimately, without significant changes to federal law, the greatest challenge would be that the state would be inheriting the same bureaucratic maze of overlapping, entwined, often conflicting federal mandates established in the labyrinth of laws and directives laid out by Congress,” the 2016 Y2 Consultants report stated. “The land management trials, conundrums, and conflicts encountered would largely be the same for the state that exist under present [federal] management.”
The first author listed on the report, a slot that typically denotes the lead, was Brenda Younkin, a natural resource specialist who co-founded Y2 Consultants with her husband, Zia Yasrobi. 
On Wednesday, Politico’s E&E News publicized that Younkin had been appointed by the Trump administration and had started working in a senior advisor post at the Bureau of Land Management, where she’d report to its acting director, Jon Raby. Trump’s first pick to lead the BLM, Colorado oil and gas advocate Kathleen Sgamma, withdrew her bid after it was revealed that she’d written a memo expressing “disgust” for “President Trump’s role in spreading misinformation that incited” the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol. 
WyoFile was unable to reach Younkin for an interview Friday, but an auto-response from her Y2 Consultants email address confirmed a “leave of absence” because of a new gig with the U.S. Department of the Interior, the BLM’s government parent.

According to her biography and past interviews, Younkin has worked in the public lands and ranching sphere her entire career. 
In statements made to the Cowboy State Daily, U.S. Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso both lauded Younkin’s appointment. 
“The more Wyoming voices we can have in the room, the better off we will all be,” Barrasso told the outlet. 
Younkin joins a handful of other Wyoming residents who’ve gone to work for the Trump administration’s Interior Department via political appointments, or who have been nominated for positions.

In early February, former Wyoming Game and Fish Department Director Brian Nesvik was nominated to direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, though four months later his appointment has still not cleared the Senate’s confirmation process. Cyrus Western, a former Republican statehouse representative, was picked to helm the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Region 8 office, based in Denver. Cheyenne attorney Karen Budd-Falen was also selected as the acting deputy secretary under Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. 
Last, southwestern Wyoming big game hunting advocate Josh Coursey was appointed to a Fish and Wildlife Service post, pulling him away from the Muley Fanatic Foundation, which he co-founded. That group has since gone on record opposing a provision expected to be yoked into the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that would mandate the sale of an estimated 2-3 million acres of federal land in 11 western states. 
“Public lands need to stay in public hands and the Muley Fanatic Foundation opposes anything or anyone that threatens our lands that we hold dear for personal use,” President and CEO Joey Faigle told WyoFile in a written statement. “The public land sales being included in the reconciliation needs to stop now.”
If the public land sale mandates don’t stop, the amount of land that Younkin, the Jackson Hole consultant, will be tasked with overseeing at the Bureau of Land Management will shrink. 
The disposal language in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources legislative text demands selling between 0.5% and 0.75% of the BLM and U.S. Forest Service’s 438 million surface acres within the next five years. Although just a fraction of the agencies’ overall holdings, it’d translate to doing away with public lands that collectively add up to an area no smaller than Yellowstone National Park.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Cyclists riding on Pennsylvania highways have no obligation to pull off the road to get out of the way of faster traffic, the state Supreme Court ruled this week. The decision reinforces the right of bikers to use the road just like other vehicles. 
Instead, cyclists must make “reasonable efforts” to avoid impeding the flow of traffic. How they do that, Justice Kevin Dougherty wrote, is up to the judgement of the rider, taking into account factors such as whether it is safer to remain in the lane or move to the shoulder.
“In some cases, the circumstances might require a pedalcyclist to temporarily but completely exit the roadway to allow traffic to pass. In others, it may not be safe or reasonable to expect a pedalcyclist to do so, or at least not right away. And in others still, a pedalcyclist may only need to move to the right side of the lane to comply with [the traffic code],” Dougherty wrote for the majority in the 5-2 decision.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The case centered on cyclist Brendan Linton of Butler County, who fought a $25 ticket he received in July 2021, after a state trooper was unable to pass him and pulled him over as a result.
Bicycling advocates said the decision is an important victory, because it clarifies the right of cyclists to “take the lane” when they’re riding amongst motor vehicles. 
The Supreme Court reversed a ruling by a Butler County judge that a lower appeals court had upheld.
“I’m sure it would have made it that much harder to use the road,” Chris Gale, executive director of the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, told the Capital-Star. 
“I hear from cyclists that they just don’t feel safe on the road. I think what makes it scary is that people who are driving don’t always understand they have to share the road,” Gale said, adding that the right to choose how to travel is an important personal freedom.
But Ken McLeod, policy director of the League of American Cyclists, said the court could have gone further in giving cyclists the benefit of the doubt. The majority found the question of whether a cyclist’s efforts to avoid slowing traffic are sufficient depends on the circumstances and is “best entrusted to trial courts and juries.”
Justices Daniel McCaffery and David Wecht signed a dissenting opinion, arguing that it should be up to police to prove that a cyclist’s actions are unreasonable, rather than the cyclist’s burden to show they acted reasonably.
The dissenting opinion outlines a stronger standard for cyclists, McLeod said.
Most states have a version of a law that simply requires cyclists to remain as far to the right as practicable, McLeod said. He added that like the Supreme Court’s interpretation of Pennsylvania law, other states judge the reasonableness of cyclists’ actions by looking at the totality of circumstances. 
When cyclists are ticketed for slowing motor vehicle traffic, it’s usually because motorists or law enforcement take issue with cyclists choosing to use the roadway, McLeod said.
“I do see these contests from time to time and it’s often because bicyclists have these interactions with law enforcement over time and they want to contest the ticket and prove they’re doing nothing wrong,” he said.
According to the Supreme Court majority opinion, Pennsylvania State Trooper Joshua Osche saw Linton riding his bicycle on Evans City Road, also known as Route 68, in Butler Township. Osche was aware of complaints about bicyclists slowing traffic on the two-lane road and pulled out behind Linton with his dashcam recording.
The video showed the trooper was at the back of a queue of about ten motor vehicles behind Linton, each of which was able to pass within two minutes. Osche twice tried to pass Linton as he rode 19 mph in a 55 mph zone but was unsuccessful, according to the video. It  also showed the shoulder of the highway was obstructed with gravel, potholes, storm drain grates and a construction vehicle and worker.

The trooper stopped Linton and charged him with disorderly conduct, violating the duties of a vehicle operator and failing to use reasonable effort to avoid slowing traffic.
In a bench trial, the Butler County judge found Linton guilty of failing to take reasonable efforts to avoid slowing traffic and not guilty of the other offenses. The Superior Court upheld his conviction on appeal.
The section of the traffic code at issue requires vehicles traveling less than the speed limit on a two lane road to “drive completely off the roadway and onto the berm or shoulder” at the first opportunity to avoid impeding traffic. 
It also states in a separate paragraph that a pedalcycle “may be operated at a safe and reasonable speed appropriate for the pedalcycle” and that a cyclist “shall use reasonable efforts so as not to impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic.”
By reading the paragraphs together, it is clear, Dougherty wrote, the law’s authors didn’t intend to expressly require cyclists to leave the road.
“This makes perfect sense: Given the typically smaller size of pedalcycles relative to other vehicles, it may be possible to safely pass a pedalcyclist that remains on the highway but simply moves to the far-right side of the lane,” Dougherty wrote. “The same is not typically true of other vehicles that merely move to the side.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0039-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-20 19:03:13.145183

A bill seeking to eliminate copayments for reduced priced lunches was vetoed this week by Gov. Greg Gianforte.
House Bill 551, brought by Helena Democrat Rep. Melissa Romano, would have covered the price of reduced lunches for about $600,000 annually from the state general fund.
In a veto letter, Gov. Gianforte said the problem was being taken care of through existing programs. He also raised the cost of the legislation as an issue.
“A variety of federal programs are already available to ensure all students have access to affordable, nutritious meals throughout the school year and summer, such as the SBP (School Breakfast Program), NSLP (National School Lunch Program), Special Milk Program, and the Summer Food Service Program, all of which Montana participates in,” the veto letter reads.
Reduced lunches cost around 30 or 40 cents, but can still add up for struggling parents, Romano said during the session. It also can turn school administrators into collection agents, hurting the trust between parents and the district, adminstrators have said.
“One in six children in MT live in a food insecure household, and school meals can be the most reliable meals in a kid’s life,” Romano said in a press release. “House Bill 551 would have helped kids get a reliable, nutritious meal without worrying about school lunch debt and its stigma. It would have addressed some of the behavioral and attention issues teachers are facing in the classroom and helped kids succeed.”
The move comes as Montana could be losing millions of dollars in federal food benefits if President Donald Trump’s reconciliation and budget bill passes.
The Montana Quality Education Coalition, American Heart Association in Montana, the Blackfeet Nation, Fort Belknap Indian Community, Chippewa Cree Tribe of Rocky Boy’s Reservation, the Helena School District, and the Bigfork Food Bank all were supportive of the legislation during the session.
The bill passed the House 68-30 and the Senate 28-22 in each body’s final vote on the legislation. About 21,000 students currently qualify for free and reduced school lunch bills.
“The Governor failed Montana students today, in particular the most vulnerable,” House Minority leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, said in a press release. “Under the Governor’s watch, low-income kids will continue to enter into debt with their school cafeteria, skip meals, and go hungry in the classroom.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1402987108-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-20 19:03:13.145183

Joe Cook/Georgia RiversAn Alabama-based company that was close to receiving the final go-ahead from the state to mine near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge has decided to instead sell the land to a nonprofit focused on conserving at-risk sites.
Twin Pines Minerals, which first proposed the controversial mining project in 2019, is in the process of selling about 8,000 acres near the refuge to The Conservation Fund. Twin Pines’ president Steve Ingle confirmed the sale through his public relations firm but declined further comment Friday.
The nearly $60 million land deal will halt a mining project that became the poster child of the first Trump administration’s move to scale back federal protections for the nation’s waterways. That left the decision on whether to approve the project in the hands of state regulators, who issued draft permits early last year that were close to being finalized.
The sale also presents a second time a mining proposal near the swamp was thwarted due to public outcry. A DuPont proposal in the 1990s near the refuge faced intense pressure, and the company eventually dropped the project and sold the land to The Conservation Fund. 
Stacy Funderburke, who serves as vice president of The Conservation Fund’s central Southeast region, said efforts to buy the land around Trail Ridge — the mineral-rich target of mining companies that is seen as an important barrier for the swamp — had been in the works for roughly three years. The deal includes the mineral rights for the site. 
“This is the most important conservation project that we’ve ever worked on because of how imminent the threat was, not only to this site, but to the entire Okefenokee Swamp,” Funderburke said.
The sale is set to be completed by the end of July, though The Conservation Fund is hoping to continue raising money from private donors and foundations. Currently there are between 10 and 15 major donors who are funding the project, and more expected to contribute down the road, Funderburke said. 
Funderburke also credits environmental activists across Georgia for their work drawing awareness to the swamp, which he said was a key factor in acquiring the philanthropic backing needed to purchase the land.
“The public response since this threat started six years ago — all the work that’s been done, and all the voices of people across Georgia that have come out and said that it’s not worth the risk to a place like the Okefenokee to have mining immediately next door — that is why I think funders and others have been willing to step up to the table,” he said. “It’s really hearing the loud voice of everyone who wants to see this protected.” 
The refuge has also been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which would cement its status as an international tourist destination on par with the Grand Canyon and Galápagos Islands. 
‘Settled in a good way’
The mining proposal sparked a public outcry and was at the center of a yearslong debate at the state Capitol, where lawmakers from both parties pushed for protections for Trail Ridge. 
Rep. Darlene Taylor, a Thomasville Republican who has become known as one of the swamp’s chief defenders at the statehouse, said Friday that she was delighted by the news.
“Protecting the swamp was what it was all about, and I just feel so much better knowing that it’s going to be secure,” Taylor said.
Taylor said the announced land deal is an ideal compromise.
“It was settled in a good way,” she said. “I think everybody in it can be pretty calm about it at this point. [The Okefenokee Swamp is] being protected, they’re being compensated for it, and we can move forward now.”
U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, had opposed the project from Washington.
“This step toward protecting the Okefenokee Swamp is great news for all Georgians and our beloved natural treasure,” he said in a statement. “For years, I’ve been sounding the alarm that strip mining near the Okefenokee Swamp poses irreversible damage to an irreplaceable natural resource.” 
‘A model for protecting Trail Ridge’
From the start, the mining project was met with concerns about the potential impact on the swamp’s water levels and an ecosystem that is home to thousands of species of animals and plants.
A broad coalition that included environmental groups, faith leaders and others relentlessly warned of the project’s potential harm to the largest blackwater swamp in North America.
Those groups helped galvanize an army of Okefenokee Swamp fans who flooded state regulators any time public input was sought along the way.
“This is an incredibly special outcome and there is no place more deserving than the Okefenokee,” said Megan Huynh, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Georgians sent a clear message to Twin Pines Minerals that mining next to the Okefenokee is an unacceptable risk.
“This wouldn’t have been possible without a powerful coalition, and regular Georgians who were willing to stand up and defend a place as beloved as the Okefenokee,” Huynh said. 
Rena Ann Peck, executive director of Georgia Rivers, said the deal will help pave the way to conserve more of Trail Ridge. There are still more than 25,000 acres left vulnerable to mining, Peck said. 
“I think this is a model for protecting Trail Ridge, the outright land conservation through acquisition and conservation easements,” Peck said. “Retiring the mining rights is paramount to saving it in perpetuity.”
As an advocate, Peck was a vocal critic of the Twin Pines’ proposal. But she said her favorite part of the job is bringing potential land conservation buyers to the Okefenokee in hopes of helping them form a connection with the swamp. 
“I show them the vastness,” she said. “I like to say that you can paddle these 120 miles of canoe trails and still only see 2% of the swamp.”

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)Washington won’t receive federal aid to cover tens of millions of dollars in damage to public property caused by last fall’s bomb cyclone.
The Trump administration denied the state’s request for federal disaster relief in April. Washington filed an appeal, but the administration rejected it Thursday.
The two-paragraph letter penned by a top Federal Emergency Management Agency official says a thorough review reaffirmed the original decision that federal aid “is not warranted.” No reasons are given.
“They still refuse to explain their outrageous decision,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement. “My team and I are working to exhaust every possible avenue to get additional support for our state’s recovery. We cannot count on the Trump Administration to uphold its responsibilities to Washingtonians.”
Last month, Washington’s entire congressional delegation sent a letter to President Donald Trump, urging him to reconsider the April denial.
“It is outrageous,” U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said Friday. “This is exactly the kind of catastrophic event federal disaster aid was designed for. There is simply no justification for this betrayal that leaves local communities and residents of Washington state shouldering painful disaster recovery costs when the federal government was supposed to have their backs.”
The intense November storm damaged hundreds of homes and businesses, caused widespread power outages and killed two people. 
Then-Gov. Jay Inslee declared a disaster and opened up $1 million in state recovery funding for those hit by the storm in King, Snohomish and Whatcom counties. The U.S. Small Business Administration also made low-interest disaster assistance loans available for residents and businesses in Chelan, King, Kitsap, Kittitas, Pierce, Snohomish and Yakima counties.
In January, Inslee asked for federal aid from FEMA to repair damage to highways, public utilities and more. His request focused on Grays Harbor, King, Pacific, Snohomish, Wahkiakum and Walla Walla counties. The state’s request outlined over $34 million in damages across the six counties.

The Zizians have been linked to several homicides across the country, including the fatal shooting in January of a border patrol agent in Vermont.

The alleged leader of the Zizians, Jack LaSota, already jailed in Maryland on state misdemeanor drug and gun charges, has now been indicted on a federal felony firearms offense.
The Zizians have been connected to a cross-country string of homicides, including the fatal shooting earlier this year of a border patrol agent in northern Vermont. 
A federal grand jury in Maryland this week indicted LaSota, 34, of Fairbanks, Alaska, also known as Andrea Phelps, Ann Grimes, Anne Grimes, Canaris, Julia LaSota and Ziz, on a charge of being a fugitive from justice in possession of firearms and ammunition.  
The charge carries a maximum penalty of up to 15 years, if the accused is convicted. 
Prosecutors alleged in court records that LaSota possessed several firearms in February, including a .50-caliber rifle, a handgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. At the time, according to court records, LaSota was a fugitive from justice and as a result was not permitted to possess a firearm or ammunition.

The federal charge against LaSota stems from his arrest Feb. 16 in Frostburg, Maryland, along with companions Daniel Blank and Michelle Zajko. 
All three pleaded not guilty earlier this month to multiple state charges, including trespassing, obstructing arrest and possession of firearms. A Maryland state court ordered them held in custody while those state cases remain pending. 
Zajko has also been charged with federal firearms offenses in Vermont. No court appearance has been set in that case. 
Federal prosecutors in Vermont alleged that Zajko bought the weapons that were in the possession of Teresa Youngblut and Felix Bauckholt, also known as Ophelia, earlier this year. 
Youngblut and Bauckholt were stopped in January by federal agents on Interstate 91 in a traffic stop that led to a shootout that left Bauckholt and Border Patrol Agent David “Chris” Maland dead. 
Youngblut has been charged in Vermont with federal firearms and assault charges in connection with that shootout. Youngblut has pleaded not guilty to the offenses and a hearing in that case is set for next week in federal court in Burlington. 
LaSota, Blank, Youngblut, Bauckholt and Zajko all allegedly had ties to the Zizians, a loosely connected group of people and offshoot of the Rationalist movement. 
Another person linked to the Zizian group, Maximilian Snyder, was arrested in the Jan. 17 murder of a Vallejo, California, landlord. Snyder and Youngblut had previously applied for a marriage certificate in Washington state. 
Zajko’s parents were fatally shot in their Pennsylvania home on New Year’s Eve in 2022, according to police, and Zajko was questioned in their deaths in January 2023. In a letter to the media earlier this year, Zajko denied involvement in the fatal shootings, writing, “I didn’t murder my parents.” 
LaSota, the namesake of the Zizian group, had been charged in 2023 in Pennsylvania with disorderly conduct and obstruction in connection with the probe into the death of Zajko’s parents, according to court records. LaSota did not show up for later court hearings after posting bail and being released, according to court documents.
It’s not clear from the federal indictment handed down this week if the charge of being a fugitive from justice in possession of firearms and ammunition stems from LaSota not appearing for hearings in the Pennsylvania case.  
A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland could not be reached Friday for comment. No attorney was listed for LaSota in the court filings and his lawyer in the state court case could not be reached Friday for comment.

The 5th U.S. Court of Appeals, often cited as one of the most conservative courts in the nation, found the law unconstitutional because it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which bars the government from endorsing a religion or creating laws that favor one religion over another.
The decision upholds a lower court’s injunction that blocked the law from taking effect in five of Louisiana’s K-12 school districts after families with students in those districts sued the state last year. The injunction applies only to the districts where those plaintiffs live.
“We are grateful for this decision, which honors the religious diversity and religious-freedom rights of public school families across Louisiana,” the Rev. Darcy Roake, a plaintiff in the case with her husband, Adrian Van Young, said in a statement from their attorneys. “As an interfaith family, we believe that our children should receive their religious education at home and within our faith communities, not from government officials.”
The legal battle began in June 2024 when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law a bill requiring every school in Louisiana to display posters with a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments.
The appeals court wrote that “under the statute’s minimum requirements, the [Ten Commandments] posters must be indiscriminately displayed in every public school classroom in Louisiana regardless of class subject-matter,” and thus, if allowed to go up, “those displays will cause an ‘irreparable’ deprivation of [the Plaintiffs’] First Amendment rights.”
“This ruling will ensure that Louisiana families – not politicians or public-school officials – get to decide if, when and how their children engage with religion,” said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, one of the groups that represented plaintiffs in the case. “It should send a strong message to Christian Nationalists across the country that they cannot impose their beliefs on our nation’s public-school children. Not on our watch.”
“Religious freedom — the right to choose one’s faith without pressure—is essential to American democracy,” said Alanah Odoms, executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “Today’s ruling ensures that the schools our plaintiffs’ children attend will stay focused on learning, without promoting a state-preferred version of Christianity.”
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, also a Republican, said she intends to seek a review from the full 5th Circuit and, if necessary, turn to the U.S. Supreme Court.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Beef, pie, wine, honey and produce are just a few things Iowans might find on the Choose Iowa Farm Store Crawl happening Saturday and Sunday across the state. 
The crawl is part of the state-run local food marketing and branding initiative to encourage Iowans to support local farms and businesses. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the inaugural crawl is a “fantastic opportunity” for Iowans, and visitors, to experience the “diverse and thriving agriculture” of the state. 
“By connecting directly with local farmers, businesses and restaurants, this inaugural event celebrates Iowa’s rich agricultural heritage and showcases our abundant supply of Iowa grown, made and raised food, beverages and ag products,” Naig said in a statement announcing the event. 
The crawl is a self-guided experience, though Choose Iowa has curated several interactive maps of farms, farm-to-table restaurants and businesses to help Iowans plan their routes. 
The overall map, as well as region-specific information, can be found on Choose Iowa’s website. Choose Iowa has more than 280 members selling or producing local goods in rural and urban parts of the state. Nearly 70 members are participating in the farm crawl event. 
Farm crawlers can also log their stops on the Choose Iowa digital passport for an opportunity to win prizes and receive coupons to their favorite local haunts. 
The farm crawl coincides with Iowa Barn Foundation’s spring barn tour, which allows visitors to tour unique barns through “picturesque” settings in Cedar County.

Hagen is believed to be the only Democrat to serve on the state’s Public Service Commission. 
The Devils Lake native was appointed to fill a vacancy on the three-member board in 1961 by Gov. William Guy. He was reelected to six six-year terms, choosing not to run for reelection in 2000.
He was known for reaching across party lines.
“Two parties are healthy for all levels of government and regulatory commissioners are no exception,” he wrote in an article submitted in 2006 to the National Regulatory Research Institute.  
The PSC regulates utilities and telecommunications, oversees siting for pipelines and energy projects and has a hand in grain and railroad regulations. Hagen and his contemporaries are credited with spearheading the regulation of coal, electricity, oil and gas and electricity in North Dakota. 
His career spanned North Dakota extending telephone service to the entire state in the 1970s to regulating cellphone service in the 1990s.
“I believe that in our capitalist democratic system of government, regulation of monopolies is very important. The counter-balancing power of the people through a fair system of regulation helps preserve democracy,” Hagen wrote in the 2006 article. 
After leaving office, Hagen cited accomplishments such as the PSC taking on reclamation of coal-mined land in 1969, creating what he referred to as “the best reclamation system in the world.”
Hagen also chaired a committee under Gov. George Sinner’s administration to coordinate the state’s first observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1986, after it became a federal holiday.
He made unsuccessful runs for Congress in 1968 and 1978. 
Former North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan said that Hagen stood out among state leaders for his lifelong service.
“There was one North Dakotan named Bruce Hagen who, for decades, relentlessly continued his dedicated public service to our state,” Dorgan, a Democrat, said Friday in an email. “He was a thoughtful, quiet leader whose judgement on important issues always supported the best interests of the people he served.”

Hagen first got involved with politics in 1960, when he was invited to campaign with Guy, who was running for governor. Hagen at the time unsuccessfully ran for commissioner of agriculture and labor as a Democratic-NPL candidate. He spent a short time as deputy registrar for motor vehicles before his appointment to the Public Service Commission.
Susan Wefald, a Republican who served alongside Hagen on the Public Service Commission in the 1990s, called Hagen a thoughtful and outgoing commissioner who always did his homework. She noted he was known to save every paper that came across his desk.
Hagen’s daughter Marin said she has fond memories of visiting her father’s office and joining him in parades during campaign season. 
She said when her father traveled to Washington, D.C., for an annual conference for utility regulators, he always insisted on staying with family or friends so the state wouldn’t have to spend taxpayer money on his lodging.
“That’s just how he was programmed,” she said. “He always did the right thing.”
Marin described her father as a “voracious reader” and a lifelong learner. He also enjoyed gardening, traveling and spending time in nature. She said when her family would visit relatives in Devils Lake, her father would always stop the car and take a moment to admire the landscape.
“He always wanted to look at the land, and I sort of rolled my eyes when I was younger,” she recalled. “I appreciate it now.”
In 1988, Sinner awarded Hagen the North Dakota National Leadership Award of Excellence. At the time, Hagen was serving as the president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners.
In announcing that he would not seek reelection in 2000, Hagen said: “I have enjoyed and appreciated working on the commission over all these years to help the vital, necessary industries change, modernize and become more efficient while bringing reasonably priced services to North Dakota people.” 
In 2018, the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party recognized Hagen with the Spirit of the Non-Partisan League Award. 
Hagen served in the Korean War. He continued to farm in Benson and Ramsey counties during his years in office. Funeral services, which have not yet been scheduled, will be at Parkway Funeral Home in Bismarck and at the Norway Lutheran Church Cemetery west of Devils Lake.

,DC,2025-06-20 22:08:32+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Vance dispatched to LA after Trump administration court victory in National Guard case,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/vance-dispatched-la-after-trump-administration-court-victory-national-guard-case,,"Vice President J.D. Vance took a victory lap to Los Angeles Friday, following a federal appeals court’s ruling that the administration could retain control of the California National Guard troops responding to protests earlier this month over immigration raids in the city.“BIG WIN in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the President’s core power to call in the National Guard!” President Donald Trump wrote on social media following the decision.Vance was scheduled to visit an FBI building being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, meet with law enforcement leadership and U.S. Marines and deliver remarks, according to a White House release Friday morning.The trip was announced about 12 hours after the administration’s win at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that Trump could keep control of the 4,000 National Guard troops he’d ordered to Los Angeles.Three judges on the appeals court issued a unanimous opinion Thursday evening that courts had to afford the president wide discretion to decide when a state National Guard can be federalized, leaving command in Trump’s hands while California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s lawsuit challenging the deployment is ongoing. The case has been closely watched by leaders of states around the country.The order overturns a lower court’s ruling that Trump return control of the troops to Newsom, a Democrat who opposed sending the National Guard to Los Angeles. Newsom has said the Guard troops’ presence has only inflamed tensions between anti-ICE protesters and law enforcement.The president has the authority to deploy troops to a state with or without the governor’s consent, the panel of appeals judges said Thursday.The state’s “concerns have more bearing on the question of whether the President should have federalized the California National Guard, not whether he had the authority to do so,” the panel, made up of two judges appointed by Trump and one by former Democratic President Joe Biden, wrote.They opted to revoke the district court’s temporary restraining order, reasoning that the federal government stood a good chance of ultimately prevailing on the case.Quelling rebellion, enforcing lawsAttorneys for the state had argued in federal court that Trump’s order was invalid because he did not show the conditions that the statute Trump cited, Section 12406 of U.S. Code Title X, required for federalization of a National Guard had been met and because the order was sent to the California National Guard adjutant general, not to Newsom himself.The 9th Circuit panel rejected both arguments.Based on the language of the statute alone, the judges might have required greater support for the federal government’s position, which may have helped California’s case, the order said.But under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the president only must meet a low standard to show that deployment is warranted to enforce laws or quell a rebellion, the judges wrote in language that resembled what Judge Jennifer Sung, the Biden appointee, said during oral arguments Tuesday.“We are not writing on a blank slate,” they wrote. “The history of Congress’s statutory delegations of its calling forth power, and a line of cases …  interpreting those delegations, strongly suggest that our review of the President’s determinations in this context is especially deferential.”The federal government’s evidence that protesters had thrown rocks and other objects at ICE officers, vandalized federal property and attacked vans used by ICE was enough to satisfy that standard, the judges wrote.Trump quickly took to social media. “The Judges obviously realized that Gavin Newscum is incompetent and ill prepared, but this is much bigger than Gavin, because all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done,” Trump wrote.In amicus briefs in the case, Democratic state leaders have said they see Trump’s use of the National Guard as a threat to their ability to use their Guards for state-level functions, including drug interdiction and natural disaster relief.Some reviewabilityThe opinion did, however, reject the U.S. Justice Department’s argument that a president’s federalization order could never be questioned in court.In a statement, Newsom praised that aspect of the ruling and pledged to “press forward” with the case.“The court rightly rejected Trump’s claim that he can do whatever he wants with the National Guard and not have to explain himself to a court,” Newsom said. “The President is not a king and is not above the law.""U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer canceled oral arguments at a previously scheduled Friday morning hearing in the trial court, after the 9th Circuit order.Breyer anticipated that the state may pursue a challenge based on a potential violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement, and asked each side to file a brief by noon Pacific time on June 23 arguing whether the trial court or appeals court should first hear that issue.",,,,2025-06-20 19:03:13.145183

Addressing Israel’s attacks against Iran Wednesday in a call with reporters, Grassley said he would “prefer military action only if there’s an immediate threat to the United States.” He said he prefers “negotiation over military action,” but notes “Iran is an enemy of the United States.”

In a discussion with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during a hearing with the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, Ernst questioned the role of Iran in the Oct. 7 attack against Israel by the militant group Hamas. 
“Forty-three Americans lost their lives on October 7th, at the hands of Hamas, which is an Iran-backed terrorist organization,” Ernst said during the hearing. “When there is question about whether it’s appropriate for America to be engaged in the Middle East and defending Americans that live and work abroad, I think there’s our answer.”
Ernst works with newly appointed defense official to prevent sexual assault in the military
Ernst announced at the hearing she would hold quarterly meeting with newly appointed Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office overseer Steve Erickson. Hegseth noted a decrease in military sexual assault numbers this year at this discussion. Ernst also said she plans to propose an amendment that would require quarterly briefings from SAPRO to members of Congress 
“We want to make sure that we continue the momentum that we are seeing within the Department,” Ernst said in a press release. 
Advocates urge Iowa senators not to ‘Shut Down’ the clean energy tax credit
A six-figure advertising campaign launched by Protect Our Jobs is urging Grassley and Ernst to stop cuts to clean energy production. POJ is an eight-figure campaign defending clean energy workers and local economies. The commercial “Shut Down,” is currently playing on television channels in Des Moines, Omaha and Cedar Rapids. It will also run on digital platforms within the state.
Several supporting research papers were included in the initial press release to provide data points on Iowa’s clean energy economy: 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, roughly 62% of Iowa’s total energy production comes from clean energy sources of which roughly 59% came from wind power. According to a research brief published by Bluegreen Alliance , repealing clean energy tax credits puts an estimated 4,329 Iowa jobs at risk. This also could pose a risk to the 99 data centers stationed in Iowa, one of the largest concentrations in the midwest.
“When Congress talks about cutting clean energy production, that’s a major problem for Iowa’s economy,” said the narrator in the ad.“We’ll see businesses shut down, higher energy bills for families, and farmers struggle. Our senators, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, know what clean energy means to Iowa. Senators, the stakes are high for Iowa, let’s stop these cuts to clean energy production.”
Grassley-led resolution to promote streaming service passes Senate unanimously
A bipartisan resolution from Grassley and Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar urges all television providers to carry the network C-SPAN 2, which provides an uninterrupted coverage of the Senate floor.
“Transparency brings accountability, and C-SPAN’s coverage has brought transparency to the people’s business,” Grassley said in a press release. “The Senate unanimously stands behind C-SPAN in its fight to be platformed by streaming giants.”
Grassley-led resolution to rededicate June to stopping elder abuse
Grassley and Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal introduced a bipartisan resolution to recognize June as “National Elder Abuse Awareness Month.” The resolution also seeks to stand “in support of seniors who’ve been victim to fraud schemes.” This would coincide with the federal recognition of June as LGBTQ Pride month. June has been federally recognized as Pride month for 14 of the last 25 years.
“For every elder abuse case that’s reported, as many as 24 go unreported. These aren’t just numbers. They’re our parents, our grandparents, our neighbors and our veterans,” Grassley said Monday on the Senate floor. “Elder abuse isn’t limited by geography or income. It occurs in nursing homes and private residences — the very places meant to offer them care and protection.”
Nunn-led act aims to combat agriculture cyber-attacks
Reps. Zach Nunn and Don Davis, a Democratic legislator from North Carolina, introduced an act to establish five “Regional Agriculture Cybersecurity Centers.” This bill seeks to “safeguard Iowa’s agricultural economy from cyber threats by harnessing the expertise of land-grant universities including Iowa State University.”
“We’ve already seen hackers shut down grain handling and meat processing operations with just a few lines of code, stealing American agricultural technology or holding our food supply for ransom,” Nunn said in a press release. “By leveraging Iowa’s leadership in agricultural and cyber defense innovation at institutions like Iowa State, we’re putting the nation’s top minds to work protecting the backbone of America’s economy: our farmers.”
Feenstra leads bill to expand rural broadband network
Reps. Randy Feenstra and Teresa Leger Fernandez, a Democratic legislator from New Hampshire, introduced a bill to aid the construction of broadband in rural Iowa. This act would require “edge providers,” such as Google, Amazon, etc., to contribute funds to networks built and maintained by the Universal Service Fund. 
“Access to high-speed internet is critical to our economic growth in rural communities. Families, farmers, and businesses across rural Iowa go to great lengths to collect and deploy the necessary funds to build reliable, affordable broadband,” Feenstra said in a press release. “However, Big Tech companies use these networks once completed but rarely contribute their fair share towards the cost. It is completely unfair.”
Miller-Meeks discusses ‘big, beautiful bill’ with Muscatine small business owners 
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks visited small business owners in Muscatine this to hear their thoughts on the “big, beautiful bill.”
“I proudly voted for President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill,” Miller-Meeks said in a press release. “It cuts taxes, eliminates red tape, and gives working families and small businesses the freedom to grow and thrive. I’ll never stop fighting to protect Iowa’s values and way of life.”
Hinson ‘applauds’ new renewable fuel requirements for 2026-2027
Rep. Ashley Hinson issued a statement in response to the Environmental Protection Agency’s announcement to increase Renewable Volume Obligation levels in 2026 and 2027. RVO’s dictate the amount of renewable fuel that gasoline and diesel refineries have to blend into their fuel supply. 
“Earlier this year, I led a bipartisan letter to President Trump, urging him to propose robust blending targets, especially for biodiesel, after the Biden Administration’s low RVOs caused several biodiesel plants in the Midwest to stop production,” Hinson said in a press release. “This is a strong first step, and I look forward to my continued work with President Trump and Administrator (Lee) Zeldin to expand domestic production of liquid transportation fuels.”

The Vermont Department of Health said the number of emergency room visits for Covid-19 briefly dropped to zero, although it has since ticked up.

The number of emergency room visits for Covid-19 in Vermont hit zero multiple times over the past week, “at or nearing” a historic low for that indicator, the Department of Health reported Wednesday.
The health department first reported a drop in Covid-19 hospital visits in its weekly surveillance report. Epidemiologist John Davy confirmed via email there have been a few recent days with no emergency room visits, with the rolling average around one. 
He wrote that overall hospitalizations for the disease, which includes Vermonters who have been in the hospital with Covid-19 for days or weeks, have not dropped to zero. But the number of current patients has been in the “low single digits” in recent weeks. 
In past years, the period of late spring and early summer has been marked by low rates, followed by a rise in the late summer into early fall. Davy wrote it “remains to be seen” if that pattern will reappear in the coming months. 
“There have been recent outbreaks in Long-Term Care facilities, so there is clearly some amount of COVID circulating,” he wrote.
Chart via the Vermont Department of Health
The state health department also reported it has detected the presence of a new Covid-19 variant, NB.1.8.1. The variant has made international headlines for causing severe sore throats nicknamed “razor blade throats.” But it has not been found in Vermont in large numbers, Davy wrote. 
“There is no clear indication that NB.1.8.1 is associated with greater disease severity,” he wrote. “Preliminary lab studies suggest that vaccines will be effective against severe outcomes from this strain.”
The future of vaccines themselves are still uncertain, however. Covid-19 vaccines tailored to the dominant strains of the virus have typically become available in early fall, along with other seasonal vaccines like influenza. But U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has a long history of anti-vaccine activism. 
Kennedy recently dropped the recommendation for pregnant people and healthy children to receive the vaccine and dismissed all 17 members of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory panel, replacing them with eight of his own appointees, some of whom have previously objected to the Covid-19 shots. The panel is slated to hold its first meeting June 25.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Central Iowa Water Works reinforced Friday that water coming out of the system’s treatment plants continues to meet federal safe drinking water standards. 
The regional water production authority said the lawn-watering ban has been effective at reducing load and allowing treatment facilities to keep the drinking water nitrate levels below the federal limit, despite near historic levels in source water. 
“We don’t anticipate that there’s going to be any concern with our water not meeting safe drinking water standards because of the hard work that everyone is doing with the lawn watering ban,” Tami Madsen, CIWW executive director said at a press conference Friday. 
CIWW issued a lawn watering ban on June 12 due to exceptionally high levels of nitrate which can cause problems like blue-baby syndrome or other adverse health effects when consumed in high concentrations.

Rumors circulated on social media Thursday that CIWW was expecting nitrate concentrations in output water to exceed the federal safety standards, but Madsen shut down the rumors and said CIWW has “no concerns” of that happening, because the lawn watering ban has been so effective.

Madsen said while CIWW does not expect its output to exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s drinking water standard, which for nitrates has a maximum of 10 milligrams per liter, but if it did CIWW would communicate with the public. 
“Unless you hear it directly from Central Iowa Water Works, our water is still safe to consume through the safe drinking water standards,” Madsen said. 
Des Moines Water Works’ Fleur Drive plant and the Saylorville Water Treatment plant have the capacity to remove nitrates from the water. CIWW has plans to expand treatment capacity by 25% in the coming years, which would help to reduce future lawn watering bans. 
Iowans across the state asked to conserve water due to dry wells, high nitrate levels

Madsen said the nitrate levels in the river have gone up slightly due to recent rainfall. Friday afternoon figures from CIWW had the Des Moines River at 14 mg/l and the Raccoon River at 15 mg/l. Water coming out of out of the system had concentrations around 8 mg/l. 
Madsen said on average it cost about $16,000 a day to operate the nitrate removal facility, which is only turned on at the Fleur Drive facility when necessary. Nitrate levels tend to spike in the spring and early summer when rain washes nutrients off of fields and other surfaces up the watershed. During the current spring flush of nitrates to the system, the removal facility has been operating for more than 60 days. 
The levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers are below 10 mg/l for most of the year, according to charts from the Iowa Water Quality Information System. 
Saylorville facility 
Madsen spoke Friday outside of the Saylorville Water Treatment Plant which uses ultra filtration membranes and reverse osmosis filtering to remove contaminants, including nitrates, from water it sources from groundwater wells along the Des Moines River. 
Ted Corrigan, CIWW’s system operator, said this dual-membrane filtration is the normal process, regardless of nitrate levels, for the 10-million-gallon per day facility. 
Corrigan said membrane treatment is “the next generation” of water treatment technology, and represents the direction the industry is moving to treat drinking water. 
The Saylorville facility is in the design phase to double its capacity as part of several planned CIWW projects to expand capacity. Madsen said this expansion was in response to the anticipated capacity increases from residential growth, rather than higher anticipated levels of nitrates in source water.

The Saylorville expansion, along with a new facility in West Des Moines and expansion in Grimes, however, will all have the ability to filter nitrates. The total expansion is expected to be completed within the next seven years, and cost estimates are around $1.3 billion according to a regional water treatment facility study. 
CIWW officials did not respond to questions relating to funding for the expansion projects and to pay for operating the nitrate removal system.
Madsen, when asked about efforts to control nitrate runoff up the watershed, said the focus of CIWW is to “continue to provide safe drinking water” to the region.
For now, that means the lawn watering ban stays in place until further notice. CIWW allowed splash pads and spraygrounds to reopen Thursday to help Iowans cool off during the anticipated high temperatures this weekend. 
“We just need to continue to stay vigilant with the lawn watering ban so that we can reduce the capacity to be able to continue providing water that meets all safe drinking water standards,” Madsen said. 
Central Iowa Water Works posts regular updates about the ban and nitrate levels on social media and on its website.

Though the building has changed hands, its use as ICE’s “Law Enforcement Support Center” — staffed 24-7 to help law enforcement agencies around the country prosecute immigration cases — won’t change.

This story by Jason Starr was first published in the Williston Observer on June 19.
The brick office building at 188 Harvest Lane that houses the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency was sold in May by Burlington’s Pizzagalli Properties to a Washington D.C. company that specializes in leasing property to government agencies.
The sale of the 75,000-square-foot building closed for $20 million, according to Williston Town Clerk property records.
Though the building has changed hands, its use as ICE’s “Law Enforcement Support Center” — staffed 24-7 to help law enforcement agencies around the country prosecute immigration cases — won’t change. The buyer, Easterly Government Properties, Inc., said in a news release that the building comes with a “non-cancelable” lease with the U.S. General Services Administration that runs through 2031.
“With this asset, we continue to increase our cash flows derived from federal agency tenants like the DHS and facilitate operations which remain mission-critical to the safety and security of the United States,” Easterly President and Chief Executive Officer Darrell Crate said in the release.
Easterly owns about 100 properties throughout the country that are leased to the federal government, the release states.
The ICE website describes the Williston building as a single point of contact for law enforcement agencies around the world, “providing real-time assistance … regarding aliens suspected, arrested or convicted of criminal activity.”
A detailed description of its operations on the site outlines the center’s role in helping law enforcement personnel verify immigration status and “remove aliens from the U.S. who pose a threat to public safety and national security.” Staff also conduct proactive investigations to inform ICE field officers’ work around the country.
The building has been the epicenter of citizen protests against immigration policies under President Donald Trump, both in his first and current terms. Most recently, hundreds of protesters marched along Harvest Lane and gathered in front of the building on May 1.
“I’m here because I believe in social justice and human rights,” Shelburne’s Joanna Cole told VTDigger during a May 1 interview in front of the building. “I do not want any immigrants forced out, especially illegally. I think it’s horrible so many people are being kidnapped off the street and being thrown in jail.”
Pizzagalli Development Manager Bob Bouchard said the protests had no impact on the company’s decision to sell.
“We are selling a few of our properties right now,” Bouchard said.
Pizzagalli built the building in 1999 after winning a U.S. government bid to provide office space to what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It was a deal facilitated by longtime Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy in an effort to bring federal jobs to the area.
“It’s been a great property with a great tenant,” Bouchard said. “We have nothing but positive things to say about the lessee, which is the government, or the occupant, which is ICE.”
He said the company recently completed upgrades to the building with the intention to sell.
“As soon as we were done with the renovations, the property went on the market,” Bouchard said, calling Easterly a “first-class organization.”

At a City Hall press briefing on Wednesday, Burlington Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak introduced City Circle, a community-based initiative designed to respond more effectively to minor criminal ordinance violations and reduce repeat offenses downtown. The violations could include littering, public possession of alcohol, unlawful trespass, disorderly conduct and unlawful mischief, among others.
People who commit these violations would have the chance to discuss their offense with the community.  The program would discourage disruptive behaviors by holding people accountable for their actions.
“The goal is to connect and engage with people and provide them with the support that they need to build their capacity to be accountable for any harm that their behavior is causing in the community,” City Attorney Jessica Brown said. 
If someone accused of a criminal ordinance violation decided not to join in the program, they would receive a court summons. The city attorney’s office would file charges in the Vermont Superior Court and could request a warrant if they failed to appear.

City Circle would be run by the Burlington Community Justice Center and involve law enforcement or community service officers, volunteers who live or work in the downtown center, and the victim of the crime, if they chose to take part.
Brown said the ordinance to establish City Circle still needs feedback from different stakeholders and will be presented to the City Council and Ordinance Committee in the next few months. The goal is to have it take effect by the end of September.
“Based on some initial conversations with a couple of city councilors, who both expressed enthusiasm about the City Circle concept, we’re also confident that the Ordinance Committee and City Council will approach this project with a spirit of collaboration toward passage,” Brown wrote in a statement to VTDigger. “Generally I think there is enthusiasm among many stakeholders for trying something new when what we’ve been doing within the system has not been particularly effective.”
The mayor also presented another initiative called Situation Table, which is meant to complement City Circle. The program would bring together different organizations, city agencies and police officers to share expertise and provide services based on people’s specific needs. Focus areas would vary in different communities but could include services related to mental health and addiction, housing, education, health, and child and family services.
Situation Table is already widely used in Canada and the U.S., including four tables in other Vermont communities.

NEW ORLEANS — A federal appeals court on Friday struck down a Louisiana law that requires public schools to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom.
The 5th U.S. Court of Appeals, often described as one of the most conservative courts in the nation, found the law unconstitutional because it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which bars the government from endorsing a religion or creating laws that favor one religion over another.
The decision upholds a lower court’s injunction that blocked the law from taking effect in five of Louisiana’s K-12 school districts after families with students in those districts sued the state last year. The injunction applies only to the districts where those plaintiffs live.
The legal battle began in June 2024 when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law a bill requiring every school in Louisiana to display posters with a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments.
The appeals court wrote that “under the statute’s minimum requirements, the [Ten Commandments] posters must be indiscriminately displayed in every public school classroom in Louisiana regardless of class subject-matter,” and thus, if allowed to go up, “those displays will cause an ‘irreparable’ deprivation of [the Plaintiffs’] First Amendment rights.”
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, also a Republican, said she intends to seek a review from the full 5th Circuit and, if necessary, turn to the U.S. Supreme Court.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The 16-year-old accused of shooting and killing three people — including a pregnant woman and an infant — at a West Valley City carnival over the weekend is being charged as an adult.
Prosecutors charged Matthiaz Cantre Lauti Ioane-Register with four counts of aggravated murder and nine counts of felony discharge of a firearm in Salt Lake County’s 3rd District Court, according to court documents unveiled on Friday. 
Police say Ioane-Register was at West Valley City’s WestFest on Sunday when he opened fire in a crowded area, killing an 18-year-old who was believed to be the intended target, as well as a 41-year-old woman and an 8-month-old baby. 
The baby was killed in a stroller alongside their twin sibling, prosecutors say.

The 41-year-old woman was eight weeks pregnant, according to Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill. Ioane-Register is also being charged with the murder of her unborn child. Two other teenagers — a 15-year-old and 17-year-old —- were injured after sustaining gunshot wounds to their arms, Gill said.  
Per federal law, children charged as adults cannot face the death penalty or be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Ioane-Register is currently being held in jail without bail. 
Gill also confirmed an ongoing investigation into whether responding officers fired their weapons. On Sunday, a West Valley City Police Department spokesperson said one of the officers fired a single round toward the suspect, but didn’t hit him or any of the victims.
“Anytime a law enforcement officer uses any lethal force we have a task force that is involved to do that investigation,” Gill said. “That did happen and that’s a separate, unconnected investigation that is pending.” 
Gill told reporters that the shooting is likely gang-related. Ioane-Register, believed to be a member of the gang Titanic Crips Society, was seen on surveillance footage confronting a group of people at the carnival who Gill said were likely part of a rival gang. Moments later, Ioane-Register opened fire, using a handgun that prosecutors say was reported stolen in Louisiana.

Officers recovered 12 shell casings from the area, according to court documents. They believe Ioane-Register fired the handgun in the crowded area until the magazine was empty.
The 16-year-old then quickly turned to flee but was apprehended by police. Gill described the aftermath of the shooting as tense, as people gathered around a detained Ioane-Register, yelling at him and screaming “F— TCS,” the acronym for the gang. 
Police then moved Ioane-Register to a more secluded area, according to the charges, where he denied shooting anyone other than his intended target, for whom he appeared to show little remorse. 
“I’m gonna tell you guys right now, I know what I hit because I know where I was aiming, and I know where I was shooting. I did not hit no baby (sic). It was only one person I hit,” he told officers, according to court documents. “He was already over there on the ground, and I been hitting him. That was the only person I went for. No other bullets went flying elsewhere. There was only one direction. So, there is no way I hit that baby.”
But later, when he was interviewed by detectives, Ioane-Register changed his story, telling them he didn’t know the 18-year-old intended victim, didn’t have a firearm and spent the evening “at WestFest with some homies, just chilling,” according to prosecutors. 
When officers told him the 18-year-old was killed, he “laughed and smiled,” court documents read, telling officers he “just liked to laugh about things that are funny.” 
More ‘intense’ crimes with younger suspects 
Gill said on Friday that while violent crime in Salt Lake County isn’t necessarily increasing, he’s noticing more intense crimes involving younger suspects.
Historically, most homicide suspects in Utah are between the ages of 19 to 28 years old. But according to a recent report from the University of Utah School of Social Work, Gill said that range is now 10 to 19 years old. 
“We are becoming more organized, we are becoming more sophisticated as well as the proliferation and access of stolen guns in younger and younger ages is causing this kind of stuff,” he said.  
Gill called for more resources to curb what he described as a growing problem. 
“Instead of fighting with hands or other things, the easy access to guns is driving these numbers. And that’s something we should pay attention to,” he said. “I think we have about four to six years to invest in the infrastructure so we can stay on top of it.”

(Photo by Greg LaRose / Louisiana Illuminator)Even though the nation’s highest court upheld a state-level ban on gender-affirming care for young people this week, local advocates in New Mexico say legal protections here stand.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld Tennessee’s 2023 ban on gender affirming care for minors. The same year that Tennessee enacted the prohibition, New Mexico went in the opposite direction with two new laws intended to protect this kind of health care.
New Mexico legally protects the trans community — but fear persists

New Mexico enacted the Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Freedom Act, which in part prohibits government entities from restricting or discriminating against a person’s right to access abortion and gender-affirming care. State lawmakers and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also enacted the Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Protection Act, which shields abortion and gender-affirming care providers from civil or criminal liability and discrimination by state licensing boards and by other states that lack these protections.
These state laws still stand despite the ruling, according to a statement released on Wednesday by seven New Mexico-based organizations.
“In New Mexico, we safeguard people’s access to the care they need,” the groups said. “Gender-affirming care is still protected and fully legal in the state of New Mexico.”
The group includes: the Transgender Resource Center of New Mexico, Equality New Mexico, ACLU of New Mexico, Bold Futures, Tewa Women United, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains and ProgressNow New Mexico.
“In upholding Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for young people, the court got it wrong,” the group said. “Denying transgender youth the health care they need solely because they’re trans is discriminatory. These laws block healthcare access and undermine the right we all have to bodily autonomy.”
Republicans in the New Mexico Senate on Wednesday, on the other hand, applauded the ruling, saying it permits state governments to ban gender-affirming care and arguing the New Mexico Legislature should reverse course.
“In stark contrast to the common sense we’re seeing out of Tennessee, New Mexico practically encourages children to undergo these permanent physical changes,” said Sen. Nick Paul (R-Alamogordo) in a statement. “After all, New Mexico funds these transgender surgeries with taxpayer dollars and even allows them to occur without parental consent. It’s time we show some common sense and enact protections for our kids by banning these irreversible procedures.”
The New Mexico community organizations said Wednesday all major medical associations have determined gender-affirming care to be safe, appropriate and effective.
“Gender-affirming care saves lives,” the group said. “We know that placing barriers between young people and medically necessary care deprives them of the chance to grow, thrive, and live authentically – in their own bodies and within our communities.”
In a “friend of the court” brief filed in the Supreme Court case, the two major professional associations for historians in the U.S., as well as the LGBTQ+ History Association, argue that surgical intervention, cross-sex hormone therapy and puberty blockers are well-established mainstream forms of health care and are not experimental or untested.
“Although gender-affirming care for adolescents is often depicted incorrectly as recently developed in a field previously restricted to adults, adolescents with parental consent have had well-documented access to medical interventions to alleviate distress from gender dysphoria in the U.S. for the past sixty years,” the historians wrote.
The group of New Mexico community organizations said transgender people have for generations faced efforts to erase them from public life — and every one of them has failed.
“This is no different,” the group said. “A world without trans people has never existed and never will.”

Ron DeSantis is taking a second try to get Adam Kissel on the University of West Florida Board of Trustees.
Kissel appeared before two Senate committees seeking confirmation to the position earlier this year and received a “recommend refuse to confirm” each time. The full Senate never took up his appointment, requiring the governor to reappoint him to keep serving.
In a Friday afternoon news release, DeSantis announced he was reappointing Kissel, who has remained on the board since the governor first named him in January, and added Edward Fleming, a Pensacola attorney, to the board.
Senators rejected Kissel, a West Virginian and Heritage Foundation fellow, citing concern with his lack of ties to the state; for advocating defunding public universities; and suggesting the GI Bill led to over-enrolled four-year colleges.
Now, Kissel can serve on the board at least until the Senate reconvenes next year, when it can vote again whether to confirm or reject him.
DeSantis shook up the Pensacola institution this winter when he and the university system’s Board of Governors, primarily appointed by him, placed eight new members on the UWF board. Those members faced extensive questioning by senators and two of them resigned before they could be confirmed.
Senators took issue with the appointees’ lack of local ties and their support of the now-resigned chair, Scott Yenor, a professor in Idaho who faced backlash for proclaiming that LGBTQ+ practices bring “dreaded diseases” and labeling career-oriented women as “medicated, meddlesome, and quarrelsome.” The bipartisan Jewish legislative caucus called Yenor “antisemitic.”
Kissel told a Senate panel that ultimately voted against him that he agreed with “probably everything” in the education section of Project 2025, a nearly 1,000-page document released last year led by Heritage detailing conservative ideas for the incoming U.S. president. It recommends dismantling  federal student aid programs, eliminating diversity efforts, and expanding public funding for private and home schools.
Kissel received his bachelor’s degree from Harvard and master’s from the University of Chicago. He served as deputy assistant secretary for higher education with the U.S. Department of Education during President Donald Trump’s first term.
Since the heated Senate questionings, UWF President Martha Saunders announced her resignation and the Board of Governors has approved Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. to serve as interim president starting in July.

Vermont State Police say they are investigating the suspicious death of a woman whose body was found along the side of a road in Woodbury.
Authorities have released few details of the ongoing investigation, which they reported began around 3:30 p.m. Thursday after police received a call that a body had been found at a roadside pull-off along Route 14.
First responders who arrived at the scene confirmed that the person, a woman, was deceased, according to a state press release issued Thursday night. 
Police have called the woman’s death “suspicious,” the release stated. No one was in custody. 
The woman’s identity has not been released pending further investigation and notification of her relatives, the release stated. 
The woman’s body was expected to be taken to the Vermont Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in Burlington for an autopsy to confirm her identity and determine the cause and manner of her death, according to the release.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Residents of District 25 are still short one representative after the death of Rep. Cindy Schreiber-Beck due to uncertainty about whether the southeast North Dakota Republican Party district properly elected a chair.
Secretary of State Michael Howe said Friday there may not be a legal path in state law for him or Legislative Management to fill the vacancy.
Ann Smith, who described herself as chair of the District 25 Republicans, issued a news release Friday naming Richland County Commissioner Terry Goerger as the new lawmaker. Schreiber-Beck, a Republican from Wahpeton, died in May. When a lawmaker dies while in office, state law calls for the district committee of the political party to appoint a successor.
Hours after that news release, the North Dakota Republican Party issued a statement saying the appointment of Goerger is invalid.

Matthew Simon, newly elected state chair of the NDGOP, said District 25 is not recognized as an organized district under NDGOP rules because it did not complete a valid reorganization by a May 15 deadline. He said the district has no chair and no authority to make an appointment. 
It’s Sen. David Hogue’s job as Legislative Management chairman to formally notify the district chair about a legislative vacancy. If the district doesn’t make an appointment within 21 days of getting that letter, then Legislative Management makes the appointment, according to state law.
But in this case, it’s unclear who Hogue was supposed to notify and the 21-day clock has not started, according to an analysis by the Attorney General’s Office. Hogue sent letters on June 10 to both Smith and Erik Nygren, former chair of District 25.
“It’s a quagmire,” said Hogue, R-Minot. “Maybe this is why we have a third branch of government, to tell us who the district chair of the Republicans in District 25 is because I don’t know at this point.”
Howe said Friday the Secretary of State’s Office can’t issue a certificate of appointment for Goerger because the request came from someone who is not confirmed to be chair of the District 25 Republicans.
“A certificate of appointment will not be issued until the NDGOP acknowledges that a District 25 Republican Party district exists and is organized,” Howe wrote in a letter to Smith Friday.
Smith did not return a call seeking comment Friday. 
Nygren, the former District 25 chair, posted on Facebook on May 2 that the original District 25 reorganization meeting on April 26 violated the district’s bylaws and possibly state law. He added to “avoid confusion and potential legal challenge” the district would hold a new reorganization meeting on May 10. 
It is unclear which bylaws or state laws were violated during District 25’s reorganization meetings.
North Dakota Republican Party division apparent as new chair elected in split vote

Goerger said Friday he was interviewed by the District 25 Executive Committee over the past week and informed he would be their appointee. He added he is aware of the disagreement over the chair position, but declined further comment because he was not directly involved.
A news release said Goerger, of Mantador, was elected to the Richland County Commission in 2022 and is a member of more than 20 local and state boards, such as the North Dakota Renewable Energy Council, National Biodiesel Board and the North Dakota Soybean Council.
The NDGOP said the state party plans to work with the district to hold an organizational meeting by Aug. 31, with the help of a parliamentarian to make sure actions meet legal and procedural standards.
The North Dakota Republican Party is divided,between establishment and populist factions, with members of the State Committee voting 24-22 to elect Simon as state party chair last Saturday in five rounds of voting. The State Committee did not allow a representative from District 25 to vote. 
The legislative appointment would run through Nov. 30, 2026. Legislative Management meets next week and is expected to appoint lawmakers to interim committees and other governing boards.

(Photo provided by Lockheed Martin)As many as 180 South Carolinians could be out of a job after Lockheed Martin announced it will layoff 10% of staff working in the global aerospace giant’s Greenville facility.
The layoffs follow a decision by the United States Air Force not to continue a $900 million contract for maintenance and upgrades of the country’s fleet of F-16s. The contract, announced in 2020, was supposed to last for 10 years and bring 15 “Fighting Falcons” to Greenville annually for maintenance , but the government ended it early.
“To meet our customers’ needs for affordability in a cost-competitive environment, we made the difficult decision to conduct a limited reduction in force at our Greenville site. This decision was made with a great deal of consideration and careful evaluation, and we’re committed to supporting affected employees with outplacement services and career counseling,” according to a company statement.
Lockheed has operated in Greenville for more than 40 years, moving into the former Donaldson Air Force Base in 1984. As of last August, the company employed more than 1,800 people at its Upstate location.
While the Air Force contract is ending, Lockheed will continue to build F-16s for the international market. As of February, the company still had a backlog of 117 planes to produce, selling the military fighter jets to countries such as Bahrain, Bulgaria, Morocco, Slovakia and Taiwan.
As Lockheed dialed back F-16 production in 2019 and shifted its focus to other models, it moved the F-16 manufacturing line to Greenville as it continued to fill orders. In 2024, the company produced 16 of the aircraft, according to financial reports.
The Greenville facility also performs maintenance and upgrades on several of the company’s other models, including the C-130, P-3, KC-10, and C-9.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lockheed_Bulgarian_Minister_of_Defence_Ceremony_Remarks-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 18:04:27.715421

Roger Wicker, are part of a larger $21 million award for infrastructure improvements for airports across the state.","Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport is set to receive much-needed upgrades and improvements after receiving more than $4.1 million in Airport Infrastructure Grant and Airport Improvement Program funding from the Federal Aviation Administration. 
The grants, announced this week by Sen. Roger Wicker, are part of a larger $21 million award for infrastructure improvements for airports across the state. 
“Upgrading local air travel is an investment in the future of Mississippi. This funding will bring necessary advancements to our airport systems and provide more business opportunities for Mississippians. I look forward to these improvements being made to spur economic development in our great state,” Wicker said in the announcement. 
Last week, U.S. Congressman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., announced some of the federal grants, including $158,334 for Hawkins Field, the smaller joint civil-military public airport under the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority and located in northwest Jackson.
The Jackson airport also received an $8 million Airport Terminal Program grant from the FAA last year, Wicker announced in February of 2024. That money was slated for terminal rehabilitation, including placing escalators, elevators, HVAC systems, generators, passenger boarding bridges and baggage belts.
In previous legislative sessions, Rep. Earle Banks, D-Jackson, has authored legislation requesting millions of dollars for upgrades to the Jackson International airport, though the bills died in committee. The legislation that he introduced, he said, was for urgent repairs to the airport’s elevators, escalators and cooling towers. 
“Parts are not easy to find for that. That system for the escalators is about 50 years old, and they aren’t easily available,” Banks said. “That’s why for the elevators at the airports, we cannot get those parts. Some of those parts are not readily available.”
Banks said that the airport is a major driver for Mississippi’s economy, and it’s important to invest into the services that keep travellers moving forward. 
“One of the things you have to realize Mississippi, about the Jackson Airport, known as Medgar Evers, is we have got to have an airport that is first class to bring in first class businesses and first class tourism. We’ve got to keep our airport up,” he said. 
Banks points to the state’s attempts to gain control of the airport as one reason why the legislation failed. In 2016, then-Governor Phil Bryant signed Senate Bill 2162, which aimed to wrest control from the five member Jackson Municipal Airport Authority, which is appointed by Jackson’s mayor, to a nine member board appointed by the state. 
The fight over the airport has been wrapped up in legal proceedings since then, with the city of Jackson alleging that this law is racially discriminatory and violates the Mississippi and the U.S. Constitution. In May of this year, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves denied the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
“JMAA might in fact continue to operate the airport for years to come. That is becauseafter the case wraps up here, there will likely be another appeal to the Fifth Circuit and perhaps a petition for U.S. Supreme Court review,” Reeves said in the decision. “And if all that litigation ends with a victory for the defendants, there will be an administrative process in Washington, D.C., in which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) decides whether to approve a transfer from JMAA to the new, state-controlled authority. … For now, though, the status quo has been maintained.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/07090829/airport_Capture.png,,,2025-06-20 18:04:27.715421

The Rhode Island Senate’s 32-4 vote was divided along party lines with all four Republican senators opposed. The Senate’s decision marks the penultimate hurdle for the state’s annual tax-and-spend plan. The last stop: Gov. Dan McKee’s desk for signature.
The Rhode Island House of Representatives approved a carbon copy of the spending plan in a 66-9 vote on Tuesday.
The $14.3 billion bottom line for fiscal 2026 falls $433 million shy of the record, $14.8 million final budget for the prior year. But, it’s $118 million higher than what McKee proposed in January.
Despite a series of new and increasing taxes and fees on motorists, nicotine pouch users and high-end second homeowners, the spending plan drew relatively little opposition in both chambers this year. Advocates praised the inclusion of extra health care funding for primary care providers, hospitals and nursing homes, though many acknowledge the extra money is not a panacea for the deep wounds of the state’s health care industry.
The cash-strapped Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) is also facing uncertainty, with $15 million of its $33.6 million shortfall plugged in the final budget, partly through a 2-cent-per gallon increase in state gas taxes. RIPTA CEO Chris Durand indicated the remaining shortfall may lead to layoffs of 90 of the agency’s staff, along with a 20% cut to service of buses other than the paratransit program. 
In addition to a hike in gas taxes, the budget also increases the real estate conveyance tax, and adds a new property tax on second homes valued at over $1 million. Meanwhile, costs for traffic violations, short-term public parking and electric and hybrid vehicles are all going up under a set of new and increasing fees and tax changes. 
Despite vocal and persistent advocacy, lawmakers opted to forgo a “millionaire’s tax” on top earners, though House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi indicated that might be considered if and when lawmakers reconvene for a special session in the fall — subject to fallout from the federal budget.
Other elements of interest in the spending plan include:

Extending the state’s 5% hotel tax to short-term rentals, dividing up the revenue it generates between homelessness services, municipalities and local tourism districts
Imposing an 80% wholesale tax to nicotine pouches (The tax already applies to other tobacco products.)
Adding a new $4 per-person fee to monthly health insurance premiums to fund a state assessment of primary care and other health care needs
Revising the state’s Rebuild Rhode Island tax credit program to allow the developers of the Superman building in downtown Providence to qualify for a sales tax exemption on construction materials
Increasing state aid to local school districts for special education students and backfilling an inadvertent $12 million shortfall in state aid already required for students in poverty
Adding $22 million in the long-term capital projects budget for the state’s share of costs in the Washington Bridge rebuild

McKee’s office did not immediately respond to questions Friday regarding when he will sign the budget.
Sen. Ryan Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat, was absent from the vote Friday.

Ned Lamont announced Friday that Amy Porter, a veteran state administrator, will become the acting commissioner of the Office of Health Strategy, replacing Deidre Gifford, who revealed plans to retire in May.
Porter will continue in her current position as the commissioner of the Department of Aging and Disability Services.
“I appreciate Amy for agreeing to serve at OHS on an acting basis while we explore the future leadership of this agency,” Lamont stated in a press release. 
Lamont also complimented Gifford, who was a senior advisor to Lamont during the COVID-19 pandemic, serving as the acting commissioner of the Department of Public Health while maintaining her responsibilities as commissioner of the Department of Social Services. She took over as OHS commissioner in 2023. 
Lamont praised her service in all three state departments.
“I appreciate all that she has provided our state, and I wish her the best on this well-earned retirement from a career filled with significant accomplishments in the service of the people of Connecticut,” said Lamont.
Lamont also praised Porter, who has served at ADS and its predecessor agencies since 2012.
“Amy Porter has served in leadership roles in Connecticut state government for well over a decade, and she is intimately familiar with our state’s health and human services needs, especially the needs of the most vulnerable populations that depend on access to affordable, quality health care.”
Gifford announced her resignation from OHS last month as The Connecticut Mirror was preparing to publish a story demonstrating her involvement in the state’s audit of Helen Zervas, owner of Family Eye Care in Bristol, in the days before DSS officials cancelled the audit in 2020. 
Zervas was charged with conspiring to have the audit of her Medicaid overpayments cancelled. Zervas pleaded guilty in February. DSS officials canceled the audit after Zervas offered to pay the overbillings, according to emails obtained by CT Mirror between Gifford and John McCormick, who was then head of the state’s Medicaid audit division. 
Zervas was engaged to former Democratic state Rep. Christopher Ziogas, who was charged with allegedly paying former state deputy budget director Konstantinos Diamantis $95,000 to pressure high ranking state officials to drop the probe in 2020. 
Ziogas and Diamantis were indicted on federal corruption charges by a grand jury weeks after Zervas pleaded guilty. They were released on bail and are awaiting trial.

No state stands to lose more in Medicaid cuts being discussed in the “Big Beautiful Bill” than Montana, according to several new reports. That translates to nearly 40,000 people losing health insurance, billions taken out of the state’s economy, and a new mountain of paperwork for state workers.
Current projections show that 31,000 to 38,000 Montanans could lose health coverage, with small and rural healthcare organizations taking a huge financial hit, while increasing paperwork and requirements for less federal funding.
The Montana Healthcare Foundation, which has tracked the results of Medicaid’s expansion in the Treasure State since its inception, as well as publishing yearly academic research on its effects on the state, reports that no state stands to lose more on a per-capita basis than Montana.
“On a percentage basis, Montana would lose more federal funding than any other state in the country, with an estimated 32% decrease in federal Medicaid funds over the next 10 years,” says a new report issued by the foundation titled “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act: Impacts on Montana Medicaid.”
Medicaid in Montana covers nearly 1-in-every-5 residents, and estimates say that as many as 38,000 people could lose healthcare coverage, with 4,000 of those being elderly, children or disabled Montanans.
The Daily Montanan sent questions to both of Montana’s U.S. senators, Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, including whether they supported the bill, and if they had concerns about its economic impacts on the health of Montanans or the state’s healthcare system. Neither of the senators, both Republicans, responded to questions.
But Daines appeared on FOX News on Tuesday, claiming it was Democrats who wanted to doom Medicaid, and that it was the Republicans who were looking out for it.
“It’s an important safety net, but we’ve got to reform Medicaid if we’re going to save Medicaid. We’ve got to take able-bodied males who are laying on the couches at home and get them back to work and off of Medicaid,” Daines said.
However, data tracked by state leaders show that 93% of people enrolled in Medicaid in Montana either work at least part-time, are full-time students, disabled or elderly, with the remaining small percentage being people who have recently lost a job or are transitioning to one of the other categories. Meanwhile, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms those estimates another way: As of February 2025, it estimated fewer than 17,000 in Montana who were eligible for the workforce were not employed, consistent with the state’s historically low unemployment rate.
Montana, which places a tax on healthcare providers to help support Medicaid’s expansion, would also be prohibited from increasing or adding to those taxes in order to help support the program — even though the taxation program has been highlighted by conservative lawmakers as a way to help share costs, even among the businesses that benefit by the expanded coverage.
The Montana Healthcare Foundation estimated that the state would lose $5.7 billion during the course of the next 10 years from federal support, shifting the burden to Montana, leaving state officials to choose whether to increase funding or decrease coverage.
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimated that nationally, 16 million people would likely lose some form of health care. It also said that uncompensated care — that is, care that hospitals have to provide without reimbursement due to a lack of insurance — will soar by $283 billion during the next nine years in America, if the bill is passed.
In Montana, the report said that Montana healthcare will lose billions in the next decade, in a variety of areas, while increasing the cost of uncompensated care, creating a sort of double-whammy hit:

A loss of $2.6 billion in spending ($1 billion loss to hospitals, $200 million less to physicians, $700 million to other healthcare services, $800 million to prescription drugs).
An increase of $1.2 billion in uncompensated care ($300 million to hospitals, $100 million to physicians, $500 million to other healthcare services, $200 to prescription drugs).

  Rural areas impacted most 

Various reports analyzing the bill seem to center on at least one common conclusion: The cuts that would be required in the new Medicaid provisions would disproportionately hit rural providers in Montana. That spells trouble for two-thirds of Montana’s Medicaid-covered population who live in rural areas.
“Since Montana expanded Medicaid in 2016, 93% of Montana’s critical access hospitals reported adding or expanding specialty care services allowing them to provide care to rural Montanans previously only accessible in more urban areas,” the Montana Healthcare Foundation report said.
  Logistical challenges 

Some of the reports analyze what the changes in the reconciliation bill would mandate, and one of the new wrinkles include more work requirements for participants, which would, in turn, require a significant increase in documentation by states.
One of the new proposed work requirements would mandate 80 hours of work or qualifying activities per month to be eligible for Medicaid. This would require the state to develop and implement new tracking systems to verify the work. Even for someone who has lost a job, they would still have to demonstrate they’re working 80 hours to enroll in the program, according to the Healthcare Foundation.
Workers could see more “churn” or cycles of qualifying or not qualifying that would lead to inconsistent coverage and potential bureaucratic hassles.
“It would also cause ‘churning’ in and out of coverage for eligible adults, particularly for Montana’s seasonal workers such as firefighters and agricultural workers,” the report said.
This eligibility process, which requires “redetermination,” shifted in Montana to a yearly verification, as well as checking work requirement in 2023. That resulted in the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services to admit that thousands of Montana residents lost coverage because of technical issues, not related to eligibility, but to paperwork related to the process. New provisions within the “Big Beautiful Bill” would shift the redetermination period to every six months, speeding up the already cumbersome process.
“In (2023), nearly two-thirds (63%) of enrollees lost coverage due to procedural reasons, like incomplete paperwork, and not because they were determined ineligible,” the foundation report said.
  Hurting the state’s budget 

According to the Pew Charitable Foundation’s analysis of how the Medicaid changes in the federal bill affect local states, researchers broke down impacts on state budgets, and the results show a destabilizing effect on the Treasure State.
For example, the recent Medicaid expansion with federal support has helped stabilize the state budget. Montana’s trend line has shown a decreasing amount of state support and increasingly better healthcare outcomes for its residents.
For example, since 2023, the state’s overall contribution to the program has shrunk from 9.9% to 9.2% of the budget. Most of the states that touch Montana, with the exception of North Dakota, have seen a similar trend line where they spent less than the previous 15-year average on Medicaid.
According to Pew, most states’ spending pattern shows a general decrease in state spending, which has allowed Montana and others to spend money elsewhere.
Montana also fares better than most states because of its Medicaid agreement with the federal government. The average state contributes nearly one-third of the cost, while the federal government contributes the rest. But in Montana, the federal government covers nearly 80% of the cost, meaning that any cut to Medicaid overall will have an outsized and likely negative impact on Montana.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-480940202-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-06-20 18:04:27.715421

Measles cases are in 34 states with North Dakota now the focus

A Utah County adult has been diagnosed with measles, state health officials said on Friday. The person was unvaccinated and didn’t report any out-of-state exposure, meaning that the infection was transmitted within Utah, they warned.
The Utah Department of Health and Human Services said it hasn’t identified any other cases in the state as of Friday morning. However, they’re encouraging Utahns who may have been in the same area as the infected person to monitor themselves for symptoms.
Before the diagnosis and during the illness’ infectious period, the Utah County resident visited several public places and medical centers in Orem, including Parkway Health Center on June 13, and the Timpanogos Regional ER, which the patient visited on June 14 from 2:14 p.m. to 7:02 p.m., the department said in a news release.
“People who were at these sites at the same time or two hours after this person could have been exposed to measles,” the release says. “We encourage unvaccinated people who were in these locations during the exposure time period to monitor themselves for symptoms.”

Dr. Leisha Nolen, Utah Department of Health and Human Services state epidemiologist, told reporters on Friday afternoon that those were the places the individual visited during the most contagious window of the virus.
The patient is between 20 and 40 years old, is currently doing well and has been isolating at home with very limited contact with others since the diagnosis, according to Nolen.
 Doctor warns there may be additional cases of the measles in Utah

This is the first confirmed measles case after an isolated case reported in 2023, Nolen said. However, this time experts suspect there may be additional measles cases in the state.
“This individual who we just identified, who has measles, had not traveled outside of Utah, so that means they were exposed somewhere in Utah from someone who was here,” she said. “We have not been able to identify how that happened. So certainly there is some person who was able to transmit the virus to this individual.”
Some of the patient’s family members were exposed to the virus, are watching out for symptoms, and have been advised to remain at home, Nolen said.
The Utah diagnosis comes amid a national spike in measles cases reported in at least 36 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Thursday, there were 1,214 confirmed cases across the country and 23 outbreaks reported in 2025.

Measles symptoms typically show up 7 to 14 days after exposure. Symptoms like fever higher than 102.2°F, cough, runny nose or red eyes may indicate early stages of measles. A rash could appear after four days of fever, the Department of Health and Human Services said.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases public health officials know of. An infected person can just walk into a room and spread it to almost everyone there, Nolen said. The disease may stay in the air two hours after that kind of exposure.
Those who may have contracted the virus from exposure to the Utah County resident may be experiencing symptoms now.
Nolen highlighted that the best protection against measles is the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which, she added, is safe. Two doses ensure 97% of protection, and most Utahns already have it.
More than 90% of Utahns are reported to have the MMR vaccine and “are highly protected against infection,” according to the department. However, infants younger than age 1 aren’t eligible for the immunization and are especially vulnerable to measles.
“The MMR vaccine has been used since the early 1970s. It has saved millions of lives and prevented significant suffering around the world,” Nolen said in a prepared statement. “The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. Decades of careful research has shown the benefits of being vaccinated against measles far outweigh any risks the vaccine may pose. We encourage those who are not vaccinated to talk to their doctor about receiving the vaccine.”
The epidemiologists recommend Utahns to track down information on their vaccination status to ensure protection. Partially-vaccinated adults can get a second dose, and those who are unable to find immunization records could also get an additional dose, Nolen said.
While most Utahns have been vaccinated, there has been a decrease in vaccination rates among Utah children in the last five years, Nolen said.
“The numbers are still not super low, but they’re low enough to cause us to be concerned that there could be kids who are vulnerable to this, and certainly there are parts of our state or schools that have higher numbers of kids that are not vaccinated,” she said. “So we are concerned that little kids are susceptible to this. There could be an outbreak in a school. So we really would like to encourage people to get them and their children vaccinated.”
A measles infection shouldn’t be considered minor, Nolen stressed. While its symptoms can be common among children, statistics show that 1 in 20 kids will go into the hospital due to severe illness.
“And that’s really significant. I think none of us want any kids in the hospital,” she said. “We also know kids can die of this. We’ve already had three deaths in the United States. We don’t want any more.”

The Education Freedom Account program, created by the wide-ranging Arkansas LEARNS Act, provides up to 90% of the annual per-student public school funding rate for allowable expenses, including private school tuition and homeschooling. The state budget set aside $32 million for the program for the 2023-24 school year and an additional $65 million for 2024-25, totaling roughly $97 million.
That number increased to $177 million for the upcoming school year, not including Friday’s allocation of $90 million from the state’s restricted reserve fund, Department of Education Chief Fiscal Officer Greg Rogers told the Arkansas Legislative Council.

F.2. fy26 restricted reserve 
Little Rock Democratic Sen. Clarke Tucker asked Rogers if the cumulative amount of funds set aside will be enough to cover all accepted Education Freedom Account applications for the school year.
The education department is still accepting applications, Rogers and agency Chief of Staff Courtney Salas-Ford reminded the committee.
“We’re following the process that we have,” Rogers said. “Right now we think it is [enough] but we’re still continuing to evaluate that.”
To manage the large influx of applications, ADE is evaluating and approving applications based on funding priority categories within designated application priority windows, instead of a first-come, first-served basis, according to the education department’s EFA website.
Three-week priority windows began in early March, and the sixth window will close Sunday, Salas-Ford said.
The Advocate reported that 37,000 students had been approved for the EFA program as of June 2. This number had increased to 39,000 out of the 44,000 applications received, education department officials said Friday.
About 28,000 applicants have sought vouchers for private school while 16,000 have been homeschooling applicants, Salas-Ford said.
The $90 million EFA allocation previously received approval Tuesday from the Legislative Council’s Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review subcommittee. The full council is responsible for giving final approval to its subcommittee’s actions when the Legislature is not in session
House Minority Leader Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, tried Friday to pull the allocation out of PEER’s report and vote on it separately. His motion failed on a voice vote after Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, asked education department officials how many EFA applications would not be able to receive funding without the $90 million.
Rogers said about 12,800 applicants would lack funding for the 2025-26 school year.

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)NEWARK, N.J. – A federal judge on Friday ordered the government to immediately release a pro-Palestinian activist from the Louisiana immigration detention center where he’s been held since March 9.
Attorneys for the activist, Mahmoud Khalil, said that after more than three months of fighting his detainment and potential deportation, Khalil can be reunited with his wife and newborn son.
“We are so relieved Mahmoud is finally out of his cruel, remote detention, but equally outraged that it took this long and that Mahmoud had to fight this hard to challenge such outrageous and unconstitutional government conduct,” said Baher Azmy, legal director for the Center for Constitutional Rights. “All Americans should be grateful that Mahmoud had the fortitude to defend basic First Amendment principles – and his pursuit of justice for Palestinians – against the administration’s autocratic tactics, which threaten us all.”
Judge Michael Farbiarz’s ruling comes one week after he ordered Khalil’s release but allowed federal prosecutors to ask the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to weigh in. Instead, federal authorities refused the judge’s order to release Khalil, a former Columbia University student, claiming Khalil could still be held under a federal statute allowing immigrants to be detained during removal proceedings.
The judge instead confirmed in a virtual hearing Friday that Khalil should be released as soon a separate judge sets bail conditions. Khalil would be required to surrender his passport to the government as part of the bail agreement, that judge ordered Friday afternoon.

The bail conditions should not include electronic monitoring because there is “no basis for that” in the record, Farbiarz said.
Abigail Jackson, a spokeswoman for the White House, said the Trump administration expects to be “vindicated” when it appeals Friday’s order and that federal officials “look forward to removing Khalil from the United States.”
“Mahmoud Khalil was given the privilege of coming to America to study on a student visa he obtained by fraud and misrepresentation. While in the United States, Khalil has consistently engaged in conduct detrimental to American foreign policy interests. Khalil is thus removable twice over. And in any event, there is no basis for a local federal judge in New Jersey — who lacks jurisdiction — to order Khalil’s release from a detention facility in Louisiana,” she said.
Khalil, who was born in Syria, was among the first wave of arrests after President Donald Trump targeted students involved in pro-Palestinian efforts across college campuses amid the war in Gaza. Khalil was arrested by federal authorities near his New York City apartment and transferred through the Elizabeth Detention Center — where he was located when his attorneys filed a petition for his release — before eventually ending up in Louisiana.
His attorneys have argued for the last three months that he was unfairly targeted and held for deportation over his advocacy for his pro-Palestinian advocacy. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Khalil’s presence could have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”
Farbiarz had previously ruled that while the government couldn’t deport Khalil on those grounds — the government cited a rarely used statute the judge said is likely unconstitutional as applied to Khalil — they could pursue the case based on allegations of fraud on his green card application. That means Khalil’s proceedings aren’t over, and he still faces deportation.
Noor Abdalla, Khalil’s wife, said Friday that after three months, her family can “finally breathe a sigh of relief.”
“We know this ruling does not begin to address the injustices the Trump administration has brought upon our family, and so many others the government is trying to silence for speaking out against Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians,” she said in a statement. “But today we are celebrating Mahmoud coming back to New York to be reunited with our little family, and the community that has supported us since the day he was unjustly taken for speaking out for Palestinian freedom.”

Shane Khoury appear before the House Agriculture, Forestry and Economic Development committee on April 10, 2025 to speak in favor of Senate Bill 290, which preserved the existing Buffalo River watershed permit moratorium. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)After 13 years, large-scale swine farms are banned — permanently — within the Buffalo River watershed, ending a saga that started when Arkansas environmental regulators quietly approved a general water permit for C&H Hog Farms in 2012.
The Arkansas Legislative Council reviewed and approved the regulations containing the so-called permit moratorium during its Friday meeting without discussion. It marked the culmination of over a decade of efforts from environmental advocates and their allies to prevent a similar large-scale swine farm, known as concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) from taking root in the watershed. The moratorium specifically applies to medium and large swine CAFOs that meet the Environmental Protection Agency’s definition.
It’s also the end of a year-long battle that began when the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment began updating Rule 6, which regulates the Division of Environmental Quality’s issuance of federal water permits under the Clean Water Act. A temporary moratorium had been contained in the language of Rule 6 since 2014.
But the language of the temporary moratorium required DEQ to either move to make the prohibition permanent after five years or similarly take the measure out of the rule. 
DEQ went with the first option in 2020. But the ALC voted down the moratorium after legislators expressed concerns about the impact on agriculture.
The temporary moratorium stayed on the books. 
In 2023, the legislature transferred the authority to issue other state permits for liquid animal waste systems from DEQ to the Arkansas Department of Agriculture. Rule 5 permits, as they are known, are “no-discharge” permits, which prohibits permit-holders from discharging anything into state waters — and they also contained the Buffalo River watershed permit moratorium.
Last summer, DEQ again unveiled proposed changes to Rule 6 that included making the permit moratorium permanent. A little while later, the Department of Agriculture released its proposed version of Rule 5, which also included permit moratorium language.
The proposals were instantly controversial, and each one received hundreds of public comments. The battle lines were relatively clear — on one side were those who had been fighting for the moratorium since the now-shuttered C&H Hog Farms opened its doors in 2013. Moratorium supporters worried about how the waste from such operations could impact the water quality of America’s first national river. On the other side, the Arkansas Farm Bureau and other agriculture supporters argued that such a moratorium would hurt the state’s largest industry and infringe on property rights.

Arkansas Farm Bureau decried DEQ’s efforts for infringing on the “right to farm” in written comments submitting to the division as part of the rulemaking process. They said the number of swine farms in the area has “precipitously declined” since the 1990s. Meanwhile, nitrate concentrations in the watershed have increased, they said.
“Obviously, something other than agriculture, particularly swine farms, is affecting the perception, albeit unfounded, that there is an impact on the Buffalo River as its water quality remains extremely high,” the Farm Bureau’s Evan Teague wrote.
Segments of the Buffalo River and Big Creek, which is part of the watershed, are on the state environmental agency’s impaired waterbodies list for not meeting e. Coli standards. While no specific source of the bacteria is cited, DEQ said in one of the reports accompanying the list, which it cited in its responses to the Farm Bureau’s comments, that swine farming could be a contributing factor.
In its response to Arkansas Farm Bureau’s comments opposing the moratorium, DEQ said science and the history of the watershed supported the prohibition.
“The Division does not concur with Commenter’s conclusion regarding the history of swine farms in the Buffalo River Watershed,” the division wrote in its response. “The potential impacts of swine farms … on the Buffalo River has been an ongoing concern in Arkansas.”
The proposed rules were pulled from the Legislative Council’s agenda in December. During the 2025 legislative session, some lawmakers sought to repeal the moratorium via legislation and prohibit DEQ and other agencies from putting in place similar moratoriums going forward. After pushback — and the involvement of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders — the bill was changed in the final days of the session to explicitly protect the existing moratorium in its current form, while putting into place hoops that agencies would have to jump through to get a similar ban in place going forward.
What started with a bang ended with a whisper — there was no discussion about the moratorium during the Rules Subcommittee meeting on Thursday, nor during the ALC meeting on Friday.

The 5th U.S. Court of Appeals, often cited as one of the most conservative courts in the nation, found the law unconstitutional because it violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which bars the government from endorsing a religion or creating laws that favor one religion over another.
The decision upholds a lower court’s injunction that blocked the law from taking effect in five of Louisiana’s K-12 school districts after families with students in those districts sued the state last year. The injunction applies only to the districts where those plaintiffs live.
The legal battle began in June 2024 when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law a bill requiring every school in Louisiana to display posters with a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments.
The appeals court wrote that “under the statute’s minimum requirements, the [Ten Commandments] posters must be indiscriminately displayed in every public school classroom in Louisiana regardless of class subject-matter,” and thus, if allowed to go up, “those displays will cause an ‘irreparable’ deprivation of [the Plaintiffs’] First Amendment rights.”
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, also a Republican, said she intends to seek a review from the full 5th Circuit and, if necessary, turn to the U.S. Supreme Court.

USC has signed a $1.5 million agreement with OpenAI to offer CharGPT to all students and faculty. (File/Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s largest university system has signed a $1.5 million agreement with OpenAI to offer free AI tools to all students and faculty beginning this fall.
USC’s Columbia campus will become the first in the state to offer access to ChatGPT, following approval of a software licensing agreement by the college’s governing board Friday. The university system’s other campuses throughout the state also will have the option to join.
The school plans to use the technology to train students on ethical and appropriate use of AI, said spokesman Jeff Stensland. USC envisions students will use ChatGPT to create study guides for their classes or to help with time management, a skill Stensland said students often struggle with, by automating any busy work on their to do lists.
The sole-source contract is for one year, starting with the fall semester. Stensland was unsure why the contract didn’t go through the normal procurement process.
“AI is here and people in the private sector are using for whole host of things,” Stensland said. “This will position students to know how to use these tools responsibly.”
Students will be expected to abide by all policies for student conduct and academic integrity in their use of the technology.
USC also expects ChatGPT will be a time saver for faculty in the classroom, automating grading or creating syllabi, or with data analysis in research.
By having a licensing agreement for the technology, USC also will benefit from greater cyber security, protecting any data or information they use the tool for.
“The campus-wide adoption of secure enterprise AI technology puts USC on the leading edge of higher education institutions,” said Brice Bible, USC’s vice president for information technology and chief information officer. “This initiative will not only make our students more employable, but it will allow for much greater innovation in the classroom and across research teams in every discipline.”
The school plans to provide more information on the program throughout the summer.
“ChatGPT as a tool is one outcome. The larger goal is to adopt training, build operational efficiencies, advance the institution’s understanding of AI and build guardrails to experiment and protect USC data,” Stensland said in a statement.
USC is not the only university leaning into advancements in AI. OpenAI invested $50 million in a partnership, which it calls the NextGenAI consortium, to help speed up the research process.
College partners in the consortium include:

Neronha said in a statement.Appropriations powerMcConnell seemed likely during a Wednesday hearing to block the Transportation Department’s move to withdraw billions in congressional funding.McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011, pressed acting U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom on how the Transportation Department could have power over funding that was approved by Congress, saying federal agencies “only have appropriations power given by Congress.”“That's how the Constitution works,” he said. “Where does the secretary get the power and authority to impose immigration conditions on transportation funding?”The suit brought by 20 Democratic state attorneys general challenges an April directive from Duffy, a former House member from Wisconsin, that requires states to cooperate in federal immigration enforcement in order to receive federal grants already approved by Congress.“Defendents seek to hold hostage tens of billions of dollars of critical transportation funding in order to force the plaintiff states to become mere arms of the federal government's immigration enforcement policies,” Delbert Tran of the California Department of Justice, who argued on behalf of the states, said.Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Bloom said that Duffy’s letter simply directs the states to follow federal immigration law.McConnell said that while the states could interpret it that way, the Trump administration has gone after so-called sanctuary cities and targeted them for not taking the same aggressive immigration enforcement as the administration.The judge said Bloom’s argument expressed a “very different” interpretation of the directive than how the administration has described it publicly. He also noted President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have “railed on … the issues that arise from sanctuary cities.”Trump on June 15  directed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to target Chicago, Los Angeles and New York — three major Democrat-led cities that have policies to not aid in immigration enforcement.Undermines CongressTran said the Department of Transportation’s directive is not only arbitrary and capricious, but undermines congressional authority because Congress appropriated more than $100 billion for transportation projects to the states.Cutting off funding would have disastrous consequences, the states have argued.“More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States,” according to the brief from the states.Bloom defended Duffy’s letter, saying it listed actions that would impede federal law enforcement and justified withholding of funds because “such actions compromise the safety and security of the transportation systems supported by DOT financial assistance.”McConnell said that didn’t answer his question about the secretary’s authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funding.“It seems to me that the secretary is saying that a failure to comply with immigration conditions is relevant to the safety and security of the transportation system,” Bloom said.",,,,2025-06-20 17:04:03.610962

(Photo courtesy of Community College of Rhode Island) The new permanent president of the Community College of Rhode Island’s (CCRI) is the same person who’s been leading the institution for the past two years. 
The Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education voted unanimously Wednesday to confirm Rosemary Costigan as sixth permanent president of the state’s only public community college. The council oversees public higher education in the Ocean State,
Costigan is the first CCRI graduate to lead the institution, and the second woman president following her predecessor Meghan Hughes, who left the post in 2023, when Costigan was named interim president. She outpaced 43 other candidates and one other finalist to secure the permanent post after a roughly five-month search.
“Dr. Costigan is a deeply experienced administrator with decades of teaching experience who as interim president has provided strong and visionary leadership through this difficult post-COVID era,” David Caprio, chair of the Postsecondary Council, said in a statement Wednesday. “The caliber of the candidates overall was impressive, but Dr. Costigan stood out as the best person suited to lead the college now.”
Gov. Dan McKee also congratulated Costigan on Wednesday. 
“This is a great day for higher education in our state,” McKee said in a statement. “Dr. Costigan is a graduate of CCRI, taught nursing students for years, led the nursing department, and rose to the highest level as interim president. She knows CCRI inside and out, and I’m confident she will continue to elevate CCRI, its faculty and its students.”
In her 18 months of presidency, Costigan led the school through its once-in-a-decade accreditation process. She launched the CCRI Advantage program to help students with developmental needs complete math and English requirements, along with new course initiatives in hospitality, culinary arts and apprenticeship programs to help rebuild enrollment amid pandemic-era declines. During her leadership, the three-year graduation rate has doubled to 30%, and fall to spring retention rose from 80 to 85%.  
Prior to her interim appointment, Costigan taught nursing at CCRI and the University of Rhode Island (URI). At CCRI, she advanced from an associate professor of nursing to nursing department chairperson, later assistant dean and finally vice president of academic affairs.  
Costigan also worked as a full-time nurse at Memorial Hospital for 21 years.   
Before becoming an educator, Costigan studied at each of Rhode Island’s public institutions of higher learning. She earned her Ph.D. and master;s degree in nursing from URI, while her bachelor’s in nursing came from Rhode Island College. Her associate’s degree in nursing came from CCRI.
Costigan’s contract, salary and official start date will be determined in the coming weeks, according to a CCRI news release.

Tracey Mann, R-Kansas, said it was important to prevent Iran from securing nuclear weapons and defended his vote for a GOP-crafted House bill that controversially delved into budgets, immigration, agriculture and the social safety net. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann of Kansas said Friday the nation ought to get behind President Donald Trump’s ultimate decision on whether to authorize military strikes to interrupt Iran’s development of nuclear weapons.
The Trump administration said a determination could be made within two weeks about deployment of sophisticated weapons aimed at dismantling Iran’s nuclear sites. Meanwhile, Israel and Iran continued to exchange barrages in a weeklong shooting conflict.
“Under no circumstance should Iran be allowed to have a nuclear weapon,” Mann said in an interview. “President Trump has always been clear that his goal is to attain American peace through strength. We need to support our president on whatever his decision is.”
Mann wasn’t the only member of the Kansas delegation drawn to the clash between Iran and Israel.
“Iran should not have nuclear capabilities,” said U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican serving the Wichita region. “They are a state sponsor of terrorism and a threat to the Middle East and the entire world.”
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, said he was confident Trump was examining different sides of the question. He said he hoped Israel could finish the job without direct involvement of the United States.
“What we’re hoping to see over there is a regime change as well and end this terrorist organization,” Marshall said. “I know philosophically President Trump is not going to get us into another endless war.”
 
The big bill
Mann, who serves the large 1st District stretching from Dodge City in the west to Lawrence in the east, said the House and Senate was intent on passing a massive bill featuring tax cuts, investment in border security and deportation of people in the country illegally, modernization of air traffic control systems, expansion of agriculture programs and reform of the social safety net.
“If we fail to pass this bill the average Kansas family will face a tax hike of $2,200 in January,” Mann said. “That’s the last thing Kansas families need after four years of level records of inflation.”
Mann objected to the latest projection from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that budget legislation passed last month by the House and undergoing vetting by the Senate could increase federal deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade. The CBO produced a dynamic analysis that took into account how the economy could adjust to changes in revenue and spending.
Mann said the CBO’s estimate of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act underestimated economic growth tied to tax reductions. In 2022, he said, CBO said the Inflation Reduction Act would lower the deficit by $238 billion. That was revised in 2024 to indicate it could boost the deficit.
In addition, he said economic assumptions related to implementation of the pending “big, beautiful bill” were too modest.
“I believe once it’s passed the economic growth will exceed expectations as President Trump has done in the first five months of his presidency,” Mann said.
Mann said the Senate shouldn’t make broad changes to the House version because “I was really happy with what we passed.”
 
Farm economy
Mann said he had heard concern among Kansas farmers about Trump’s tariff and immigration policies disrupting the agriculture economy. Trump has been criticized by baffled business owners for the on-again, off-again targeting of immigrant labor on farms. There have been calls to exempt agriculture from Trump’s immigration crackdown.
Mann said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel were focused on deporting individuals with a violent background.
“No one loves America’s farmers, ranchers and ag producers more than President Trump,” Mann said. “America has the safest, most secure food supply in the world and this administration is working around the clock to ensure that we further strengthen the farm economy.”
Assertions tax provisions in the House bill excessively rewarded billionaires while making life difficult for lower-income individuals were misplaced, Mann said. He said the bill featured the largest tax cut for middle-class families in U.S. history and eliminated income taxes on overtime and tips, reduced taxes on Social Security and expanded the child tax credit.
“I’ve never met a billionaire who is counting on overtime pay, living off of Social Security or banking on tips to make ends meet so I just reject that notion,” Mann said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tracey-Mann-with-chamber-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-20 17:04:03.610962

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)A federal judge in New Jersey on Friday ordered the government to immediately release a pro-Palestinian activist from the Louisiana immigration detention center where he’s been held since March 9. 
Attorneys for the activist, Mahmoud Khalil, said that after more than three months of fighting his detainment and potential deportation, Khalil can be reunited with his wife and newborn son. 
“We are so relieved Mahmoud is finally out of his cruel, remote detention, but equally outraged that it took this long and that Mahmoud had to fight this hard to challenge such outrageous and unconstitutional government conduct,” said Baher Azmy, legal director for the Center for Constitutional Rights. “All Americans should be grateful that Mahmoud had the fortitude to defend basic First Amendment principles – and his pursuit of justice for Palestinians – against the administration’s autocratic tactics, which threaten us all.”
Judge Michael Farbiarz’s ruling comes one week after he ordered Khalil’s release but allowed federal prosecutors to ask the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to weigh in. Instead, federal authorities refused the judge’s order to release Khalil, a former Columbia University student, claiming Khalil could still be held under a federal statute allowing immigrants to be detained during removal proceedings. 
The judge instead confirmed in a virtual hearing Friday that Khalil should be released as soon a separate judge sets bail conditions. Khalil would be required to surrender his passport to the government as part of the bail agreement, that judge ordered Friday afternoon.
The bail conditions should not include electronic monitoring because there is “no basis for that” in the record, Farbiarz said.
Abigail Jackson, a spokeswoman for the White House, said the Trump administration expects to be “vindicated” when it appeals Friday’s order and that federal officials “look forward to removing Khalil from the United States.”
“Mahmoud Khalil was given the privilege of coming to America to study on a student visa he obtained by fraud and misrepresentation. While in the United States, Khalil has consistently engaged in conduct detrimental to American foreign policy interests. Khalil is thus removable twice over. And in any event, there is no basis for a local federal judge in New Jersey — who lacks jurisdiction — to order Khalil’s release from a detention facility in Louisiana,” she said.
Khalil, who was born in Syria, was among the first wave of arrests after President Donald Trump targeted students involved in pro-Palestinian efforts across college campuses amid the war in Gaza. Khalil was arrested by federal authorities near his New York City apartment and transferred through the Elizabeth Detention Center — where he was located when his attorneys filed a petition for his release — before eventually ending up in Louisiana. 
His attorneys have argued for the last three months that he was unfairly targeted and held for deportation over his advocacy for his pro-Palestinian advocacy. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Khalil’s presence could have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”
Farbiarz had previously ruled that while the government couldn’t deport Khalil on those grounds — the government cited a rarely used statute the judge said is likely unconstitutional as applied to Khalil — they could pursue the case based on allegations of fraud on his green card application. That means Khalil’s proceedings aren’t over, and he still faces deportation.
Noor Abdalla, Khalil’s wife, said Friday that after three months, her family can “finally breathe a sigh of relief.”
“We know this ruling does not begin to address the injustices the Trump administration has brought upon our family, and so many others the government is trying to silence for speaking out against Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians,” she said in a statement. “But today we are celebrating Mahmoud coming back to New York to be reunited with our little family, and the community that has supported us since the day he was unjustly taken for speaking out for Palestinian freedom.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Governor Josh Stein issued the first vetoes of his administration on Friday, rejecting a trio of controversial measures sent to him by the General Assembly last week.
Permitless concealed carry
Senate Bill 50 would allow North Carolinians over 18 to carry concealed firearms without applying for a permit. The measure, branded “constitutional carry” by conservative backers, is law in 29 other states. The Senate approved the bill on a partisan, 26-18 vote, with all Republicans voting ‘yes’ and all Democrats voting ‘no.’ Six members were absent. In the House, the vote was 59-48, with two Republicans — Reps. William Brisson (R-Bladen) and Ted Davis (R-New Hanover) — joining Democrats in opposition. If Brisson and Davis remain opposed, it could make it much harder for Republicans to must the necessary three-fifths vote to override the veto.
In announcing his veto, Stein said:

        “This bill makes North Carolinians less safe and undermines responsible gun ownership. Therefore, I am vetoing it. The bill eliminates training requirements associated with concealed carry permits and reduces the age to carry a concealed weapon from 21 to 18 years old. Authorizing teenagers to carry a concealed weapon with no training whatsoever is dangerous. The bill would also make the job of a law enforcement officer more difficult and less safe. We can and should protect the right to bear arms without recklessly endangering law enforcement officers and our people.”     
 
The veto announcement also noted that the action had the support Sheriffs Charles Blackwood of Orange County and Clarence Birkhead of Durham County.
Immigration enforcement
Senate Bill 153 would require state agencies to sign agreements cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). It also bars undocumented immigrants from receiving state-funded benefits, and opens local government “sanctuaries” to lawsuits in crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The bill passed the House 60-46 (with 14 members absent) and the Senate 26-17 (with seven members absent). In each case, all ‘yes’ votes were from Republicans and all ‘no’ votes were cast by Democratic members.
According to Stein:

        “Senate Bill 153 would also make us less safe, so I am vetoing this legislation. At a time when our law enforcement is already stretched thin, this bill takes state law enforcement officers away from their existing state duties and forces them to act as federal immigration agents. Furthermore, under current law, people without lawful immigration status already are prevented from receiving Medicaid, SNAP, Section 8, and other benefits.”     
 
And House Bill 318 aims to close what Republicans have called a “loophole” in a 2024 law requiring local sheriffs to cooperate with ICE “detainer” requests. As with Senate Bill 153, the bill was, with one exception in the House (Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg), approved on exclusively partisan votes.
Stein said the bill is unconstitutional.

“I am vetoing House Bill 318 because it is unconstitutional. I support the bill’s efforts to require sheriffs to contact federal immigration authorities about people in their custody charged with sexual battery, armed robbery, arson, assault on public officials and court personnel, and other dangerous crimes. People who commit these crimes should be held accountable, whether or not they are here without legal authorization, and those charged with serious offenses ought to receive increased scrutiny from federal immigration officials.
“My oath of office requires that I uphold the Constitution of the United States. Therefore, I cannot sign this bill because it would require sheriffs to unconstitutionally detain people for up to 48 hours after they would otherwise be released. The Fourth Circuit is clear that local law enforcement officers cannot keep people in custody solely based on a suspected immigration violation. But let me be clear: anyone who commits a serious crime in North Carolina must be prosecuted and held accountable regardless of their immigration status.”     
As with the permitless concealed carry legislation, Stein’s veto messages on the immigration enforcement bills included statements from county sheriffs — as well as a law professor, a farmer and a family physician — endorsing the action.
GOP-led legislature can override Stein’s vetoes, but path is narrow
In recent years, legislative reversals on the governor’s vetoes have been routine. Republicans held enough seats in both chambers of the General Assembly to easily override vetoes from Stein’s predecessor, Gov. Roy Cooper.
But Democrats were able to claw back enough House seats in last November’s election to deny the GOP a veto-proof majority — by one vote.
That means a simple party-line vote is no longer enough to force a law into effect. Republicans will have to flip a Democratic vote for a successful override, assuming all members are present. (Senate Republicans maintain a precise (30-20) veto-proof majority.)
Still, flipping a vote in that scenario remains a possibility. Rep. Cecil Brockman (D-Guilford), who has accused his party of “attacking” him after prior votes, is one such member who could flip.
House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) frequently refers to a “working supermajority” when he describes the voting margins in the chamber. It remains to be seen whether that holds up when override motions reach the floor.
In a statement, Hall blasted the veto of House Bill 318:

        “Governor Stein has made one thing clear today: he stands with criminal illegal aliens and the most radical elements of his party’s base over the safety and security of North Carolinians. Make no mistake, the NC House will override the Governor’s veto at the earliest opportunity.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2163-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 17:04:03.610962

The post Wyoming Public Media backers urge congressional delegation to defend funding appeared first on WyoFile .","After a judge on June 8 affirmed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s independence, a funding fight with President Donald Trump is now beginning in the Senate, where $1.1 billion in broadcasting appropriations are on the line.
Because Wyoming Public Media is funded in part by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the organization’s supporters are urging Wyoming’s congressional delegation to vote against an effort to claw back funds. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee is preparing to debate the administration’s plan to take back CPB money and another $8.2 billion in already appropriated funds, perhaps as soon as Wednesday. Congress funded CPB, which distributes grants to independent public broadcasters and National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, with $1.1 billion through the end of September 2027.
Republican U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman has voted for a rescissions bill to take back the money. Wyoming Public Media backers recently urged U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, both Republicans, to vote against the rescission and preserve federal funding for public radio and television broadcasting in Wyoming and nationwide.
“[Listeners] deserve strong public broadcasting that is free from political influence.” Christina Kuzmych
“We recognize that you and others may not agree with some National Public Radio programming,” Casper’s Maggi Murdock, chair of the Wyoming Public Media Public Advisory Council, wrote to the senators. “[B]ut we hope you will have the foresight and thoughtful care for the many Wyoming residents who rely on Wyoming Public Media as one of their vital sources of information and as a foundation for a statewide community.”
Murdock’s fellow board members also signed the letter. Barrasso and Lummis appear unmoved.
“I am troubled by the recent trend of publicly funded media promoting political agendas,” Lummis wrote in response Wednesday, according to a copy of her letter posted by Wyoming Public Media. Lummis added that she was “working with my colleagues on ways that we can hold public media accountable.”
“Hard-earned taxpayer dollars should not be spent promoting far-left climate policies or woke agendas,” Barrasso replied.
Respect for listeners
General Manager Christina Kuzmych said 50,000 people listen to Wyoming Public Media each week. The radio station, like more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations across the country, receives CPB support. It also subscribes to NPR, another recipient of the corporation’s grants, for news programs.
“WPM respects the work our legislators perform as they serve the many interests of Wyoming voters,” she said in a statement. Yet listeners deserve respect too, she said.
“They bring many diverse viewpoints to their listening experience, and they deserve strong public broadcasting that is free from political influence,” Kuzmych wrote.
A judge affirmed that independence after the CPB board, chaired by Ruby Calvert, a retired 35-plus-year veteran of Wyoming Public Broadcasting in Riverton, sued Trump and his administration in April. The administration had emailed three CPB board members saying they were fired, leading the congressionally funded, independent organization to defend itself in court.
Trump himself characterized federally funded public media as “trash,” “madness,” “biased,” “radical” and “woke propaganda disguised as news.”
CPB sought a preliminary injunction to prevent Trump from dismantling the organization, which Congress designed to be free from political meddling. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss on June 8 denied the corporation’s request for a preliminary injunction, saying in essence that it could continue to operate despite the administration’s attacks. But Moss certified CPB’s independence.
“Congress intended to preclude the President (or any subordinate officials acting at his direction) from directing, supervising, or controlling the Corporation,” Moss wrote. The judge was open to CPB “renewing their motion should Defendants [Trump and those acting in concert with him] take steps to interfere in the independence of the Corporation.”
With that decision, Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the corporation, affirmed that the three targeted board members are still governing.
“Laura G. Ross, Thomas E. Rothman, and Diane Kaplan, are, remain, and shall continue to be directors of the Board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” according to a CPB statement.

The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in US v. Skrmetti, a case about Tennessee's law banning gender-affirming care for minors and if it violates the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
Conservative justices lean toward allowing Tennessee’s ban on gender affirming care

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
How to stay or when to move? Transgender laws force tough choices on Tennessee families

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

Jeff Landry signed a bill into law Wednesday that lets local law enforcement officers “neutralize” any drones operating in a “nefarious manner,” such as flying over a parade route. 
House Bill 261 by Rep. Jay Gallé, R-Mandeville, passed both chambers of the Louisiana Legislature with unanimous support.  
According to the new law, officers can neutralize, intercept or disable drones through any legal and safe methods – including but not limited to jamming, hacking or physical capture – to prevent illegal or harmful activity. 
The new law, called the “We Will Act” Act, states officers can take such actions only if there is reasonable suspicion the drone is involved in criminal activity, poses an imminent threat to public safety or is otherwise operating in violation of state or federal law. 
“The new law does not explicitly authorize the shooting down of drones but does provide the use of discretion for law enforcement to mitigate unlawful drones, provided those measures are safe to life and property,” Gallé said in a text message Friday. 
The law, which takes effect Aug. 1, restricts the flying of drones over parade routes and requires local authorities to post notices establishing “Drone No Fly Zone” along those routes. The restriction does not apply to drone operators who have permission to film the parade. 
Any violation of the parade route restriction carries a minimum fine of $2,000 and up to one year in prison. 
“This law puts Louisiana on the front lines of drone defense,” the governor said in a press release. “We are taking bold steps now to protect our people and our skies before tragedy strikes.”
Drone pilots currently rely on Federal Aviation Administration notices about airspace restrictions. 
Mikon Haaksman, a professional drone videographer in Shreveport, said his business is very strict in following the federal laws and has some worries about local law enforcement trying to govern the same airspace. 
“I think for the most part it’s a good idea, but I have concerns on how much knowledge these officers will have on actual laws and could make judgement calls not based on the law or safety but because they feel it’s the right thing to do,” Haaksman said. “But I do see much too often people who fly drones unsafe or illegally and that can be a problem. Like any law, it has its pros and cons.”

In a decision released this week, a Tulsa federal judge determined poultry farm runoff in eastern Oklahoma is still harming the Illinois River, Lake Tenkiller and connected waterways. U.S. District Judge Gregory K. Frizzell found that “conditions have not materially changed in the Illinois River Watershed” since the lawsuit went to trial in 2010.
Drummond’s past attempts at mediation with poultry producers broke down, as the corporations alleged that phosphorus levels causing the pollution had significantly reduced, the Attorney General’s Office said.
Evidentiary hearings Frizzell hosted in December led to his conclusion on Tuesday that poultry waste is still causing unnaturally high phosphorus levels in Illinois River waterways, building up algae and worsening water quality.
Frizzell ruled in 2023 that poultry companies, including Tyson Foods, are responsible for elevated phosphorus levels that had been recorded in the past in the Illinois River. The Attorney General’s Office presented more recent information and data during the December evidentiary hearings.

The judge could enter a final decision in the case before the end of the year, Drummond said. That decision likely would order the corporations to immediately stop spreading poultry waste on the land in the Illinois River Watershed area, he said, and the companies are likely to file an appeal.
While those decisions are pending, the attorney general said he intends to negotiate. Drummond said he is open to a settlement that would give poultry producers a several-year runway to remove the pollutants.
Such an agreement could protect the poultry industry’s profits while also restoring the watershed, he said.
“I don’t think that they’re mutually exclusive,” Drummond told Oklahoma Voice. “My objective in the end is we continue to have a vibrant poultry industry in Oklahoma and we have a path through which the watershed is rehabilitated and healed.”
Former Attorney General Drew Edmondson filed the lawsuit in 2005. A 2010 trial resulted in court-ordered mediation between the state and the corporations to determine remedies for the pollution. In the years since, negotiations failed to result in an agreement. The corporations sought to have the case dismissed.
Gov. Kevin Stitt has said he is “100% against” using a lawsuit to force poultry companies to change their policies. Stitt has been a vocal critic of the case, calling it an attempt “to get a pound of flesh” out of poultry businesses that he said had been following the law.
He even fired his secretary of energy and environment last year for attending the December evidentiary hearings in Frizzell’s courtroom.
Stitt’s office did not return a request for comment Friday on the judge’s recent ruling.

In an April news conference, the governor said improving the Illinois River Watershed would be better accomplished through legislation or through action from the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. 
He signed a bill into law last year that protects poultry companies from future lawsuits as long as they are complying with a state-approved waste disposal plan.
Drummond, a Republican candidate running to succeed Stitt as governor, said the new law won’t have any bearing on the Illinois River case, but “it illustrates how effective and powerful the poultry lobby is on Oklahoma legislators.” 
The attorney general said he hopes to resolve the 20-year-long lawsuit during his tenure in office. So far, he said, the corporations have shown more interest in litigating than reaching a final resolution. 
“I think every year that they can delay, that’s just additional profits that they can enjoy, and that’s disappointing,” Drummond said. “I wish that they would recognize, say, ‘We’re the cause of the watershed’s deterioration, and we should self-police and can coordinate with the state on a path through which we remove the pollutants in the watershed and give Mother Nature an opportunity to heal herself.’”

,DC,2025-06-20 19:43:07+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration move to restore gun rights to some convicts protested by Democrats,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-move-restore-gun-rights-some-convicts-protested-democrats,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration's decision to restore 10 convicts’ ability to legally purchase firearms and explosives violated the law, according to a letter six high-ranking congressional Democrats released Friday.The Justice Department publication of an interim final rule moving the authority to restore some convicts' gun rights from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to the attorney general also violated the separation of powers and a decades-old provision in the department’s annual funding bill, according to the 12-page letter.The Democrats wrote that while Congress did delegate the authority to “oversee restoration of federal firearm privileges applications” to the ATF several decades ago, lawmakers have included language in nearly every government funding bill since 1993 barring the ATF from spending any money to process those applications.The prohibition followed then-President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, trying to move the authority from the ATF to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.“Given the pervasiveness of gun violence in our nation, this Administration should not be circumventing Congress’ authority to prioritize restoring firearm privileges to individuals convicted of serious or violent crimes,” the Democrats wrote.The letter was signed by House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.; Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash.; House Judiciary ranking member Jamie Raskin, D-Md.; Senate Judiciary ranking member Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; House Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee ranking member Grace Meng, D-N.Y.; and Senate Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee ranking member Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment from States Newsroom.Mel Gibson caseThe DOJ under President Donald Trump has so far restored 10 individuals’ ability to legally purchase firearms, including the actor Mel Gibson, who “pleaded no contest to a charge of domestic violence” in 2011, according to Reuters.Federal law bars several types of people from legally buying firearms, including anyone sentenced to more than one year in prison, which typically coincides with felonies, and those who commit domestic violence.The six Democrats wrote that the “intersection between firearms and domestic violence remains a key concern, demonstrating the need to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.“Research has shown that the presence of firearms significantly increases the risk of death or serious injury for victims of domestic or dating violence. The Supreme Court has recognized that the danger of a domestic abuser with a gun serves as a limitation on the Second Amendment.” The Democrats wrote that for decades Congress has prevented the ATF from restoring prohibited people’s ability to legally purchase firearms. The annual DOJ appropriations bill also bars moving the ability to approve those applications away from ATF to any other federal agency. “The concerns that originally led to these provisions — recidivist crime, limited investigative resources, and difficulty in assessing applicants — remain unchanged,” they wrote. “Congress made an explicit policy choice to prioritize investigating crime, rather than to waste funds on evaluating whether to restore firearm rights to previously convicted felons.”Study citedThe letter says a study from the Violence Policy Center that looked at restorations during the late 1980s is one of many reasons Congress prohibited the ATF from restoring some felons' ability to legally purchase firearms.The study, which reviewed 100 ATF case files obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, showed the federal government had restored the ability of “terrorists, murderers, rapists, drug dealers, gun traffickers, and child molesters” to legally purchase firearms and explosives.“The FOIA-obtained records also showed that of those granted relief between 1985 and 1989, 47 individuals were later re-arrested for serious offenses such as attempted murder, first-degree sexual assault, kidnapping, child molestation, illegal possession of a machine gun, trafficking in cocaine, LSD, and PCP, and illegal firearms possession or carrying,” they wrote.The letter ends with Democrats calling on the DOJ to withdraw the interim final rule and “vacate the wrongfully granted restoration of federal firearms privileges to the 10 individuals.”",,,,2025-06-20 16:07:18.441030

BURLINGTON — City property taxes are set to rise more than expected due to a $1.8 million budgeting error, Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said this week — though she noted the increase could be offset by a drop in education taxes. 
In the mayor’s initial $106.6 million budget — first presented to the Board of Finance on June 2 — property taxes were expected to increase by just $35, or less than 1%, over the current year. Three days later, however, Mulvaney-Stanak said a $1.8 million gap was discovered, stemming from an overestimation of tax revenue from commercial properties and a miscommunication between the Clerk/Treasurer Office and the Assessor’s Office.
To close the gap, the mayor said the city’s property taxes would instead have to increase by around $100 per year, or 2.5%, on a $500,000 home, bringing in around $831,000 in revenue. 
Mulvaney-Stanak said most property owners will still experience an overall tax decrease in fiscal year 2025-26 due to a projected drop in the education tax rate.
“That was something that was, again, important to me so that, at the end of the day, people had a more affordable bill,” Mulvaney Stanak said during a Tuesday press conference at City Hall. 
Burlington School District’s Executive Director of Finance and Operations Nathan Lavery said the city’s education budget is expected to decrease by 4.5%, or about $360 on a $500,000 house.
Mulvaney-Stanak also said she would not receive a cost-of-living salary increase in fiscal year 2026, and other department heads would not receive it for six months. 
“This is a very hard decision because my department heads work incredibly hard for this city,” she said. “This is why in six months I want to restore the 3% [cost of living adjustment] that we were originally budgeting for fiscal year [20]26 for department heads.”
The budget error also means that new roles — including a deputy city attorney and a housing-related position — will be put on hold, and the upcoming police academy class will be cut from four recruits to two. These reductions come on top of the 25 positions already cut across various city departments.

“That is important for us to actually structurally start to fix our budget because if we continue to have more employees than we could really financially sustain, that continues to make that gap grow over years,” she said.
Other expected revenue sources include a 25-cent tax increase for Uber and Lyft rides, $250,000 in anticipated development permits fees, and an estimated $200,000 from the hotel occupancy tax tied to a new hotel opening in downtown Burlington. 
The mayor also highlighted two budget revisions: the restoration of $100,000 for UVM Health Network Home Health & Hospice and an adult programming position in the Parks, Recreation & Waterfront Department.
Mulvaney-Stanak said she is committed to transparency and informed Democratic and Progressive city counselors of the budget error on the same day it was discovered. To prevent similar errors from happening in the future, the mayor said the Clerk/Treasurer Office and the Assessor’s Office will create new procedures to outline the process for submitting grand list figures, and the City Assessor’s Office will move under the Department of Finance and Administration starting July 1.
Final budget numbers have not yet been determined. 
“The administration is still working with City Council on a revised budget that identifies exactly how much of the $1.8 million will be in new revenues versus cut expenses,” Burlington Chief Administrative Officer Katherine Schad told VTDigger. 
The budget may evolve slightly after consultations with city councilors. “I’m confident that we’re going to have an agreement with the City Council, both the Progressive caucus and Democratic caucus,” Mulvaney-Stanak said.

The private university announced in a news release its law school received the donation from the Sease & Wadding Law Firm as part of an almost $4.2 million settlement between the State of Iowa and a sibling of Sabrina Ray. Funds will go to the Children’s Rights Clinic, a semester-long course in which students participate in children’s advocacy and representation in different court settings, with faculty supervision.

Two initiatives will be established with the gift, the release stated, including an award for a student participating in the clinic “whose advocacy on behalf of children in the juvenile court system inspires hope for a better future” and the Sabrina Ray Justice for Children Summer Fellowship.
Nickole Miller, director of the Joan and Lyle Middleton Center for Children’s Rights, said in the release she is “particularly excited” about the summer fellowship, which will give law students the chance to attend law conferences on child welfare and intern at children’s rights organizations.
“Finances are often a barrier for law students interested in public interest legal work on behalf of children…,” Miller said  in the release. “The fellowship, together with the new Ray of Hope Award recognizing student excellence in the Children’s Rights Clinic, build strong children’s attorneys and envision a future where all children are safe, supported, and empowered.”
Police found Ray’s body, which weighed under 60 pounds and showed evidence of severe malnutrition, in May 2017 in her adoptive parents’ home, Iowa Capital Dispatch previously reported. Two adopted siblings were found with her body, and food was locked inside cabinets and windows were screwed shut.
According to a report from the Iowa Office of Ombudsman, the Iowa Department of Human Services rejected child-abuse reports in the case before Ray’s death and discouraged someone from continuing to share concerns, despite having regularly visited the home and had contact with the family.
“Sabrina Ray deserved a strong legal advocate and (a) safe and loving home,” Miller said in the release. “These funds will be used to honor the life and legacy of Sabrina Ray by supporting and celebrating the next generation of children’s rights attorneys and giving them the tools and experiences needed to be zealous, child-centered advocates.”

“50501 is rooted in nonviolence, collective care, and principled protest. Every action organization under the 50501 name is expected to uphold a strict no-weapons policy, without exception,” the national organization said. “We hold ourselves and all action associated with our banner to these uncompromising standards.” 

Based on information that’s “currently available, it appears” the Salt Lake City chapter “did not meet those standards,” national organizers said.
“The presence of weapons, and any action that endangers lives, stands in direct opposition to the values we uphold,” the national group said. “We feel deep anguish that harm unfolded in a space connected to our name and vision.” 
The Utah 50501 group’s organizers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
According to Salt Lake City police, the shooting happened after two men described as “peacekeepers” confronted another man, 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was openly carrying an AR-15 style rifle. One of the men, reportedly part of the event’s security team, fired three shots from a handgun, grazing Gamboa but also hitting an “innocent bystander,” Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, who was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
Shortly after the shooting, police arrested Gamboa, and he was booked into jail for investigation of murder. Police say, however, that Gamboa did not fire his rifle. The two “peacekeepers,” who wore high-visability vests, were initially detained by police, but were released after being questioned. Police said the man who fired the three shots is cooperating with investigators. 
The Utah 50501 organizers said in a prepared statement issued earlier this week that the “safety volunteer who responded to the individual (holding the rifle) and who was questioned by police is a military veteran.” They also said that their “team of safety volunteers, who have been selected because of their military, first responder, and other relevant de-escalation experience, believed that there was an imminent threat to the protesters and took action.” 
‘Peacekeeper’ involved in shooting at SLC ‘No Kings’ protest is a military veteran, organizers say

In the aftermath of Saturday’s shooting, unanswered questions remain, including more details of who the “peacekeepers” were and how they were vetted to be acting as armed security during the protest. Questions also remain regarding Gamboa’s intentions and why he brought a rifle to the protest. 
As of Friday, Salt Lake County prosecutors had not filed charges against Gamboa or anyone else involved in the shooting. On Thursday, a judge granted the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office more time to determine what charges, if any, should be filed against Gamboa, who remains held in jail with no bail. 
The three-day extension now gives prosecutors until 5 p.m. on Monday to file any charges against Gamboa. On Thursday, District Attorney Sim Gill said the extension was sought because his office had not yet received a formal screening of evidence associated with the charge of murder for which Gamboa was booked. 
“Detectives continue to interview witnesses and involved parties, as well as review voluminous amounts of surveillance and amateur footage of the incident,” Gill said. “This extension will allow the police to present their evidence at a formal screening scheduled for this Friday and allow the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office sufficient time to review, analyze, and make an informed decision to any allegations of criminal wrongdoing.”
Gill added that he asks “for everyone’s patience.” 
“When a person loses their life we are all impacted as a community,” he said. “It is critical that we are thorough, accurate, and faithful to the truth. Arthur Afa Ah Loo’s family and our community of citizens deserve no less.”

Utah is a “constitutional carry” state, meaning its laws allow the open and concealed carrying of firearms without a permit for those who are legally allowed to possess them. In 2021, with HB60, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature eliminated the state’s concealed carry permit requirements. Now, anyone 21 and over who can legally possess a gun is free to carry it loaded and hidden in public. 
Unlike 26 other states, Utah has not adopted a law prohibiting carrying long guns at state capitols or political protests, according to Everytown Research & Policy, an organization that produces research on gun violence and advocates for gun violence prevention. The group has ranked Utah as No. 36 in the country for “gun law strength.” 
National 50501 organizers acknowledged in their Facebook post that “while we do permit firearms at 50501 protests, we recognize that Utah law permits the open carry of weapons, and this reality shaped some of the events that unfolded.” 
They also acknowledged, however, that “this is an active legal investigation,” and they committed to “amend any misstatements as facts emerge.” 
Both the national and Utah chapters of 50501 have expressed devastation for Ah Loo’s death. 
“No words can fully capture the depth of sorrow we feel for Afa’s family, friends, and the entire Salt Lake community,” national organizers said in their post Thursday. “We grieve alongside them.”

,DC,2025-06-20 19:24:27+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Both parties prep for mega-bill marathon in U.S. Senate vote-a-rama,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/both-parties-prep-mega-bill-marathon-us-senate-vote-rama,,"WASHINGTON — The next hurdle for Republican leaders in the U.S. Senate and the “big, beautiful bill”: Democrats — and possibly a few of their own members — in a marathon voting session will make last-ditch attempts to change the tax and spending cut measure.The vote-a-rama, as it’s known, is expected to begin sometime during the last full week of June as Congress heads toward the Fourth of July recess. It will likely begin in the afternoon and  last overnight into the next morning. Senators will debate and vote on dozens of amendments attempting to revise the massive legislation that could have an effect on nearly every American.Democrats, who have 47 votes in the Senate compared to 53 for Republicans, plan to zero in on Medicaid, taxes, corruption, policies that could raise energy costs and proposals that would increase the deficit, according to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and the committee chairs tasked with drafting pieces of the package have spent weeks combing through the House-passed bill to figure out what needs to be altered to avoid divisive floor votes. They’ve rewritten numerous policy proposals to comply with the strict rules that go along with the complex reconciliation process and are now trying to work out disagreements among GOP senators that could doom or complicate a final deal.The goal is to avoid a protracted debate over core GOP provisions in full public view once the vote-a-rama begins, though some senators are already predicting votes on GOP amendments.‘A potentially messy process’Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who has raised concerns about the bill’s impact on rural hospitals, said he hopes GOP leaders reach a consensus before vote-a-rama but didn’t rule out offering his own amendments if they don’t settle their disputes.""Amending it on the floor, that's a potentially messy process,"" Hawley said. ""I would hope that we could get to a good place before that. But we have to fix the rural hospital issue.""Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville said he will likely propose amendments during floor debate, though he declined to say what specific policies he’d seek to change or eliminate from the package.“Yeah, we’ll have some,” Tuberville said. “And we've got them all, we just haven't turned them in yet.”Thune said he and other negotiators are making “headway” toward consensus on the more significant provisions in the package, which in many respects is far from its final form.“The meetings right now are on the major provisions in tax and health. We have sort of pre-litigated a lot of that,” Thune said. “But there are a lot of the other provisions in the bill, chapters in the bill that are still subject to going through the Byrd bath, and we're in the process of doing that. But hopefully that'll be done by early next week.”

Republicans are using the reconciliation process to pass their sweeping tax and spending cuts package through the Senate with just a simple majority vote, requiring them to comply with the Byrd rules.That includes the Byrd bath — going before the Senate parliamentarian to explain how each provision has an impact on federal revenue or spending that is not “merely incidental.” Democrats then usually debate before the parliamentarian the various changes that don’t meet that threshold. The process is named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat.Once the parliamentarian rules what elements comply and which need to be removed, the bill can go to the floor and senators can trudge through vote-a-rama. Eventually, all 100 lawmakers will vote to approve or disapprove of the legislation.GOP senators passing their version of the package would send it back to the House, which passed its version on a slim 215-214 vote earlier this year — and could make yet more changes in the Senate bill.Democrats develop strategyDemocrats are hoping to highlight policy divisions among Republicans during the vote-a-rama. And even if they don’t succeed in getting any of their amendments adopted, several votes could serve as fodder for campaign ads during next year’s midterm elections.Schumer said Wednesday during a press conference it would be “difficult” for Democrats to peel off at least four GOP senators from the rest of the party in order to get an amendment adopted, but said he’s hopeful Republicans will “vote with us on some things they've all said they've agreed with.”Democratic senators, he said, have created a task force to reach out to Republicans on major issues in the package, including how it would impact rural hospitals.“Many of these hospital administrators and employees are Republican,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said. “In many of the rural hospitals, they are the largest employer in the county, and in most they're the only supplier of health care. It infuriates the rural counties, and they tend to be Republican.”‘It’s just a show, it’s a charade’West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said she’s not concerned about having to vote on dozens of amendments. “We're here to vote,” Capito said. “As a creature of the House, we voted all the time on everything, so this doesn't bother me. And, you know, just let the body work its will. If some changes are made, those will have to be dealt with. But I'm not worried about that.""Arkansas Republican Sen. John Boozman said he expects the vote-a-rama will be “a very late night” and that he’s not planning to offer any of his own amendments.As chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Boozman expects to spend a considerable amount of time during vote-a-rama arguing against amendments seeking to change those provisions — including controversial cuts in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food aid for lower-income families.Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson said he plans to spend much of the vote-a-rama “going back and forth from my hideaway,” the ceremonial office that every senator holds in the Capitol building.But Johnson cast doubt on actually being able to amend the package during that process, saying changes to the various bills that Senate committees have released need to be agreed to before then.""You've got to get this before it ever goes to the floor. I mean, you're not going to change things substantially or significantly with amendments. I know people have some idealized version that happens. It doesn't,” Johnson said. “You've got to get these things in the base bill. Amendments; it's just a show, it's a charade.”Vote-a-rama after vote-a-ramaThe Senate has held two vote-a-ramas so far this year, and both demonstrated how difficult it is to change a piece of legislation.The first all-nighter in February went along with Senate debate on its budget resolution and included votes on 25 amendments, with lawmakers adopting just two — one from Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan and one from Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee.The second vote-a-rama took place in April just before the Senate voted to approve the budget resolution that ultimately cleared the way for Congress to use the budget reconciliation process to advance the “big, beautiful bill.” Senators debated 28 amendments, voting to adopt one change from Sullivan.Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, ranking member on the Finance Committee, said he and staff on the panel will continue to parse through details of the panel’s bill, which Republicans just released Monday.Wyden said he plans to hold several town hall meetings in GOP areas of his state over the weekend to gauge how residents there view the policy revisions Republican senators have put forward.""We've had this bill for basically 36 hours. The first time I had it, I stayed up all night, so last night I got a little sleep,” Wyden said on Wednesday. “But on the plane, I'll be working through it. And I expect to be working through it all through the next few days, except when I'm having these town hall meetings where I'll have a number of questions.""",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-06-20 16:07:18.441030

Discovered on Sunday morning, the fire was caused by lighting and has grown through the week. The fire’s acreage was listed at 351 acres as of the most recent estimate, the evening on June 18, and it was 0% contained.
On Wednesday, the Lewis and Clark County Sheriff’s Office issued an evacuation warning for Rimini Road and all feeder roads south of Bear Gulch Road.
The announcement said residents impacted by the warning should gather important belongings and make arrangements for livestock should an evacuation order be issued.
Additionally, the U.S. Forest Service issued a closure order for some parts of Helena National Forest, including a section of the Continental Divide Trail.
The Continental Divide Trail is closed from MacDonald Pass to the edge of the Helena National Forest, near the Luttrell Peak and Old Baldy Mountain area.
The Forest Service also closed a number of its roads in the area, including Minnehaha, Hahn Creek, Flume Creek Road, Telegraph Creek Road, and Bullion Parks.
Land owners or lessees in the area as well as area residents are exempt from the order. Violations of the order are punishable by a $5,000 fine and possible imprisonment.
The fire itself is burning through heavy fallen timber, steep terrain and limited access to the incident. The Jericho Mountain Fire has seen a heavy response from firefighters, with 250 personnel assigned to the blaze.
Eight hand crews are on the scene, as are several helicopters and a variety of other heavy machinery, including skidders, skidgines, and feller bunchers. Scooper planes are also being used to fight the fire.
In a Friday update, Northern Rockies Incident Management Team 9 said they were looking for opportunities to work on the fire’s edge. Fire lines are being constructed and improved west of Minnehaha Road, along the Continental Divide and north of Jericho Mountain.
Thursday’s storms, which brought rain, lessened fire behavior, a press update from the Northern Rockies team said.
Structure protection efforts are being undertaken in Rimini, a small community in the area. The area is historically significant and is home to some early Montana mining claims, as well as a ghost town.

(Credit: Utah Fire Info)An active and fast-moving fire in southern Utah has grown to about 1,000 acres since it was discovered on Thursday, forcing evacuations. 
Residents of the Pine Valley community, home to about 370 people according to Census data, were under a mandatory evacuation order Thursday night after the ​​Forsythe Fire was spotted burning about a quarter mile from town. 
Pine Valley is located about 30 miles north of St. George, in between state Route 18 and Interstate 15. 
As of Friday morning, the fire had burned about 1,000 acres and was not contained, according to Utah Fire Info. Crews worked through Thursday night and no structures were reported lost.

Smoke was visible from St. George, authorities in Washington County said, and crews are using aircraft to fight the fire. Smokejumpers — highly specialized firefighters that parachute into the fire area — have also been called in.   
The ​​Forsythe Fire is one of nine fires that started in the last 24 hours, as the state experiences record-breaking heat and high winds. Other than the ​​Forsythe Fire, the other new fires are all still relatively small. 
So far this year, the Beehive State has seen a reported 328 wildfires that have burned about 13,850 acres. Of those, 243 were determined to be human-caused. At least 47 were natural, and 38 remain undetermined, according to Utah Fire Info. 
The largest fire of the year is the France Canyon Fire, burning in a sparsely populated area outside of Bryce Canyon National Park. The U.S. Forest Service is currently fighting the blaze, which has burned about 7,650 acres and is just 5% contained. 
The Bridge Creek Fire, located on the Navajo Nation near the Utah-Arizona border, has burned about 1,145 acres and is 0% contained.

The city is still trying to get the plaza open before the event, but it may not be complete in time (submitted photo).The clock is ticking. In less than a year, hundreds of thousands of tourists are expected to descend on Kansas City for the FIFA World Cup.
Local leaders tout it as a once-in-a-generation event, which FIFA estimates will bring $650 million to the region. It is touted as the largest sports event ever, with matches stretching over a month.
With the spotlight on Kansas City, as well as the other 15 host cities, nerves are high.
“Anybody who’s not feeling nervous about it is foolish,” said Kansas City Councilman Wes Rogers, who represents the 2nd District in the Northland. “It’s the biggest sporting event in the history of mankind, and it’s a great opportunity for our city. But it’s incredibly high stakes. We’ve got to get it right.”
Cities across the area are gearing up for six matches to be hosted at Arrowhead Stadium, making plans for transportation, public safety, lodging and a variety of other elements.
Here are five key issues that Kansas City leaders are keeping in mind leading up to the World Cup.
 Where will visitors stay for the Kansas City World Cup?

When Kansas City submitted its bid for the World Cup, it had to demonstrate to FIFA that there were 55,000 hotel rooms available within a two-and-a-half-hour radius of the city.
Many tourists will end up at hotels in the metro area. But travelers will likely stay in other cities as far away as Wichita, Columbia, Springfield, Des Moines and even St. Louis.
That will require a more robust network of transportation so that tourists — many without cars — can get to and from the city.
Some cities in the area are also trying to make space by temporarily loosening restrictions on short-term rentals. That would allow more property owners to rent out their homes during the World Cup. Parkville has already voted to loosen its short-term rental regulations starting in May, and Rogers said Kansas City intends to do something similar soon.
Despite a massive influx of tourists, Pam Kramer, president of the KC2026 organizing committee, is encouraging as many community members as possible to stick around — not just for their own benefit but to help tourists appreciate Kansas City.
“From my own travels, my strongest and fondest memories are the people that I’ve met and encountered and the authentic experience of a culture or a place,” she said. “There is something really different about the hospitality and the authenticity of people here … I’m excited for the world to see that.”
 Transportation to the Kansas City World Cup

At a bare minimum, FIFA is expecting that ticketholders will be able to get to and from matches, hotels and the airport. That is a FIFA requirement, and it’s an undertaking on its own.
KC2026 is leasing temporary buses for the duration of the World Cup that will shuttle people between the airport and downtown, as well as between downtown and the stadium.
Rogers said it makes sense for those buses to be temporary, because far fewer people would use those routes during a normal summer.
But Kramer is more excited about how KC2026 is aiming to build a regional transit network during the World Cup to make sure visitors can spread the economic benefits around the metro area to cities like Olathe, North Kansas City, Lee’s Summit and Kansas City, Kansas.
One of KC2026’s goals is to get more people to use public transportation in Kansas City to show them what the public transit network could become with more investment. That, Kramer believes, would be a meaningful legacy for the Kansas City World Cup.
 Public safety

The estimated 650,000 visitors during the World Cup are more than the entire population of the city of Kansas City. That, City Manager Mario Vasquez said, brings some public safety concern.
It’s not so much that he expects visitors to be behaving poorly, he said. It’s just that they may be unpredictable.
During big events like Super Bowl parades, law enforcement may travel in from out of state to provide help — including from Illinois, Kansas, Arkansas or Nebraska. The World Cup is different in that it will be multiple days, rather than a one-time event.
That raises the issue of housing for additional officers who would be staying for several days at a time.
Rogers said the City Council may explore options in the near future.
As far as specific safety concerns, Rogers doesn’t expect gun violence to be an issue at the major fan gatherings around downtown, like the rally at Union Station, because they will have security checkpoints. That, he said, should alleviate some concerns from Kansas Citians who witnessed the mass shooting at the Union Station Super Bowl rally in 2024.
One of Vasquez’s public safety concerns is possible human trafficking or sexual exploitation while tourists are in Kansas City. The Beacon previously reported on sexual exploitation during sporting events in 2023, when the NFL Draft came to town.
 Business and economic development

World Cup visitors will be bringing their wallets, and Kansas City is eager to use the extra business to its advantage.
The Missouri General Assembly voted this year to allow businesses to serve liquor at nearly all hours of the day during the World Cup, and the bill is awaiting Gov. Mike Kehoe’s signature.
Rogers said it will be all the more important to have a temporary modular jail up in time for the World Cup if the city will be keeping bars open until the early hours of the morning.
The Kansas City Council has also pursued legislation to help small-business owners fill vacant storefronts during the World Cup. The hope is that a few successful weekends during the event will help those business owners afford a full-time space.
Rogers said that one way to look at the World Cup is that it will bring 650,000 visitors over five weeks, which will bring economic activity during that time.
But, he said, “what we really need to do is make sure that (those) five weeks are the beginning of the next chapter for Kansas City.”
That means sustainable changes that last much longer than just those few weeks.
Rogers said there’s a place for both kinds of development, and they can work hand-in-hand.
For example, the City Council is also going to be giving grants to small businesses to provide outdoor dining. That’s a short-term solution for the World Cup. But if that’s paired with policy changes, like reducing the fees for outdoor dining, it can become a solution that can be sustainable long after the World Cup is over.
“We don’t just want to, you know, duct tape everything together so we can hold it for a few weeks,” he said. “We want this to be a long-term thing.”
As far as bigger construction projects, Kansas City plans to have its new Berkley Riverfront streetcar extension open before the World Cup, and the city has broken ground on a new parking garage in the 18th and Vine district.
The city is also renovating Barney Allis Plaza to hopefully make it a gathering place for fans. But because of some issues on site, Barney Allis Plaza may not be complete in time for the World Cup, Vasquez said.
Getting things done in time can be a challenge.
Vasquez said that if any property owners want to get a project done before the World Cup, like a new outdoor bar at a restaurant, they need to get their permit applications as soon as possible. It’s likely too late to start new major construction.
 International tourism under the Trump administration

Some Kansas City leaders are concerned that the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown could hinder the city’s ability to attract international tourists.
Since his inauguration, tourists have been detained at the border during their travel in the United States. That includes a British tourist who was detained in Tacoma, Washington, as well as an American woman’s German fiancé, who was deported after two weeks at a detention center.
Several countries have issued travel advisories, particularly for transgender travelers whose gender markers could get flagged upon entry to the United States.
“I know we’ll have visitors probably from close to 100 countries. We want them to come. We want them to celebrate. We want them to watch the game,” Vice President J.D. Vance said. “But when the time is up, they’ll have to go home. Otherwise, they’ll have to talk to (Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem.”
Rogers is concerned.
“We’ve got this great economic opportunity,” he said, “and frankly, a great cultural opportunity to remind people that America, despite some of the rhetoric, is still the most open and welcoming and diverse country in the world. And yeah, I’m really worried that we’re going to present a different face than that and then scare people away because of it.”
A representative from FIFA declined to respond to those concerns but said that nearly 1.5 million tickets have been sold so far for this year’s Club World Cup, speaking to global enthusiasm for U.S.-hosted matches.

His family members regularly give their plasma – the liquid component of blood used in a variety of medical applications – for extra cash, but he said he never will. 
“That’s not too much my style,” he said just before 10 a.m. Tuesday, wiping the sweat from his face with a gray washcloth. “I just like to go to work and go back home.” 
The 37-year-old man said he’s happy with his job at a car wash, which he’s held for most of his adult life after dropping out of school in the ninth grade. He wished not to give his name, but described the freedom offered through his occupation as “music to me.”
“I can just work the way I want to work,” he said. 
Many of the others who visited the Jackson ImmunoTek Plasma Donation Center on a recent weekday morning haven’t struck the same when it comes to earning a living in this part of the city. 
The plasma donation center, located at the intersection of McDowell and Raymond roads on the cusp of west and south Jackson, is one of the few signs of life in an otherwise neglected zone. Family members and friends pick up and drop off their loved ones; people walk to the center from nearby neighborhoods. 
It’s almost as busy as the Cash Savers, a discount grocery store catty-cornered from the biotech center, where people often take the pre-paid debit cards they receive in exchange for their blood to buy groceries. The intersection also includes a gas station, a Rally’s fast food restaurant, an empty store that locals say used to sell car parts and an AutoZone. 
“They put it in the right spot of town,” said the man waiting for his brother outside the center. The hours are 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.
He was describing the plasma center’s convenient location on two main thoroughfares, but he’s right for another reason: This area of Jackson has a high concentration of poverty, few economic opportunities and is rapidly depopulating. 
The dire economic situation is top of mind for the city’s new leadership, as incoming Mayor John Horhn has pledged to reverse these trends, telling attendees at the South Jackson Parade and Festival earlier this year that it would be the first thing on his to-do list. 
Similar promises came with the center’s opening in 2022 inside a former pharmacy that closed during the Great Recession. That year, ImmunoTek boasted that it could bring an estimated economic boost of $5 million a year for a “part of Jackson that is undergoing revitalization,” according to the Mississippi Free Press. 
The company did not respond to inquiries from Mississippi Today, so the center’s exact economic impact in the years since is unknown. For now, ImmunoTek remains one of the newest establishments operating in this part of Jackson and was likely drawn by the same data points that make other investors look elsewhere. 
“It’s amazing how the blood of a group of people was used as a commodity at the beginning of this country and how the blood of this same group of people is still being a commodity today by them having to sell it in order to survive,” said Fredrick Womack, founder of Operation Good, a violence prevention organization. 
Womack said when his group has encountered people walking to ImmunoTek from the surrounding neighborhoods, he’s attempted to intercept them and help them find stable, long term employment.
Studies have shown that plasma donation centers are more likely to be located in areas with higher rates of poverty. In Jackson, the ImmunoTek center is located in a census tract where the median household income was $29,500 in 2020, according to data compiled by the city of Jackson. And CSL Plasma, another plasma donation company, has facilities in south and northwest Jackson. 
“Regardless of how you feel about the community, businesses – for lack of a better word – match with the outputs of the demographic,” said Jhai Keeton, the director of Jackson’s planning and development department. 
Keeton has been working to bring more development to west and south Jackson, but he said recruiting businesses to the area has proven difficult due in part to the concentration of poverty, by which he means lower median household incomes, less spending power and declining property values. 
“What I would love for the greater community to understand is that economics is all about data,” he said. “Every individual needs to look at themselves as a dataset, and when you have 100 individuals in one neighborhood, they need to look at themselves as a collective dataset.” 
When it opened, the center offered a larger payout for a plasma donation than it does now, said Darian Little, a cook at Buffalo Wild Wings who had donated blood Tuesday to get money for groceries. He said he used to get $100 per session, but that now the center offers him $40 for the first and $70 for the second. 
Nonetheless, the facility remained consistently busy throughout the morning. In the 45 or so minutes it takes, and even with the lower going rate, a donor can still earn 10 times the state’s minimum wage of $7.25-an-hour. 
Several people had stopped in to ImmunoTek on their way to work. One woman wore a blue Waffle House shirt. Another left the facility wearing nursing scrubs and a blue bandage on her arm. 
Others came because it was their only source of income. As the morning wore on, the center’s parking lot started to fill up with people.
Anderson Wallace was sitting on the curb, waiting for his pulse to fall below 100 so he could make a donation. He has visited ImmunoTek four times a month since he arrived in Jackson from Brooklyn, New York, earlier this year to visit his mom. 
If Wallace had been able to find employment, he wouldn’t be here, he said. But he’s applied everywhere – Amazon, UPS, and various jobs through Indeed.com – with no luck. 
“It’s too tough down here,” he said. “I gotta go back to New York.” 
Two sisters whose electricity had gone out this morning after they were late paying the bill had also tried to donate, but their iron was too low, so the center turned them away. One of them shrugged when asked what they were going to do instead. 
Deonte Woodson’s iron was also too low, so while his partner was inside giving a donation, he sat on the hood of his car and soothed their baby. The 30-year-old said he has a couple of businesses, though he didn’t give specifics, and his partner aspires to be a TV reporter. But for now, they need to donate plasma to make ends meet.
“She ain’t doing nothing now, just being a housewife,” he said. “For right now, I try to handle all the bills and take care of the kids.” 
Ella Moore, a former Dillard’s employee, was waiting in her father’s car to pick up her 32-year-old son who was inside. Moore said her son is in between construction jobs. A few years ago, the young man tried to gain steady employment by starting his own mobile car wash, but he got into an accident, Moore said, leaving him without a car.
Moore grew up in Jackson and has raised her kids here, but she can’t make sense of the city. She said she used to shop at a corner store by her house, but a few months ago, a man came in holding a rifle, and the shopkeeper did nothing. She doesn’t shop there anymore.
“I think people just don’t care no more, because ain’t nobody really listening to them,” she said. “It’s like they ask you a question and they say they’re gonna do this, they’re gonna do that, but in reality, they really don’t do it. You’re voicing your opinions on things, and there’s nothing happening.” 
When was the last time she felt Jackson’s leaders were listening? Moore pursed her lips. 
“Probably in the early 90s,” she said, citing an example of a skating rink on Terry Road that closed, then reopened after community uproar.
But a few years later, Moore went by the rink, and it was closed again. Now she feels like there’s nothing for her grandkids to do in south Jackson, she said, except for a small park up Raymond Road from the plasma donation center. 
She voted for Horhn, because she wanted to see change in Jackson, but she is skeptical that any will come. When she heard on the news that part of the Metrocenter Mall had a new owner, it just made her think about the last time people promised to redevelop the shopping center. 
“We shall see, we shall see, we shall see,” she said. “Cause that would’ve been a nice thing to have a skating rink right there, a water park for the kids. Another era.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/17163427/ImmunoTek-1.jpg,,,2025-06-20 16:07:18.441030

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Vanderbilt University Medical Center, one of the largest academic research and hospital care systems in the southeast, expects to lay off 650 employees as a result of grant and other funding cuts made by the Trump Administration, it said in a statement.  
The teaching and trauma care hospital system will reduce operating costs by $300 million overall, the statement said.  The medical center said the cuts are being made “in response to the impact of budgetary actions in Washington, DC related to government-sponsored research and patient care.”
The staffing cuts affect employees primarily in research, administrative and other support areas, the statement said. 
“While this is extremely difficult, the staffing loss represents less than 2% of VUMC’s total workforce,” the statement said. “To support affected employees, VUMC is providing severance packages and other assistance.
“VUMC sees more than 3.5 million patient visits each year and remains committed to meeting the needs of all who depend on us for health care.”
The statement noted that Vanderbilt University Medical Center will continue to hire clinical staff for a long-planned, 180-bed Jim Ayers Tower.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-20 18:41:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Will Lamont veto CT HB 5002? Governor promises to ‘get it right’,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/20/ct-hb-5002-housing-lamont-sign-veto/,Gov. Ned Lamont is confronting a quandary largely of his own making: Whether to sign the largest housing bill to ever reach his desk.,"Gov. Ned Lamont returned from the Paris Air Show this week to confront a quandary largely of his own making: Would he sign an omnibus housing bill his administration negotiated? Or would he bow to unexpectedly virulent opposition from suburbs crucial to a potential reelection campaign?
Opposition to House Bill 5002, the most consequential housing bill to reach his desk in his seven years in office, exploded immediately after Lamont shared his present inclination to seek a third term in 2026, inextricably linking the fate of the bill to his own ambitions.
Lamont reiterated Friday he would like to see revisions when the General Assembly returns for an unrelated special session, expected before much of the housing law would take effect. But his immediate choice is whether to sign the bill with suggestions for change or to veto it and call for a do-over. 
His deadline to act on the bill is Tuesday.
In comments Friday before and after an appearance in New Haven celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana by Wooster Square, Lamont declined to share his leanings or detail what more he needs to know before making the call.
“I’m just talking to a lot of people right now. The housing bill, to be really effective, towns have got to buy in. I want them to take the lead. Most of the towns have taken the lead. Some of them haven’t,” Lamont said. “Housing is absolutely crucial to the economic growth and opportunity in the state, so we’re going to get it right.”
HB 5002 is an expansive 41-section bill that attempts the address a critical housing shortage by requiring municipalities to set goals for affordable housing, prioritizing state aid to communities that build housing, and streamlining approval for so-called “middle housing,” defined as a building with two to nine units.
Under the bill, zoning regulations would have to allow middle housing in commercial zones as “of right,” which means approval without any discretionary zoning action other than a review to determine if a site plan conforms with applicable regulations and will not impact public health and safety.
Another provision would prohibit municipalities from rejecting a housing development solely due to a failure to conform to formulaic on-site parking regulations, rather than a specific impact on public safety.
CT169Strong, an advocacy group opposed to any intrusion into local planning and zoning prerogatives, put out an email blast an hour after the governor concluded a press conference on June 5, the day after the annual legislative session ended. Lamont had signaled an interest in reelection — and doubts about HB 5002.
They described the bill as heavy handed.
“Collaboration brings forth good workable policy, not unfunded mandates and extreme positions. We thank Gov. Lamont for being thoughtful in this process and we are happy to meet with him,” the group said. They provided the email addresses of Lamont and his chief of staff, Matt Brokman. He was the governor’s chief negotiator on the bill.
The group said prioritizing aid for communities producing housing would be punitive and described the so-called “fair share” goals as “quotas.”
A deluge of emails followed.
Lamont said he found the fair share goals to be “aggressive,” but calling them quotas “was fake news.” He was hoping to bring down the temperature before making a decision, but that seems unlikely.
“They’re screaming on both sides,” Lamont said Friday as he exited his black SUV  at Pepe family’s storied pizzeria in a three-story brick building, a survivor of urban renewal and highway construction. “There’s not much middle ground. The story of American politics right now.”
Mayor Justin Elicker, a supporter of HB 5002 who had complained recently that Lamont’s fiscal conservatism was harming municipalities, was waiting to introduce him. Elicker’s only agenda Friday was pizza, not politics or policy.
“The governor and I don’t always agree on everything, but we agree on pretty much everything,” Elicker told the gathering. “And you can be darn sure that today we agree that New Haven has the best pizza in the country.”
Two days earlier, Elicker issued a statement praising HB 5002. “I’m hopeful the state legislature and the governor will be able to find common ground and a pathway to get this important legislation across the finish line and open doors to new housing in Connecticut.” 
On Friday, a coalition of eight pro-housing groups, including the Open Communities Alliance and United Way of Connecticut, shared a letter urging Lamont to sign a bill that they see as meeting specifications largely set by his administration.
“Signing this bill would be a major step forward on solving one of the state’s most pressing issues. It has been crafted specifically with many of your previously stated concerns in mind,” they wrote.
Pete Harrison, an advocate who was not a signatory to the letter, said he believes the governor is likely to sign the bill.
“I think the governor wants to get to a yes. He has certainly been involved in this process during the legislative session, even before the vote,” said Harrison, the Connecticut director of the tristate Regional Plan Association. “I think his instincts have been very good on recognizing how important the bill is.”
Republicans, who hold fewer than one-third of the seats in the General Assembly and have not won a gubernatorial contest in nearly two decades, have tried with little success to transforms concerns over home-rule, zoning and housing into a source of votes.
In 2022, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, Bob Stefanowski, promised Fairfield voters he would repeal and replace 8-30g, a 30-year-old law that gives developers leverage in communities where less than 10% of the housing stock is affordable. Lamont cruised to reelection, flipping 45 suburbs that Stefanowski had won in their first, much closer match in 2018.
Alexis Harrison of Fairfield, a founder of CT169Strong, failed to recapture the 132nd House District seat in 2024, using concerns about bills like 5002 as a platform. Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, who had flipped what had been a GOP seat in 2020, beat Harrison, 58% to 42%.
But there are signs of nervousness in some of the Fairfield County districts now represented by Democrats, as was evidenced by the 87-64 House vote for the passage of the housing bill. 
Every Republican voted in opposition, joined by 18 of the 102 members of the House Democratic majority. Two thirds of the Democratic dissenters were from Fairfield County, among them Leeper.
“There is no harder issue, probably, in Fairfield County, than tackling housing,” Leeper said. “It is the No. 1 driver for the cost of living.”
Like Lamont, she said she had concerns about whether the fair share goals were realistic. Rep. Sarah Keitt, also a Democrat of Fairfield, also voted no. But Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, the third Democrat representing the Bridgeport suburb, voted for the measure.
Four years ago, she successfully worked for passage as co-chair of the Planning and Development Committee for a fair-housing bill that, among other things, eased the approval process for accessory dwelling units in single-family zones.
“I experienced a lot of the same kinds of conversations that we’re experiencing now, and some of the things that we talked about then in that bill that were so controversial, including accessory dwelling units, are things that people are now talking about as real positives,” she said. “And I see this opportunity the same way, because this issue is the No. 1 crisis facing our state.”
Joe DeLong, the executive director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, said many of his members were not opposed to the bill in totality but had reservations about certain provisions.
“We just think there’s a few provisions in this bill that weren’t completely thought out that could be modified in a way to make it more workable, and perhaps even get people more energy behind it, from the cities and towns, as opposed to animosity,” he said.
DeLong dismissed complaints that prioritizing state aid for communities building housing was punitive, but he is aware of concerns that language limiting the ability to require adequate parking for new housing was overly broad.
“There are towns where you’ll you’ll suffocate the businesses on town greens if all of the residents are taking up all of the parking spaces in that in those areas, and there’s nowhere for shoppers or anyone to come in and park,” DeLong said. “I don’t think those things were really thought about.”
 DeLong said it appears the governor is experiencing buyer’s remorse for giving his “blessing to the legislation before he realized exactly what was in it or how it was written.” But he praised Lamont for trying, if belatedly, to rally support for the substance of the bill, with revisions.
“He hasn’t really drawn a line in the sand with anybody on it. I think he’s trying to bring people together,” DeLong said. “I’ve been pretty hard on the governor over a lot of things lately, but wherever this thing ends up landing, I’m at least appreciative of his effort. You know that he’s trying to bring people together on it.”
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, the legislature’s most prominent advocate of the bill, said that after meetings with the governor and his staff, he was uncertain of the governor’s intent.
“We’re conversing with the governor’s office,” he said. “We expect to come to an agreement certainly before Tuesday, and hopefully that will give him the comfort and the understanding that will allow him to sign the bill and knowing in the future that we’re going to come back to this and make some adjustments that are needed.”
Peter Harrison of the Regional Planning Association said a veto would be a mistake.
“I think a veto would be, I think, pretty bad politics, pretty bad policy. And it would signal Connecticut is still in the same rut,” he said. “And that’s going to signal a lot of bad things to businesses, home builders, young people, people that we want to come and do business in Connecticut.”
The governor said he shares the goals of the advocates.
“I know that we’re never going to get this state growing again with economic opportunity for everybody, never going to bring down the price of housing unless you get more housing,” Lamont said. “That’s workforce housing, affordable housing, supportive housing, lot of housing right here in New Haven, our downtown areas.
“I just got to figure out whether this bill is the right way to get it done.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7895-1024x805.jpeg,,,2025-06-20 15:03:28.370464

A Utah County adult has been diagnosed with measles, state health officials said on Friday. The person was unvaccinated and didn’t report any out-of-state exposure, meaning that the infection was transmitted within Utah, they warned.
The Utah Department of Health and Human Services said it hasn’t identified any other cases in the state as of Friday morning. However, they’re encouraging Utahns who may have been in the same area as the infected person to monitor themselves for symptoms.

Before the diagnosis and during the illness’ infectious period, the Utah County resident visited several public places and medical centers in Orem, including Parkway Health Center on June 13, and the Timpanogos Regional ER, which the patient visited on June 14 from 2:14 p.m. to 7:02 p.m., the department said in a news release. 
“People who were at these sites at the same time or two hours after this person could have been exposed to measles,” the release says. “We encourage unvaccinated people who were in these locations during the exposure time period to monitor themselves for symptoms.”
The Utah diagnosis comes amid a national spike in measles cases reported in at least 36 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Thursday, there were 1,214 confirmed cases across the country and 23 outbreaks reported in 2025.
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

Measles symptoms typically show up 7 to 14 days after exposure. Symptoms like fever higher than 102.2°F, cough, runny nose or red eyes may indicate early stages of measles. A rash could appear after four days of fever, the Department of Health and Human Services said. 
More than 90% of Utahns are reported to have the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and “are highly protected against infection,” according to the department. However, infants younger than age 1 aren’t eligible for the immunization and are especially vulnerable to measles.
“The MMR vaccine has been used since the early 1970s. It has saved millions of lives and prevented significant suffering around the world.” Leisha Nolen, Utah Department of Health and Human Services state epidemiologist said in a prepared statement. “The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. Decades of careful research has shown the benefits of being vaccinated against measles far outweigh any risks the vaccine may pose. We encourage those who are not vaccinated to talk to their doctor about receiving the vaccine.”

May 22, 2025 | ScreenshotA corrective action plan, a new “go live” approval process and additional project management support are among steps being taken by the Michigan Department of State as it seeks to correct issues with its new campaign finance reporting system, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told reporters on Friday.
Benson, in a virtual press call, detailed solutions the department was crafting after a disastrous launch of the $9 million Michigan Information Transparency Network project, or MiTN, which replaced its aging but heavily-used and mostly user-friendly campaign finance reporting system.
She also said department staff were working around the clock, until 11:30 p.m. on some nights and on weekends, to get the system back on track and improve it along the way.
“We’ve had hard conversations with our team about how this happened, the issues, the snafus, how we would move forward,” Benson said. “I am personally ensuring that we can do this consistently with our team over the months ahead. We are making improvements, not just to the system, but also internally to our own testing, training and launch processes, so that we can use this experience to continue to, on all of [the] other work that we’re doing to modernize systems within our department, increase those efficiencies ever more.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The rollout of the new system caused delays in reporting, and the overall functionality of the website was bothersome for many users, including news reporters, political watchdogs and nonprofit groups who rely on access to campaign finance information to better track how politicians spend campaign money and who gives it to them.
Meanwhile, scrutiny mounted last month from Republican lawmakers in charge of the state House of Representatives, who have separately requested hordes of information on election manuals and other materials through the House Oversight Committee. That includes a lawsuit filed by House Republicans against Benson over a subpoena related to the request, and an effort to impeach Benson over the spat and other grievances.
Christina Anderson, Benson’s chief of staff, testified on May 20 before a joint meeting of the House Oversight Committee and the House Subcommittee on General Government, where she apologized for the system issues and vowed improvements.
Benson on Friday gave an overview of what was being done from May through June.
The secretary of state said the department has increased the frequency of communication with users over bugs and issues and increased training. The department has conducted additional user research to better understand and prioritize improvements, and devoted additional project management and testing support from the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget.
As Anderson alluded to in May, Benson said Friday that it also has a corrective action plan in place with Tyler Technologies, the contracted vendor on the project. Benson said Tyler was processing refunds for any downtime the department has experienced on the website and has made clear that the department would suspend payments until the system is working as expected.
A new process to approve when aspects of the system go online was also established to ensure thorough vetting before new aspects launch.
On the technical side, Benson said four main improvements were made via two new software updates between May 31 and June 17.
Additional data fields were implemented to align candidate and lawmaker forms as outlined in statute, and the public search function was also improved. Users can now search by contributor information, view migrated committee notifications, and fixes were made to lobby search functions to include searching by office title.
An improved filer experience was implemented, Benson said, fixing known issues with committee module import information and data display fields within the program. 
Other improvements dealt with personal finance disclosure data both for filers and the data itself.
On the personal finance disclosure system, the department has a July 13 deadline to launch and improve that system, less than two weeks before the July 25 filing deadline. To date, the department has received information from 159 filers, with 47 submissions through the new network and 112 via email submissions or PDF files.
Benson said the department has added additional training videos to the system for filers, additional after-hours phone support, increased email communication and resolved a handful of issues directly with filers.
System improvements for the July personal finance system release include a campaign finance filing summary report, which was missing when the state transitioned to the new system, usability improvements for filers and additional improvements to the public search module.
As updates continue, the department is also conducting a usability study with eMichigan, the state’s online government services platform, to drive long-term user experience improvements, which is a work in progress.
Benson also plans to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday, June 24, which she announced in a letter sent Tuesday to state Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay), the committee’s chair.
The letter, written by Anderson, notes that Benson was “pleased” to accept the committee’s request for testimony on MiTN improvements, but noted the expectation was that questions would focus only on improvements to the new system and not other matters considering the ongoing litigation between House Republicans and Benson.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-22-at-4.37.05 PM-1024x666.png,,,2025-06-20 15:03:28.370464

Kobach urged the revenue department to transfer revenue from the sales tax exclusively to the county, and as of this month the state agency will comply with the recommendation. In 2024, Morton County voters overwhelmingly approved a 10-year, 1% sales tax targeting revenue to the county hospital and ambulance services. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Attorney General Kris Kobach objected to the Kansas Department of Revenue’s decision to divide proceeds from Morton County’s 1% sales tax among the county and municipalities after voters a decade ago passed a flawed resolution that didn’t specifically tie the revenue to health care.
In 2024, the Morton County Commission learned the Department of Revenue had since 2015 — nine years — spread revenue from the countywide 1% sales tax to three cities as well as the county.
Kobach said in a nonbinding legal opinion last month that the revenue department should stop carving off sales tax revenue for distribution to cities because the clear voter intent 10 years ago was to earmark sales tax revenue for benefit of the county hospital.
On Friday, an official with the Department of Revenue said that starting this month Morton County’s 1% sales tax and compensating use tax would be remitted solely to the county government.
The problem from the Department of Revenue’s perspective was the original sales tax resolution put forward in 2015 by the county commission referenced a general tax provision rather than a special tax provision tied to funding of health care services. The revenue department concluded the resolution embraced by county voters required the 1% sales tax revenue to be shared with cities and the county.
However, Kobach said the ballot debate was framed in a way voters understood a “yes” vote for the sales tax equated to support for collecting sales tax for county health care operations.
“The question here is whether the electors of Morton County understood what their vote meant on the ballot proposal. We believe they did,” Kobach’s written opinion said.
In the opinion, Kobach said state law didn’t require the commission’s published notice or ballot proposition to include a reference to the state law giving a county authority to create a retail sales tax. The result of the commission’s citing of the wrong state law in that 2015 resolution shouldn’t have resulted in diversion to cities of money that voters thought would go to county health services, Kobach said.
“After the voters approved the measure, but before adopting the tax, the board passed and published an amended resolution correcting the authorizing provision,” the opinion said.
The conflict came to the forefront as county officials worked to gain voter consent for a new 10-year, 1% sales tax supporting the cash-strapped county hospital and emergency medical services. In May 2024, that countywide sales tax for health care passed 547-215.
Presentations prior to the latest vote indicated the objective was to invest three-fourths of revenue at Norton County Hospital and one-fourth in Norton County Emergency Medical Services.
Kevin Faughnder, chief operating officer of Norton County Hospital, campaigned for the sales tax by pointing to rising operating costs and declining insurance reimbursement revenue at the hospital.
He said Norton County Hospital was among 88 rural critical access hospitals in Kansas operating at a loss.
“The challenges Norton is facing are not unique to Norton County Hospital,” he said. “They’re just what the reality of health care is.”
If the sales tax were to fail at the ballot box, Faughnder said, the county hospital could be compelled to reduce important medical services or eventually close.
County EMS director Craig Sowards told voters the sales tax was designed to avoid escalation of the county’s property tax.
“Our hope is the sales tax will offset the need for any type of mill levy. Nobody wants property taxes to go up,” Sowards said.
The legal opinion from the attorney general was sought by David Thompson, an Elkhart attorney representing the Morton County Commission.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6170189-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-20 15:03:28.370464

President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
 Trump’s hopes for next year

The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Stockton wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” he wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
 For housing providers, uncertainty is growing

For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Dias Goncalves was arrested by federal immigration authorities shortly thereafter. (Screenshot from Mesa County Sheriff’s Officer YouTube)A Mesa County sheriff’s deputy who shared information that led federal immigration officers to arrest a Utah college student in Grand Junction has been placed on leave pending an internal investigation.
The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said earlier this week that federal authorities had “extrapolated” information about Caroline Dias Goncalves’ immigration status from information sent by Investigator Alexander Zwinck via the encrypted messaging app Signal to a group organized by federal law enforcement for drug interdiction efforts.
Zwinck pulled over Dias Goncalves on Interstate 70 near Fruita on June 5 for driving too close to a tractor-trailer, and although she was let go with a warning she was detained a short time later by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Body camera footage released by the department shows Zwinck asking Dias Goncalvez, who was born in Brazil and brought to the U.S. by her parents as a 7-year-old, whether she was “born and raised” in Utah, after noting she had “a little bit of an accent.”

Colorado law generally prohibits cooperation and information-sharing between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration authorities. ICE representatives have ignored questions about the incident from Newsline and other media outlets.
The sheriff’s office declined this week to answer follow-up questions about the content of the Signal message and its intended purpose, but it said in an updated statement Thursday that it was “reviewing communications” sent by its officers to the group chat as it investigates whether the message complied with state law and departmental policies.
“This includes, but is not limited to, working to understand if and when Mesa County Sheriff’s Office employees were made aware that the information shared for drug interdiction efforts was being utilized for immigration enforcement,” the statement said.
Whether Zwinck faces disciplinary action “will be determined by the outcome of the full administrative investigation,” it added.
The arrest of Dias Goncalves, a nursing student at the University of Utah with no criminal record, sparked an outcry from national groups that advocate on behalf of “Dreamers,” young adults who lack permanent legal status after being brought to the U.S. as children.
“Caroline — and Ximena Arias Cristóbal and numerous other Dreamers recently detained and even deported — should have never been targeted in the first place,” Gaby Pacheco, president of the advocacy group TheDream.US, said in a press release. “America’s national interests are better served by delivering education and legal status for Dreamers instead of raids, detentions, and deportations.”
Tensions over immigration enforcement have risen across the country in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has ordered ICE to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people held in ICE detention with no criminal record has risen sharply since January.
Dias Goncalves is expected to be released from the ICE detention facility in Aurora in the coming days after an immigration judge in Denver granted her bond on Wednesday. Her attorney, Jon Hyman, said that she and her family were requesting privacy after the “traumatic past few weeks.”
“We know that Caroline’s arrest and detention should not have happened in the first place,” Hyman said in a statement. “Investigations should continue to ensure that other young immigrants in Colorado do not have to go through the same harrowing experiences.”

(Courtesy photo)As Katrice Grant went through high school, college and graduate school, she participated in federally funded student support programs called TRIO, which introduced her to the idea of going to college in the first place.
The TRIO programs — described as ones “designed to identify and provide services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds”— set Grant on the path for campus visits and academic scholarships that paid for part of her tuition while she studied psychology and Africana studies. TRIO advisors connected her to her community on campus and future opportunities; boosted her the confidence and organization to delve into research; and paid for her travel to a conference in Maryland where she received her first graduate school offer at Johns Hopkins University.

That education allowed Grant to work as a K-12 school counselor for about 12 years in Virginia, Dubai, Albuquerque and Bernalillo.
Now a student success specialist at the Student Support Services-TRIO program at the University of New Mexico’s main campus in Albuquerque, Grant says the Trump administration’s plan to zero out funding for TRIO —funded at nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2024— would harm students and their families.
While TRIO programs don’t have race- or ethnicity-based criteria for admission, Grant said, the reality of the U.S. leads to disadvantages for people of color, and so the program includes many students of color.
“We’re all being threatened with elimination,” Grant said. “If we think about the Trump administration’s attack on diversity, equity and inclusion, any kind of programs that support those missions are being targeted even more.”
Statewide, 42 TRIO programs at 16 different institutions serve more than 10,000 students, according to TRIO New Mexico. Those programs are supported by more than $13 million in federal funding.
In interviews last week, people who work for TRIO programs in New Mexico told Source NM they provide students with holistic services, including academic advising, tutoring, financial literacy and emotional support. Without these programs, they say, thousands of students and their families would lose their futures, and New Mexico’s economy would suffer.
“I think it’s going to hurt New Mexico and states all over the nation, economically,” said Bernadine Booky, director of student support services at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces and a past president of TRIO New Mexico.

Rick Martinez, an academic advisor in the TRIO Student Support Service program at San Juan College in Farmington and president of TRIO New Mexico, told Source NM that cutting the programs would dramatically drop the rate of students at two-year universities graduating or transferring to four-year programs, and ultimately send the country backwards when it comes to education.
“It’s really sentencing them to a life of low-skilled labor type jobs, or a much longer process of upward socioeconomic migration,” Martinez said. “When we don’t have people in higher-paying jobs, they’re also not paying higher taxes, so this has widespread implications on the entire nation.”
Martinez said students do not succeed when they are only given money for tuition and books. They also need career counseling and life skills training that their parents weren’t able to give them, he said.
For example, first-year students in the TRIO program at UNM are expected to meet monthly with an advisor and a peer coach twice per month to help them get acclimated in the classroom, connected to student organizations and informed about the best places to eat off campus, Grant said.
Peer coaches offer tutoring, workshops in soft skills like good study habits, career readiness, financial literacy and social and cultural activities, Grant said. The Education Opportunity Center at UNM also helps adult students get back into academics, she said.
TRIO workers say these needs are even more pronounced in more rural parts of New Mexico, especially in areas adjacent to Native nations.
“Many of our students are from the reservation, so coming to San Juan College is their first time off the reservation,” Martinez said. “We really give students cultural experiences where they haven’t had that opportunity otherwise.”

Most of the students at San Juan College come from Navajo Nation but others also come from Apache and Ute nations, he said.
The administration’s budget recommendations also said colleges and universities should pay for these kinds of support programs instead of “engaging in woke ideology with federal taxpayer subsidies.”
Booky said this stance shows how uninformed the administration is about what TRIO does, its effects and its history.
With roots in U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson administration’s “war on poverty” legislation in the 1960s, the federal education programs called TRIO are meant to support first-generation college students, low-income students and students with disabilities.
U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon on June 3 said the goal of her proposed cuts at her agency is to “make education better, fairer and more accountable by ending federal overreach and empowering families, schools and states who best know the needs of their students.”
McMahon said her priority is to “reform and strengthen those programs, fix what’s wrong, increase accountability and not abolish them.”
TRIO program officials told Source NM that there are already strong accountability measures in place, with annual audits.
“There are very detailed measures of trying to stay accountable,” Grant said. “If the program isn’t meeting the grant objectives, then it wouldn’t be funded.”
TRIO programs are held to a high standard, Booky said, and their grant funding can already be cut if they don’t perform to the objectives they’re required to meet.
Russel Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, in his May 2 budget recommendations for the upcoming fiscal year, referred to TRIO and Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) as “a relic of the past,” and access to college is no longer the obstacle it once was.
Booky said her jaw dropped when she read the administration’s plans.
“They have done nothing but create obstacles now, with their proposals,” she said.
James P. Holloway, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs at the University of New Mexico, told Source NM that both TRIO and GEAR UP are “tremendously valuable programs that serve the people of New Mexico.”
“These programs help thousands of young and adult learners annually to complete high school, to be ready for college and to get the most from their undergraduate experience,” Holloway said in a statement. “Their loss would certainly create new barriers to educational attainment for the people of our state.”
Grant said while she acknowledges that progress has been made in the U.S., she said there is still a long way to go.
“All the oppression that has been experienced, and continues to be experienced, is still impacting our students,” she said. “These programs are needed, and they will never be a relic of the past until our country looks a lot different than what it looks like today.”

That essential complexity is the main cause of the intraparty squabble between House and Senate budget writers and first-term Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who is now threatening to veto the two-year spending plan that is supposed to be in place at the start of the fiscal year on July 1.
Ayotte’s revenue projections have always been more optimistic than both the House and Senate, and so while the veto threat may be a little surprising, the current Republican divide was not only predictable but inevitable. And the path that led us here stretches back much further than the beginning of the legislative session or even the November election. Through overly aggressive business tax cuts, the repeal of the interest and dividends tax, and the expansion of a rudderless school voucher program, among other purposeful state missteps and various federal clawbacks, Republicans have abandoned huge swaths of the people they are supposed to serve, now and tomorrow, for the single-minded pursuit of ideological purity.
This, right now, is the bed they made.
Throughout New Hampshire’s budget process, I’ve been thinking a lot about Ron Swanson. He’s the white, heterosexual, libertarian everyman who was played brilliantly by Nick Offerman on “Parks and Recreation.” If you were to screen a montage of Swanson’s philosophies in action for New Hampshire Republicans, you would hear nothing but admiration. He can and will fix anything, builds his own furniture, kills his own food, defends personal privacy with as much vigor as he attacks bureaucracy, and holds a deep mistrust of traditional monetary systems. Nothing is wasted in the world he inhabits — not words, actions, or emotions. He is the celebrated ideal of the rugged individualist.
But in all of that admiration it’s easy to miss the subtlety of Swanson’s beautiful undoing: as much as he despises the idea of government institutions, that is how much he cares about real people. He struggles because the rigid political identity he embraces is, in the end, incompatible with the realities of our interconnectedness — of people, yes, but that extends to the environment, its resources, and even the imperfect systems we have designed in our endless striving for universal prosperity.
That’s the hardest pill for Republicans to swallow, it seems: Try as you might, you cannot separate the institutions you dismantle from the people they were created to serve.
In this whole budget mess, Ayotte appears most upset about the way House and Senate decisions harm politically important constituencies, namely police and firefighters, whose pensions are affected, and the city of Manchester, which stands to lose millions for education. She also knows that the back-of-the-budget cuts to the state’s largest department, Health and Human Services, hold unforeseeable consequences — and peril — for her administration and the people of the state. 
She is right to be upset about those cuts. But, again, this isn’t the hand that Republicans were dealt. This is the hand they chose, and the cards were face up. They picked the tone and the targets, and the priorities and policies flowed from there.
Imagine if Republicans attacked corruption within the health insurance industry — which builds wealth through unscrupulous claim denials — with the same passion that they have attacked immigrants. 
Imagine if they went after corporate polluters — who receive a fat taxpayer subsidy every time they skip town without cleaning up their mess — the way they have gone after trans teens who dare to play on a school soccer team.
Imagine if, instead of writing voucher checks to wealthy families who already send their kids to private schools, they tried to fix a funding system that directly penalizes people who live in our poorest communities.
Just imagine, and then maybe spend a little time thinking critically about the mess New Hampshire finds itself in.
The right question to ask when starting work on a budget “for all of New Hampshire” is, “What do we owe to each other?” But the question Republicans have built their entire identity on is, “Among those with little, who is getting more than they deserve?”

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Honoring slain Minnesota leader, Maine House speaker makes plea not to normalize political violence

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Regardless, LGBTQ+ rights organizations and their legislative allies say they are determined not to let GOP attempts to repeal Michigan’s protections succeed.
The nation’s highest court on Wednesday issued a 6-3 decision ruling that a law Tennessee’s state legislature passed in 2023 banning gender affirming care for minors would be upheld.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision did not itself ban gender-affirming care for young patients, rather it upheld a state law, which is an important distinction, Michigan state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) said on “X” following the decision, as Michigan has no such law.
“An important thing to remember in light of SCOTUS’ ruling on gender affirming care for minors: it does not ban this care. It allows states to enact laws to ban it. Michigan does not have such a law, and gender affirming care should still be available,” Pohutsky posted.
Her colleague, state Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing), Michigan’s first openly nonbinary lawmaker, issued a statement reiterating that point and making clear the fight would continue for trans rights. 
“To every trans young person and family watching this ruling with fear and heartbreak: I see you. I grieve with you. And I’m standing with you. You are not alone. Trans youth are loved, and we are fighting for you, today, tomorrow, and every day this fight continues,” Dievendorf stated.

During the two years that Democrats held a once-in-decades majority in Michigan’s Legislature from 2023 to 2024, Pohutsky, Dievendorf, and other lawmakers, put numerous pro-LGBTQ+ policies into law including embedding LGBTQ+ rights into the state’s civil rights laws, making it easier for transgender Michiganders to change their names and banning the “gay panic” legal defense.
Additionally, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel fought against Tennessee’s ban being upheld, signing onto an amicus brief against bans in Tennessee and Kentucky in 2023 which argued the laws were discriminatory.
However, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), who is also a candidate for governor, applauded the Supreme Court’s decision Wednesday on “X’, calling for Michigan to do the same.
“Let’s make Michigan a sanctuary for our children and common sense,” Nesbitt said on X.
Republican lawmakers in both chambers of Michigan’s Legislature have introduced legislation to ban gender affirming care, which mainly consists of talk therapy and hormone treatments, but also more rarely, gender-affirming surgical intervention for young patients.
It’s unlikely such legislation would pass Michigan’s Democratic-led state Senate or get approval from the state’s Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
When signing into law a ban on conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth in 2023, Whitmer called herself a “lifelong ally” to the community who as the mother of a gay daughter was proud to sign the ban into law.
Advocates vow to ‘never stop fighting’ for trans youth
The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to uphold Tennessee’s ban on gender affirming health care for minors marks a devastating blow for the health and well-being of Tennessee residents and a bad trend of legislative harm towards transgender youth, Equality Michigan said in a statement following the decision.
While Michigan has no ban on health care services for transgender residents, Executive Director of Equality Michigan Erin Knott said the group stands ready to “fight like hell” to preserve the rights of transgender youth in the state.

“This decision is cruel and dangerous. It ignores the overwhelming consensus of the medical community and opens the door for politicians to play games with kids’ lives. In Michigan, we stand firm. Trans youth are loved, protected, and supported here.”
Also speaking out was Stand with Trans, which posted to TikTok that while the ruling was “was a painful setback for trans youth and the families who love them…hope is not lost.” 
The group noted several trans-related court victories, including a federal judge certifying a class-action lawsuit challenging the administration’s passport gender marker ban and a federal court ruling in favor of LGBTQ+ health centers and resource organizations who had faced grant threats.
“Yes, the Supreme Court targeted gender-affirming care. But this ruling does not define our future. We are resilient. We are growing. We are still here. At Stand with Trans, we will never stop fighting for a world where trans youth can live fully, freely, and with pride,” the group posted.
Meanwhile, a Trans and Nonbinary Community Meeting has been scheduled for Monday, June 30 at 6:30 p.m. in Ann Arbor, hosted by The People’s Coalition. It will allow interested community members to ask questions and hear legislative updates from State Sens. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) and Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township) and State Reps. Jimmie Wilson, Jr. (D-Ypsilanti), Jennifer Conlin (D-Ann Arbor Township), Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), Morgan Foreman (Pittsfield Township) and Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor).

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Scientists at Southeastern Louisiana University have found dangerously high levels of toxic metals and other contaminants in Lake Maurepas and have traced most of the pollution to industrial and other human activities.
Led by SLU chemistry professor Fereshteh Emami, a team of researchers analyzed 400 water and sediment samples collected from multiple locations and depths in the lake from June through December 2023 and developed new methodologies to trace the origin of the pollutants, track how they spread and determine the factors that make them worse. The results were “alarming,” according to the study, which was published in Environments in November and accepted for publication in another scientific journal, ACS Omega, this month.
The analysis revealed concentrations of heavy metals and nutrients far beyond the thresholds the Environmental Protection Agency considers safe. Arsenic levels peaked at 420% above the safe limit for lakes and 6,300% over the EPA’s drinking water threshold. Lead and cadmium were detected at similarly high levels averaging orders of magnitude above safe limits. Nickel, copper, and manganese concentrations were also observed above their respective safety thresholds.
Heavy metal exposure is known to cause severe health problems and can be fatal to humans.
“I was just surprised how polluted the area is,” Emami said in an interview.
Emami’s team at Southeastern developed new methodologies that allowed them to trace the pollutants to Pass Manchac and three rivers that feed into Lake Maurepas: the Blind, Amite and Tickfaw. It indicated that industrial and agricultural activities are major sources of the pollution.
The researchers also detected a spike in contaminants near Pass Manchac following the Oct. 23, 2023, “super-fog” multi-vehicle pileup on Interstate 55, indicating that toxic chemicals from combustion vehicles are also running off into the lake.
The heavy metal concentrations found in Lake Maurepas are similar to those later detected following breaks in the waste containment levees at the Atlantic Alumina (Atalco) facility in Gramercy last year. Atalco’s toxic metals — which also included arsenic, cadmium and lead, among others — ended up in a public drainage system that flows into the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas.
Although Emami’s new methodologies did not trace the pollutants to specific facilities, news of the Atalco incident brought to light a previously unknown event that aligns with their findings, at least anecdotally, Emami said. More sampling and analysis is needed deeper upstream into those rivers in order to further narrow down the sources, she said.
The researchers found other contaminants in the lake, including high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and a parameter called chemical oxygen demand, which indicates the presence of organic pollutants in water. According to the study, all three parameters were elevated at averages beyond what is considered safe. Their methodologies traced these pollutants to urban runoff and agriculture.
The samples contained other toxic metals, such as mercury, at levels that were within safe limits. But the study noted they still pose a threat to humans and the environment through bioaccumulation, in which low doses of a heavy metal can amass in a living organism over time and add up to a dangerous level.
“Because of the non-biodegradable and bioaccumulative nature of these heavy metals, they could accumulate and biomagnify in fish and other aquatic animals,” the researchers wrote. “As a result, they could enter the human body eventually through the food chain.”
Emami said mercury is particularly dangerous because it easily bioaccumulates in crops and animals such as fish. Her team is conducting a follow-up study in which they are testing aquatic samples from Lake Maurepas and surrounding rivers for heavy metals and other contaminants such as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as “forever chemicals.”
Corinne Gibb, a chemist who works for the environmental advocacy Louisiana Bucket Brigade and was not involved in the study, said the research very clearly points to pollution that is flowing into Lake Maurepas from other water bodies.
“What they’re showing for sure is that the pollution is coming through those rivers,” Gibb said.

Southeastern has been monitoring Lake Maurepas since the proposal of a carbon sequestration project by Air Products & Chemicals. The company plans to use carbon capture technology to trap emissions from an $8 billion hydrogen manufacturing complex in Ascension Parish and take them by pipeline to Lake Maurepas, where Air Products will have the capacity to inject an estimated 5 million tons of CO2 per year about a mile below the lakebed.
In the first half of 2023, Air Products performed seismic testing to map the geological formations under the lake. In August of that year, the company moved a large temporary drilling rig into Lake Maurepas that served as a test well for the collection of core and fluid data, which ended in early 2024.
Emami’s team initially suspected but were ultimately unable to link any chemical pollutants to Air Products’ activity in the lake. Aside from providing a multi-million dollar funding grant, the company played no role in any aspects of the study, its design or the decision to publish the results.
“We’re committed to protecting the Lake Maurepas environment and ecosystem, which is why we have supported the independent monitoring of the Lake,” Air Products spokeswoman Christina Stephens said Wednesday after learning about the SLU study’s findings. “It’s important for people to understand the lake’s ecosystem, and as our work progresses we will continue to operate in a safe and responsible fashion.”
That still doesn’t assuage concerns of some local lawmakers. Rep. Kim Coates, R-Ponchatoula, who ran for office on a platform of protecting Lake Maurepas, pointed out the study shows the baseline water quality of the lake is already deeply concerning and could be made worse with general disturbances that accompany lakebed drilling and similar industrial activities.
“Adding deep geological carbon sequestration to an ecosystem already under strain from nutrient pollution raises serious questions,” Coates said. “Even well-intentioned projects can have unintended consequences in such a delicate and dynamic environment. Until more is known, extreme caution is not just warranted — it’s essential.”
SLU’s study is the first of its kind to combine dynamic statistical models with water quality data to trace pollutant sources and their driving factors. This allowed Emami’s team to provide a comprehensive assessment of the chemical composition of Lake Maurepas based on a wide array of data. The methodology can also be used to predict when and where pollutants will flow or migrate to other areas, she said.
“Using the models, we were looking for the origins of the pollutant sources, and I wanted to know if the pollution sources in the Blind River could [let us] predict what was gonna show up in Manchac,” Emami said. “And it did.”
Emami said Pass Manchac’s significant tidal exchange between Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain has allowed her team to conclude that the water quality and levels of pollution between the two estuaries are virtually the same.
Until the start of Southeastern’s research, there was no ongoing public monitoring for toxic metals in Lake Maurepas.
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality spokesman Matthew Day said the public should be aware of existing fish consumption advisories, such as one issued last year for Lake Maurepas based on elevated mercury levels detected in fish tissue. However, the agency does not conduct any regular heavy metal monitoring in Lake Maurepas because it is not required under Clean Water Act obligations, Day said.

(Inset photo courtesy Iowa District Court; facility photo via Google Earth)An Iowa nurse who allegedly admitted stealing painkillers from nursing home residents has agreed to surrender her license.
The Iowa Board of Nursing alleges Andrea Raffield, 42, of Reinbeck admitted that on several occasions she removed controlled substances from the supply of a nursing home and misappropriated the drugs for her personal use.
According to the board, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing investigated the matter and determined an allegation of dependent abuse against Raffield was founded based on the preponderance of evidence related to the alleged drug theft.
The available board records give no indication as to where the alleged violations occurred. However, court records show that in November 2023, Raffield was criminally charged with tampering with records, prohibited acts involving a controlled substance, and prohibited acts involving illegal intent to deliver a prescription drug.
Police alleged Raffield had used her position as a licensed practical nurse working at the Westbrook Acres nursing home in Gladbrook to illegally obtain the drugs.
According to police records, Raffield concocted a scheme that involved ordering unneeded Tramadol, an opioid painkiller, for a resident, destroying the records of delivery of the drug, and then stealing the medication for her own use. In addition, police alleged she diverted Tramadol from “multiple residents” of Westbrook Acres for her personal use. At least 54 tablets of Tramadol were stolen, according to police.
As part of a plea agreement, the records-tampering charge was later dismissed and Raffield pleaded guilty to the two prohibited-acts charges and received a deferred judgment. Assuming she successfully completes a sentence of two years’ probation, her conviction will be expunged from court records.
Raffield was also charged with the misdemeanor offense of dependent adult abuse. Pursuant to the plea agreement reached in the drug case, the abuse charge was dismissed.



Other nurses face disciplinary charges
Other Iowa nurses facing sanctions from the board include:
— Katia Shallcross of Fort Madison, who recently surrendered her license. Board records indicate that in 2017, Shallcross, then known as Katia Petlitchka, surrendered her license for the first time after pleading guilty to a criminal charge of running a drug house in Lee County.
In July 2024, Shallcross requested reinstatement of her license to work in Iowa as a practical nurse. In February 2025, the board consented to the request, noting that Shallcross had not had any further criminal convictions since surrendering her license and had completed a mental health evaluation and substance abuse evaluation, both of which were reviewed by the board.
Shallcross’ new license was subject to a probationary period of at least 12 months during which she was required to complete a nursing refresher course, submit to chemical testing and the monitoring of her practice, and refrain from using alcohol or illicit drugs.
Two months later, in April 2025, the board charged Shallcross with behavior that constitutes unethical conduct pr practice that is harmful to the public in that she failed to comply with board orders. According to the board, Shallcross has again surrendered her license, stating that she doesn’t want to submit to monitoring and has decided to “go a different route professionally.”

(Photo by Ted Soqui for CalMatters)Donald Trump can continue to control the National Guard in California for the time being after a panel of judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined he followed the law in deploying troops to Los Angeles.
The order, handed down Thursday evening, is the latest in a fast-moving legal saga playing out over Trump’s decision to call up the National Guard and U.S. Marines to the Los Angeles area in response to protests after federal immigration law enforcement agents began worksite raids and arrests two weeks ago. California’s Democratic leadership, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, has called the deployment unnecessary and illegal.
The appeals court order in a lawsuit filed by Newsom contesting the deployment isn’t surprising; the panel signaled an openness to the Trump administration’s legal arguments during a legal hearing on Tuesday.
In court earlier this week, attorneys from the Trump administration argued the president’s deployment was “unreviewable” by courts.
The appeals court judges disagreed that the decision was beyond the reach of the judicial branch, but found the president had a legitimate interest in protecting federal employees when he called up the troops.
“The undisputed facts demonstrate that before the deployment of the National Guard, protesters ‘pinned down’ several federal officers and threw ‘concrete chunks, bottles of liquid and other objects’ at the officers.”
Two of those judges were appointed by President Trump in his previous term.
Trump deployed the troops through a presidential memo on June 7 and cited a rarely used federal statute permitting a president to deploy the National Guard in times of invasion, domestic rebellion, or the inability for the federal government to carry out its laws. Trump’s order was for 60 days and technically applied to all of the state Nation Guards in the U.S.
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass imposed a weeklong curfew in the city’s downtown after Trump’s deployment. She and other California leaders have maintained that local law enforcement agencies were more than capable of addressing the unrest that followed high-profile immigration sweeps earlier this month.
Trump’s order marked the first time since 1965 that a president deployed the National Guard against the wishes of a state’s governor. A group of former service secretaries and four star military commanders wrote an amicus brief supporting Newsom’s lawsuit challenging the deployment.
“The court rightly rejected Trump’s claim that he can do whatever he wants with the National Guard and not have to explain himself to a court,” Gov. Newsom said in a written statement after the Ninth Circuit released its ruling. “The president is not a king and is not above the law. We will press forward with our challenge to President Trump’s authoritarian use of U.S. military soldiers against citizens.”
What’s next
What happens next could take one of several turns. On Friday a lower court judge, Charles Breyer, will hold a hearing on whether to return the troops to Newsom through a preliminary injunction. Breyer last week issued an order that would have temporarily halted Trump’s deployment, but the Ninth Circuit blocked it.
Now, the battle over whether federal troops can remain in Los Angeles is operating on three parallel tracks — the case the Ninth Circuit decided, which can be appealed; Friday’s hearing on the preliminary injunction; and the full merits of the case that would be argued through a prolonged trial.
For Newsom’s legal team to prevail in Friday’s hearing, they’ll have to clear a higher threshold of scrutiny than they did when they initially won back the National Guard last week, albeit for a few hours. That’s because anyone seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate that the merits of their arguments will likely prevail in the full trial.
The appeals court’s decision could influence Breyer’s thinking, legal thinkers said, even if he initially signalled support for the Newsom administration’s arguments.
“It’s kind of hard to disentangle the two processes when we think about how Judge Breyer will be weighing” the preliminary injunction hearing, because a lot of that’s going to be informed by what these higher level courts decide,” said Christopher Mirasola, an assistant law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.
No matter what Breyer does after Friday, it’ll likely quickly go back to the appeals court. And if the appeals court keeps halting the lower court’s orders, Trump keeps the National Guard for the duration of the lower court’s full trial.
Would the Newsom team try to appeal the injunction with the Supreme Court?
On one hand, “why not shoot your shot when you got the opportunity, right?” asked Mirasola rhetorically. But there’s a chance the high court comes back with such a strong opinion favoring the Trump administration that it could “substantively affect how Judge Breyer treats the merits of the case.”

(Screenshot from Mesa County Sheriff's Officer YouTube)A Mesa County sheriff’s deputy who shared information that led federal immigration officers to arrest a Utah college student in Grand Junction has been placed on leave pending an internal investigation.
The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said earlier this week that federal authorities had “extrapolated” information about Caroline Dias Goncalves’ immigration status from information sent by Investigator Alexander Zwinck via the encrypted messaging app Signal to a group organized by federal law enforcement for drug interdiction efforts.
Zwinck pulled over Dias Goncalves on Interstate 70 near Fruita on June 5 for driving too close to a tractor-trailer, and although she was let go with a warning she was detained a short time later by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Body camera footage released by the department shows Zwinck asking Dias Goncalvez, who was born in Brazil and brought to the U.S. by her parents as a 7-year-old, whether she was “born and raised” in Utah, after noting she had “a little bit of an accent.”

Colorado law generally prohibits cooperation and information-sharing between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration authorities. ICE representatives have ignored questions about the incident from Newsline and other media outlets.
The sheriff’s office declined this week to answer follow-up questions about the content of the Signal message and its intended purpose, but it said in an updated statement Thursday that it was “reviewing communications” sent by its officers to the group chat as it investigates whether the message complied with state law and departmental policies.
“This includes, but is not limited to, working to understand if and when Mesa County Sheriff’s Office employees were made aware that the information shared for drug interdiction efforts was being utilized for immigration enforcement,” the statement said.
Whether Zwinck faces disciplinary action “will be determined by the outcome of the full administrative investigation,” it added.
The arrest of Dias Goncalves, a nursing student at the University of Utah with no criminal record, sparked an outcry from national groups that advocate on behalf of “Dreamers,” young adults who lack permanent legal status after being brought to the U.S. as children.
“Caroline — and Ximena Arias Cristóbal and numerous other Dreamers recently detained and even deported — should have never been targeted in the first place,” Gaby Pacheco, president of the advocacy group TheDream.US, said in a press release. “America’s national interests are better served by delivering education and legal status for Dreamers instead of raids, detentions, and deportations.”
Tensions over immigration enforcement have risen across the country in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has ordered ICE to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people held in ICE detention with no criminal record has risen sharply since January.
Dias Goncalves is expected to be released from the ICE detention facility in Aurora in the coming days after an immigration judge in Denver granted her bond on Wednesday. Her attorney, Jon Hyman, said that she and her family were requesting privacy after the “traumatic past few weeks.”
“We know that Caroline’s arrest and detention should not have happened in the first place,” Hyman said in a statement. “Investigations should continue to ensure that other young immigrants in Colorado do not have to go through the same harrowing experiences.”

MAYHEW, Miss. – A summer camp for girls in northeast Mississippi is designed to help produce the next generation of skilled construction workers.
FORGE’s Girls Construction Camp brought together 12- to 15-year-old girls last week for mentorship, interactive workshops and hands-on experience in the traditionally male-dominated field of construction. 
This is the program’s second year, and  24 campers participated, double last year’s number. The camp took place at East Mississippi Community College’s Golden Triangle campus.
FORGE is a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing awareness of skilled trades among young people.
“We start out young, work with them as they grow, hoping to get more and more interested in construction and the skilled trades,” said Melinda Lowe, FORGE’s executive director.
Demand for workers in construction and other skilled trades is growing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the U.S. will have an average of 663,500 job openings per year in construction and extraction until 2033. This field has a median annual wage of $58,360.
Christee Roberson is owner and founder of West Point-based Graham Roofing. She is also a founding member of FORGE and a trade partner for the camp. She and her team taught the girls about roofing. 
Roberson said it’s important to introduce construction and other trades to young people, especially girls.
“I think, being a female in the industry and never knew that this was something I could do, it’s important for sure to show other females that they can be in the trades, too,” she said. 
Aveline Webb, 12, of Starkville was a first-time camper. 
“We have been building our boxes,” Webb said. “We put up drywall. We’ve done roofing, electrical, plumbing, all the stuff that you would need to build a building.”
In addition to the lessons, the campers heard from guest speakers and worked in groups on a central project – building and decorating food pantry boxes. 
Jada Brown, 15 from Lowndes County, attended the camp last year and came back as student mentor.
“What I hope they take away is knowing how to build and wanting to want to do it in the future, and see themselves doing it,” she said. 
Lowe said the camp provides useful information even for those who don’t enter construction.
“We already have one young lady who has been helping her family replace some shingles that were damaged in a recent storm,” Lowe said. “We’ve had others who have fixed the stoppers in their sink, because they learned here how to fix that.”
The food pantry boxes will be placed in and around Lowndes County in the coming weeks.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/13141132/3X0A4626.jpg,,,2025-06-20 13:09:09.565948

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis announced during an unusually early Friday morning news conference that a second flight carrying Floridians evacuating Israel had landed at Tampa International Airport.
Florida began the rescues this week after Israel and Iran fell into conflict, exchanging missiles and killing hundreds.
Following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel, Florida did the same in terms of the airlift.
“Given what’s happening over there, given that you have a barrage of missiles being launched by a very hostile regime into Israel, given that the airport’s totally shutdown, given that the neighboring areas aren’t exactly easy to navigate, this was probably the most challenging and logistically difficult mission that the Florida Department (sic) of Emergency Management has done — certainly in my time, and I don’t think there’s been anything like it,” DeSantis said during the 5:30 a.m. press conference at the airport.
According to DeSantis, Florida has helped “effectuate” more than 1,500 people’s exit from Israel.
Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Division of Emergency Management, said the Friday morning flight from Cyprus had about 160 people on board, bringing the total to 300 flown out and more than 1,100 evacuated by ferry.
The operation is also facilitated by Grey Bull Rescues, a Tampa foundation focused on rescuing Americans from conflict zones, and the Florida Department of Transportation.
“Florida stands with its residents. In peace and in crisis, we will always rise to the challenge. This is not just a rescue mission, it is a reflection of Florida’s values of safety, courage, and resilience,” Guthrie said.
Guthrie said his staff has been working around the clock on rescues and that more people will be rescued.
Also overseas facilitating rescues is state Sen. Jay Collins, a retired Army Green Beret whom the governor described as “almost like an action figure.”
‘Florida-focused’
DeSantis said it is a “Florida-focused mission” but other Americans won’t be turned away. Many of the people rescued were students and people participating in the Israel birthright program, he said.
“I think people should be proud that you have a state that when they see a problem, when they see a challenging mission, that we don’t shy away from it and pass the buck, we step up and we lead and we get the job done,” DeSantis said.
Josh Hammer, an editor for Newsweek, joined DeSantis and Guthrie after returning from Israel.
Hammer said he was in Israel for a wedding, flying there a week and a half ago.
Hammer said he decided to leave Israel to protect his six-month-old daughter from missiles and reached out to Collins after the senator posted on social media that he was participating in rescues.
“The whole week has just been a total blur. I feel like I’m not even here physically. Thank God that the Jewish sabbath starts tonight, because we really desperately need that rest and that sleep,” Hammer said alongside the governor at the early morning news conference.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Hoot–owl restrictions are in effect on the upper Madison River above Hebgen Lake, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
Hoot–owl restrictions prohibit fishing from 2 p.m. to midnight each day. These restrictions started Thursday and will stay in effect until conditions improve.
For other restrictions, FWP directed people here.
FWP’s drought policy provides for angling restrictions when flows drop below critical levels for fish, when water quality is diminished or when maximum daily water temperatures reach at least 73 degrees for three consecutive days, FWP said. Water temperatures of 77 degrees or more can be lethal to trout.
These restrictions are designed to protect fish that become more susceptible to disease and mortality when conditions like this exist, FWP said. One short-term strategy to address heat-induced stress in Montana’s wild trout is to reduce catch-and-release mortality by alerting anglers to fish only in the morning.
Anglers can reduce stress on fish at all times of the year by getting fish to the net or in hand quickly, keeping them in the water and reviving them prior to releasing them back into the river.
If high temperatures and extremely low flows persist, anglers may want to consider fishing areas with less stressful temperatures and conditions, such as larger lakes or reservoirs, or higher elevation waterbodies.
Along with monitoring stream temperatures, FWP also monitors stream flows and in some streams holds instream flow water rights. FWP’s water program can issue a call on junior water users, when appropriate, to contribute to stream flows through the late summer and early fall.

My path to this point hasn’t been easy. 
I lost my mom in March 2020, during my sophomore year of high school, and my dad when I was just 8 years old. Living with that kind of loss while trying to move forward in life and school has been an ongoing challenge. 
There’s a common narrative that college is supposed to be the “best years of your life” (for academic and personal growth), but for students like myself and the many others who are grieving: It can feel like you’re expected to “wear a mask” and just “keep swimming.”


Family and peers often put intense pressure on us to succeed, pursue higher education, and be “okay.” But the path of grief doesn’t always allow that consistency. If I didn’t carry the constant desire to make my parents proud, I don’t know if I’d be where I am today. That motivation has been my anchor to succeed. 
In an essay published on October 7, 2024, writer Justin Grimes put it well: “Dealing with loss while juggling school or work isn’t easy, and there’s no manual for handling it perfectly… Grief doesn’t follow a timeline, and you shouldn’t expect yourself to either.” 
Justin captures the truth that many of us know all too well: grief doesn’t end after a semester or a school year. It lingers, often returning in waves when we least expect it. 
According to a student article from Purdue University, “40% of college students are grieving a death…Servaty-Seib’s research with grieving college students has indicated that students dealing with grief often struggle academically.” Students are silently navigating the emotional toll of grief. This statistic underscores that grief is not a rare or isolated experience; it’s a widespread issue affecting nearly half of the student population. 
You never truly know what someone else is going through. There is immense pressure on students to be able to fit in socially, excel in their academic responsibilities, and present as emotionally stable, regardless of the personal challenges they may be enduring. We need more unspoken compassion in our classrooms and communities. Empathy to all. 
Whatever path someone takes, whether it’s finishing school on time, taking a break, or finding a nontraditional route, should be accepted without judgment. Remember, grief is not a weakness, and it’s a normal part of the cycle of life. 
As always, with time, patience, and support, will come the final stage of grief: acceptance. It doesn’t mean forgetting or moving on. It means learning to live with the loss. It means learning that love can only grow stronger with distance. It means understanding that grief and love can coexist and that healing doesn’t erase the past, but honors it. It means learning to carry the memories without being crushed by them, to smile at what was, and to hope for what still can be. 
In the acceptance stage, one finds inner power, peace, and the freedom to move forward in light and love.

The IEDA approved the benefits through its High Quality Jobs program, noting that nearly 60 jobs at the sausage making plant will have salaries above $30 per hour.
The plant will employ 250 people the first several years and eventually scale up to 500 jobs, according to the release.
Gov. Kim Reynolds commented on the tax benefit announcement and said the JBS facility was “tremendous news” for Perry and the whole of Iowa.

“This investment by JBS reflects confidence in Iowa’s workforce, our strong agricultural economy, and our commitment to growing vibrant communities,” Reynolds said. “At a time when Perry has faced real challenges, this investment brings renewed hope and opportunity for the hardworking families who call this community home.” 
A 1,300-employee Tyson facility shuttered in Perry last summer, leaving a large employment hole in the community. 
JBS Foods is building an entirely new facility on the southeast side of town, once the zoning is approved by the city. The facility will have 150,000 square feet of space and represent a $135 million investment. 
According to JBS, which announced plans for the facility in late May, the plant will process around 500,000 sows each year, which would equate to 130 million pounds of sausage.
The Brazilian company’s USA CEO Wesley Batista Filho said the company was “grateful” to the state of Iowa for its “continued support.” 
“This investment aligns with our ongoing commitment to Iowa, our producer partners, team members and the U.S. market as we look to build a best-in-class sausage production facility,” Batista Filho said in a statement. 
The plant is slated to be fully operational in late 2026, and while not officially approved by the city, Perry Mayor Dirk Cavanaugh has been publicly supportive of the project. 
“We look forward to being part of the Perry community — creating quality jobs and economic opportunity in the region,” Batista Filho said.

(Photo courtesy of the S.C. Department of Motor Vehicles)COLUMBIA — Starting this fall, the Department of Motor Vehicles will no longer issue day-of driver’s licenses in a shift to make state IDs more secure, the agency announced Friday.
Residents with current licenses don’t need to get theirs updated until the expiration date on it. The new licenses, beginner’s permits and identification cards will be made of stronger material and use laser engraving that makes them more difficult to counterfeit, according to a Friday news release.
“First and foremost, these updates will better protect South Carolinians from becoming victims of identity fraud,” agency director Kevin Shwedo said in a news release. “Additionally, they will provide a more secure and reliable credential for law enforcement, merchants, retailers, and other parties who count on the authenticity of the licenses and identification cards we issue.”
Leaders of SC courts, DMV warn what could happen if ‘ancient’ technology isn’t upgraded

The cards will also look different, using a to-be-announced new design that more prominently features Palmetto State imagery, according to the agency.
The changes involve centralizing the production of driver’s licenses, permits and ID cards.
Unlike the current system, in which a person visiting the DMV can leave with a license or ID before walking out the door, the state DMV will start mailing the cards out. In the meantime, people will receive a temporary certificate that serves the same purposes as the card for which they applied, according to the DMV.
Because receiving a new card could take up to two weeks to arrive in the mail, the DMV encourages people not to wait for the expiration date on their license to renew it. Their local branch will be able to return the older license or ID with a hole punched in it so people can continue using it until their new one arrives in the mail, according to a news release.

Reeves signs most spending bills into law,Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/20/belated-budget-gov-reeves-signs-most-spending-bills-into-law/,"Governor approves most special session bills, enacting $7.1 billion Mississippi budget.","Gov. Tate Reeves on Thursday signed the vast majority of the state’s budget bills into law but vetoed a handful of the measures, which finalizes the state’s $7.1 billion budget for the next fiscal year, which starts July 1. 
The governor wrote on social media that the budget is fiscally conservative and “essentially halts the growth of government.”
“In short, the $7.135 billion budget will help us get the job done on your behalf, and it will help us break new ground all across our state,” Reeves said. 
The budget for the next fiscal year is typically completed in the spring, but the Legislature adjourned its 2025 session earlier this year without agreeing on a budget due to Republican political infighting. The governor called lawmakers into a special session in May to pass a budget. 
The measures the governor vetoed were portions of the Department of Finance and Administration’s budget, parts of the Mississippi Development Authority’s budget, a portion of the State Health Department’s budget and a bill that attempted to give the Attorney General’s Office $2.5 million to combat human trafficking. 
The only bill the governor completely vetoed was a House bill that sought to allocate $2.5 million in excess revenues for the Attorney General’s Office to help victims of human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation  
The state constitution gives the governor the power to set the parameters for what legislators can consider during a special session, not legislators. Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and several senators argued that the legislation was outside of the governor’s special session parameters, but they passed it anyway. 
“All state action, including legislative power, must be exercised within the strict boundaries established by the Constitution,” Reeves wrote in his veto message. “Failure to recognize such limitations on power threatened to undermine the legitimacy of the rule of law — the very foundation of our Constitutional Republic.” 
The Mississippi Constitution also gives the governor the power to issue partial vetoes, or line-item vetoes, of appropriation bills, which the governor did for three other measures. 
One of those measures was a provision in the Mississippi State Department of Health’s budget that directed the state agency to send around $1.9 million to the Methodist Rehabilitation Center. 
After House members passed the bill, legislative staffers realized that the money could be a violation of federal law and regulations, placing Mississippi’s multi-billion-dollar Medicaid funding at risk. 
When the bill arrived in the Senate for consideration, senators were faced with the option of forcing the House back to the Capitol or sending a flawed bill to the governor for him to veto. They chose the latter. 
In the Department of Finance and Administration’s budget, the governor vetoed money for a project at the Mississippi Children’s Museum and LeFleur’s Bluff State Park. In the Mississippi Development Authority’s budget, Reeves vetoed $6.9 million for the Mississippi Main Street Revitalization Grant Program.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/29192608/State-of-the-State-2.jpg,,,2025-06-20 12:12:15.200829

In the wake of the assassination, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety (Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.
But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

You can read more about the section here.

In Tunica County, Mississippi, wind energy is working.
Delta Wind, the state’s first utility-scale wind farm, has brought over $350 million in investment to the area and electricity to power 80,000 homes each year.
Wind projects are often among the largest taxpayers in the communities where they’re built. Delta Wind is expected to deliver substantial benefits for Tunica County, with tens of millions in projected tax revenue over the life of the project, typically 20 to 30 years, per industry standards.
This creates long-term, stable funding to support local public schools, road repairs, emergency services and other critical public needs. Landowners who host turbines also receive annual lease payments, generating new income while continuing to farm their land. This is what it looks like when a community embraces opportunity.

Across several rural Mississippi counties, energy developers have signaled interest in making substantial investments in renewable energy. In some communities, local officials are actively considering updates to zoning ordinances that could determine whether — and how — those projects move forward.
Policies aligned with industry best practices could support continued farm operations while unlocking major economic opportunities for these areas.
Mississippi isn’t standing still at the state level. Gov. Tate Reeves recently signed SB 3166, a law that incentivizes investment in renewable energy. It may be a technical policy, but the signal is clear: the state is ready to welcome new investment, especially in agricultural communities.
Recently, the governor also launched Mississippi’s “Power Play” initiative—a broader effort to reduce regulatory barriers, encourage private investment and position the state as a leader in energy policy and innovation.
Now it’s time for Mississippi counties to turn that momentum into action, while wind investments are still on the table.
Investments in wind energy strengthen our communities in so many ways — powering statewide economic development, providing new local tax revenue, offering steady income to landowners and farmers, all while maintaining existing agricultural operations right up to the base of the turbines.
Not long ago, opportunities like these were only available to our neighbors to the west — states like Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, where wind now powers a significant share of the electricity supply and early investments in wind helped fund schools, strengthen infrastructure and diversify rural economies.
In a recent episode of WBUR’s On Point podcast, Samuel Davis, a sixth-generation rancher in Texas, said:  “Not every county, not every community, is blessed with oil and gas. People say, ‘Why don’t they just drill for oil?’ Well, they don’t have it, so you have to be resourceful. Every county, every school district has to use what they have.”
Thanks to advances in turbine technology, these same kinds of opportunities are now available to Mississippians. But realizing them will depend on local governments stepping forward to catch the wind while they still can.
This is a chance to bring millions in new tax revenue, land payments and jobs to more counties across the state. Tunica County showed what’s possible. It embraced the opportunity and helped launch a project that’s delivering homegrown power and investing in the future of its schools, families and local services.
The wind is blowing. The only question is: Who will catch it?

Senate Majority Floor Leader Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, asked Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond for an official opinion, which could be legally binding.
House Bill 1217 prohibits individuals from performing sexually explicit or obscene acts in public places or areas where minors are present. It also bans political subdivisions from authorizing the performances on public property.
The measure became law last month.
“The Legislature has made it abundantly clear that sexually explicit performances have no place in public spaces, especially in front of children,” Daniels said. “Unfortunately, drag shows continue to spark controversy in Bartlesville and across the state, underscoring the need for further legal guidance.”
Daniels asked Drummond if drag performances were obscene or if certain actions were necessary.
She also asked if a performance by a person dressed in drag is protected speech under the First Amendment.

House of Representatives chamber with a football play in the foreground. (Illustration by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CREATIVE/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s governing body for high school sports altered its bylaws this week to ensure it can keep functioning amid legislators’ efforts to ban “name, image and likeness” deals for pre-college student athletes.
The approved new wording in the South Carolina High School League’s bylaws says students “may not earn compensation” for their sport.
The bylaws previously said students “may earn compensation” as long as it’s not tied to their athletic performance and does not involve school or league logos, to include an incentive to enroll at a certain school.
It wasn’t meant to be a policy for or against NIL, and the slight shift in wording doesn’t change that, said league Commissioner Jerome Singleton.
Rather, the phrase is part of the rule that students must maintain amateur status, meaning they can’t be paid for playing a sport. The previous wording reflects the league’s inability to control anything beyond sports, he said.
It still can’t. But the league wanted to make clear it was not condoning NIL deals after the Legislature inserted a clause in the state budget banning public school districts from joining any athletic association that permitted, allowed or authorized such compensation.
State Sen. Sean Bennett, who authored the budget clause, said it was absolutely directed at the High School League, an independent, dues-paying organization that sets and oversees the competition rules for participating middle and high schools.
“I hope everybody involved with high school athletics realizes they are extracurricular activities, and they are no place for the ugliness or business activities ruining college athletics,” Bennett, R-Summerville, told the SC Daily Gazette.
The league’s executive committee unanimously approved the wording Tuesday, two weeks from the ban taking effect with the July 1 start of the fiscal year. The overwhelming majority of the league’s more than 400 members are public schools that potentially faced not being able to participate in league-organized athletics in the coming school year.
Singleton said the altered wording changes nothing in terms of the rule’s intent.
If a student uses school or league logos or clothing as part of an endorsement deal, or receives money for their participation, they are still violating the league’s amateur policy, he said.
Punishment on a first offense is a warning. The second time it’s a one-year suspension from High School League competition. Each additional violation would result in at least another one-year suspension, with the exact period of ineligibility “based on the nature of the violations.”
“From the very beginning … the league does not support NIL for athletic purposes. That’s the only authority we have the right to reject,” Singleton said. “You can change the wording, but you can’t change the intent.”
In total, more than 40 states allow NIL deals for high schoolers, according to Opendorse, an athlete marketing firm.
NIL is only one example of how changes in college sports, where it’s become routine for players to transfer to another school on a moment’s notice and receive large paydays, have seeped into high school athletics.
In March, the league changed its longstanding transfer policy to allow student-athletes one penalty-free transfer.
Senators approve lifting NIL restrictions on SC colleges after gun debate puts bill in timeout

When the NCAA first permitted personal branding and sponsorship deals in 2021, it provided few guidelines, leaving lawmakers around the country grappling with how to handle them.
South Carolina legislators initially responded by simply suspending state law prohibiting the deals. Then last year, the head coaches of Clemson and South Carolina’s football programs asked legislators for clarity with a bill allowing them to represent student athletes. After getting briefly held up by a gun debate, the bill became law in May 2024.
It was approved as a way to help students navigate contracts and not get swindled. But legislators still didn’t like the idea of NIL deals. Senators who complain the transfers and million-dollar payouts have ruined college sports include Bennett.
The avid Gamecocks fan vowed to keep it out of high school sports.
The league’s prior wording wasn’t strong enough: Giving NIL “a wink or a nod certainly invites it,” he said.
Recent examples of high-dollar influence in college include an $8 million offer for South Carolina quarterback LaNorris Sellers to leave the Gamecocks, according to an article published Monday by the Athletic. The offer depended on him playing for two more years for the unnamed school, his father told the publication. Sellers, however, declined. He’s staying in Columbia.
Scott Earley, president of the South Carolina Coaches Association, said he’s against high school athletes getting paid, though he says it is happening.
The league is doing all it can to control the influence of money in high school sports in South Carolina, he said.
Singleton said the league can’t legally do anything more.
During an interview with the SC Daily Gazette, he used the example of a musical prodigy who happened to be a high school softball player.
If somebody wants to offer that athlete a contract to play the violin, the High School League has no right to stop it, he said.
“If you aren’t using the intellectual property of the school, which is the name, the mascot or the logo, why can’t you be an accomplished violinist who is playing on a team?” Singleton asked rhetorically.
Bill Carter, the head of Student-Athlete Insights, an NIL consulting firm that has worked with many high schools, colleges and high school athletic associations, called the proviso “pretty extreme.”
“The other states don’t get into very aggressive language of what they are going to fund,” he said.
Carter said it could also lead to a legal challenge.
Should that happen, recent examples signal courts will side with the youth.
“It’s the playbook that’s been run from the NCAA on down,” Carter said. “What we’ve learned is that the courts are never going to accept there’s an impediment to a young person’s ability … to earn income by way of their name, image and likeness.”
In 2021, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that said the NCAA’s restrictions on providing non-monetary compensation for academics, like free laptops or paid post-grad internships, violated antitrust laws. That decision paved the way for NIL.
Earlier this month a judge approved a settlement that ended three separate antitrust lawsuits against the NCAA, allowing schools to spread $20.5 million, a figure that will grow annually, to its athletes.
And last year in North Carolina, a judge sided with a star quarterback when his mother sued the state Board of Education on his behalf, making it so high schoolers in the Tar Heel State could profit from NIL.
“The court says, ‘You are overreaching your authorization or jurisdiction that would allow their young person’s right to earn income,’” Carter said.
Rep. Jackie “Coach” Hayes, a member of the House budget-writing committee, led his teams to seven state championships during his nearly 30 years as the Dillon Wildcats’ football coach.
Prior to coaching, he played high school football, as well as baseball and running track. He’s among the contingent against NIL in high school sports.
“If you pay them in high school, they are going to worry about how many times they run the ball, how many catches they get or how many touchdown passes,” Hayes told the SC Daily Gazette. “We got enough ‘me’ in this world. We need to get everybody working together for a common cause.”
As for the league’s wording change, Bennett said Friday he hasn’t had a chance to review it yet.
However, “as long as the High School League is acknowledging we shouldn’t be participating in this mess,” he’s satisfied that it’s meeting the intention of the budget clause he proposed.
And the possibility of a lawsuit doesn’t surprise him: “Anything done from a regulatory standpoint invites a legal challenge.”
But he said that can’t deter lawmakers from making policy in the best interest of the state and children. “Sometimes you just have to take a stand,” he said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/house.chamber.football.illustraiton.001-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-20 12:12:15.200829

The bill didn't reach the floor of either chamber in 2025. (Provided by Rick Osbon)As the 2025 legislative session concludes, South Carolina lawmakers can point to meaningful progress on consumer choice and freedom issues, working to advance long-awaited income tax cuts and passing tort reform that will benefit residents statewide.
But amid these victories, the Legislature failed to act on a commonsense measure that would empower South Carolinians at the most local level: the South Carolina Financial Freedom Act.
At its core, this bill is about extending those same principles — choice, competition, and fiscal responsibility — to local governments’ management of taxpayer dollars.
Just as individuals should have more freedom in how they save, invest, and spend, so should the cities, counties, and school districts that serve them daily.
And that’s exactly what the Financial Freedom Act seeks to accomplish.
Though H.3221/S.60 was not passed this year, the Palmetto Public Deposits Coalition (PPDC) reflects on this session as one of significant momentum in our effort to give local governments greater flexibility and financial choice.
The Financial Freedom Act, championed by Rep. Nathan Ballentine and Sen. Sean Bennett, steadily gained ground, attracting new bill sponsors, receiving a Senate Banking and Insurance subcommittee hearing, and raising broad awareness about a policy change that would give public entities more tools to deliver better outcomes for taxpayers.
The bill would do one simple thing: allow public entities to deposit taxpayer dollars in credit unions.
These institutions already serve millions of South Carolinians with mortgages, car loans, and small business financing.
Enabling local governments to use them would create healthy financial competition, expand access to local banking options, and allow the free market to deliver better interest rates, stronger returns, and smarter stewardship of public funds.
That need for competition is especially urgent when you consider where public money is currently going.
As much as 78% of all deposits in South Carolina last year were put into banks headquartered in another state.
That means the vast majority of South Carolinians’ dollars — often taxpayer funds — are managed by institutions with no stake in our local economies. By contrast, credit unions are locally governed and mission-driven, with a proven track record of reinvesting in the communities they serve.
Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to speak directly to members of the Senate Banking and Insurance subcommittee about the practical impact of this change.
I shared my perspective not only as chairman of the coalition, but also as the former mayor of Aiken and former president of the Municipal Association of South Carolina.
My message was simple: too many communities are locked into limited banking choices, even as branches continue to close across the state.
In fact, bank closures remain a growing concern.
TD Bank recently announced the shuttering of branches in Columbia and Greer — part of a national trend that saw over 140 net bank branch closures in the first quarter of 2025 alone.
When public entities are barred from banking with credit unions, they’re often forced to do business with institutions outside their communities — ones that may not reinvest locally or offer the best value for taxpayer dollars.
As Greg Habib, mayor of Goose Creek, wrote earlier this year, “Financial convenience for local governments isn’t just a banking issue — it’s a community issue.”
Habib’s words reflect what many local government leaders experience: the inability to choose the best local financial partner often leaves public funds managed from afar, rather than reinvested back into our own communities where those dollars originated.
That’s why the Palmetto Public Deposits Coalition has spent the past year engaging stakeholders, legislators, and the public to make the case for this reform.
As we prepare for the 2026 legislative session, we’re expanding that effort, working closely with the Municipal Association of South Carolina and the South Carolina Association of Counties to educate their members about the real financial benefits this policy could unlock.
From taxpayer savings to improved access and responsiveness, the case for action grows stronger every day.
This is not about picking winners and losers. It’s about fairness, competition, and allowing local governments to choose the best financial partners for their communities.
South Carolina’s financial system should reflect those values because strong local institutions build strong local economies.
There’s still time. With continued public support and growing legislative interest, the Financial Freedom Act can be part of South Carolina’s path forward.

Six of the 175 license offices in Missouri are closed because no contractor is willing to operate them. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)When the state announced the Caruthersville license office was going to close, residents needing to renew registrations or driver license were directed to the closest open offices in Kennett, New Madrid and Malden. 
Those communities are all at least an hour, round-trip, from Caruthersville. The inconvenience would be compounded if, after waiting in line, the transaction couldn’t be completed for lack of a required document.
The Missouri Department of Revenue was quick to note motorists renewing vehicle registrations — but not new vehicle registrations or drivers license transactions — could do so online. 
But the situation in Caruthersville is not unique, as a growing number of license offices around the state are shuttering — currently at least six of 175 — with dozens more operating under an expired contract.
A bill sponsored by state Sen. Sandy Crawford, a Republican from Buffalo, and awaiting action from Gov. Mike Kehoe, would increase the fees received by the license offices by 50%.
The transaction fee for a drivers license or motor vehicle would go from $6 to $9 for the shortest period and from $12 to $18 for the longest, six years for a drivers license and two years for a vehicle registration.
The fee on transactions is in addition to the state charge for titling and registering a vehicle and obtaining or renewing a drivers license.
 Sen. Sandy Crawford, a Republican from Buffalo, listens during Senate debate of an initiative petition bill on Feb. 12 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The goal is to make the offices attractive to contractors and avoid closures, Crawford said during a House committee hearing in April.
“I live in a small town, and if my license bureau were to close, I would likely have to drive 45 minutes, take a half a day to drive and get my license,” Crawford said. “And so I would much rather pay $3 than take off half a day and drive 45 miles or 45 minutes to get this done.”
There is supposed to be at least one license office in every county.
“Many small agents in rural communities have stated they are closing or not rebidding upon contract expiration,” said Ryan Williams, the license office contractor in Gladstone in Clay County. “Hopefully this increase will help enough to keep them open and solvent.”
Williams is also the legislative chair of the Missouri Association of License Offices.
The smallest office currently closed is in Unionville, in Putnam County on the Iowa border. The nearest open office is in Milan, a 50-minute round-trip. The busiest is the South Springfield License Office, which processed more than 100,000 transactions in fiscal 2024. There are two other offices within five miles.
The other offices currently closed are in Cuba, Willow Springs, Sedalia and Palmyra.
 Financial challenges

License offices, also known as fee offices for the transaction fees they charge, at one time were awarded by governors as political patronage. Until 2005, there were a dozen state-operated offices in the largest cities.
A bidding and contract system was created in the following years. The fees have been raised twice previously this century, in 2003 and 2019. There are currently 16 license offices listed on the state purchasing website, including Caruthersville and Unionville, which is on for the second time this year.
“We’re the only direct interaction that most people have with the state of Missouri,” Williams said.
In fiscal 2024, license offices processed almost 9 million transactions and charged $58.4 million in fees.
The Unionville office generated $28,736 in fees on 4,519 transactions. The Caruthersville office took in $119,260 from 18,747 transactions. And the South Springfield office received fees of $702,290 to process 105,516 transactions.
The reputation of license offices is not good, as seen by comments of members of the House Commerce Committee during the April hearing.
“If I had $1 for every time my office got called for the unpleasantness of the Rolla, Missouri, office, I’d be a millionaire today,” said state Rep. Tara Peters, a Republican from Rolla in her third year in the legislature.

State Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican, said he was glad lawmakers get special service for their license plates, which have legislative identifiers. There are two two license offices in Branson.
“I’m so glad that as a representative, I get to do the things right here in the Capitol that I need to do so I can continue to serve the people instead of wait an hour and a half in line without a bathroom,” Seitz said.
During the hearing, Williams said the contract office system saves the state money.
“If the state took it over, it would be a considerable expense,” he said.
The facilities and staffing are dependent on the amount of fees an office generates, Williams said. The contractor must meet payroll, pay rent and cover office expenses from the fee revenue.
“When you have long wait times, that’s a direct result that we can’t afford to hire the staff that we need, or pay them or attract the staff that we need,” Williams said.
 Administrative issues

The issues forcing contractors to give up their offices aren’t all financial, said Terri Harris, owner of Elle Management in St. Louis. At one point, Harris operated nine license offices around the state and was the contractor at South Springfield when it closed.
The contract had been repeatedly extended, for short periods, leaving her with uncertainty about the future and making it difficult to hire staff, she said.
After 34 years in the business, including almost two decades managing license offices for others, health issues and working through bureaucratic and political issues with the department became too much, she said.
The fee increase in 2019 was welcome, Harris said, but came just before the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The first thing I did when we got that increase is I brought my employees’ wages up to where I could stay competitive,” Harris said. “After COVID, everything changed for all employers, and my offices were large. It required a lot of employees, and frankly, the increase that I could afford to make was eaten up when you wait 17 and a half years for an increase.”
When she surrendered the contract, Harris said, she was offering $20.50 an hour to employees.
“We couldn’t keep people at that pay rate,” she said.
The fee increases will not induce her to return to the business of operating license offices, Harris said.
The South Springfield office was on an extended contract, but the extensions were short. That uncertainty also made staffing difficult, she said. 
“We went through years of being extended, two months, three months, maybe four months at a time,” she said. “That was ridiculous.”
She was reluctant to seek new contracts because the requirements being added didn’t work in the office situations she dealt with, Harris said. Specific performance numbers for managers, who Harris wanted supervising rather than processing transactions, was one issue, she said.
“The relationship became adversarial,”
 Initial contracts are generally for five years and the bill before Kehoe allows an extension of five years at the discretion of the director of revenue.
The bill would also bar department employees from becoming contractors or part owners of a license office company for a year after leaving state employment.
The department should figure out how to give more support to the small, rural offices where fee income is low, Harris said.
The contract requirements for the Unionville office call for it to be open 24 hours a week. It processed about four transactions an hour during fiscal 2024. 
“These communities, when you close an office, they’re not going 10 minutes away to the next office,” Harris said. “They’re going counties away, right to the next office. It’s it’s tough on the community period. I also understand there is a very small profit margin in them, and that makes it difficult.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Columbia-license-office-20250616-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-06-20 11:06:45.127153

The goal is simple, yet radical: to show that faith—when rooted in shared values like compassion, justice, and responsibility—can bridge divides and rebuild communities.
But there’s a catch: it takes courage. Healing polarization doesn’t just require dialogue; it demands confronting hard truths, crossing boundaries, and taking bold action for the common good.
That’s exactly what unfolded recently at Duke Divinity School, where I traveled from my native Bolivia to join young faith leaders from more than a dozen countries. We gathered with the Muslim World League (MWL)—the world’s largest Islamic NGO—not to debate doctrine, but to explore how shared spiritual values can help address today’s most urgent challenges: climate change, inequality, violence, and the erosion of trust.
The stakes couldn’t be higher. While in North Carolina, I learned that residents are deeply divided on many fundamental issues, as evidenced by recent Meredith College surveys. The same is true across the United States, where divisions over core values are at historic highs, according to Gallup.
In my home country of Bolivia, political polarization has intensified following a disputed presidential election. Globally, the situation is even more alarming: the world is now facing 56 active conflicts—the highest number since World War II, according to the Global Peace Index.
While politicians point fingers and tech platforms struggle with misinformation, the MWL and those of us in the Faith for Our Planet (FFOP) Fellowship discussed and debated a different path. We spent a week forging genuine human connections, seeking moral clarity, and focusing on values that transcend religion and nationality —empathy, responsibility, and stewardship of our planet.
These ideas were underscored by the MWL Secretary-General Mohammad al-Issa during his visit to the Triangle. He reminded us that over 84% of the world’s population identifies with a religion. That shared moral foundation, he argued, could be the key to building collaboration in a fractured world.
We’ve already seen this potential realized. Earlier this year, the MWL convened a groundbreaking gathering in Islamabad, Pakistan. In partnership with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, they brought together Islamic scholars from across the ideological spectrum to address one of the Muslim world’s most sensitive issues: girls’ education.
It wasn’t an easy conversation. Many participants, including conservative Afghan tribal leaders with ties to the Taliban, arrived with worldviews shaped by years of conflict. But the MWL believed that faith could guide even the hardest discussions.
Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai, who survived an attack by the Taliban at age 15 for advocating education, joined the dialogue. The result? The Islamabad Declaration—affirming the irrevocable right to education for all Muslim girls.
This wasn’t just a policy win—it was a moral breakthrough. Achieved not through pressure or compromise, but through a shared conviction that faith, at its best, upholds human dignity.
If such an agreement is possible in Islamabad, why not in North Carolina? Why not on issues like voting rights, gun safety, or climate justice? Why not in Bolivia? We face similarly urgent challenges that require genuine moral courage and collaborative leadership.
Too often, we act as if our problems are unsolvable. They’re not. What we lack isn’t solutions—it’s the will to act on our values. That’s why the work at Duke matters. It offers a model of interfaith cooperation rooted in action, not just conversation.
Across North Carolina, on my first-ever trip here, I learned about faith communities already working together on food security, refugee resettlement, and climate resilience. They prove that common ground is not a fantasy—it’s already here, waiting to be embraced.
It’s a vision that begins not with politics or profit, but with people—people willing to listen, to lead, and to risk discomfort for the greater good. People of Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and other faith traditions united by a shared moral vision and the bravery to act.
Could what began as a conversation among faiths in Durham become something far louder, broader, and more powerful? Let us pray that it does.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Youth-interfaith-leaders-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-20 11:06:45.127153

How many in your town?,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/20/ct-electric-vehicles-town-data/,"There are more than 60,000 electric vehicles — including plug-in hybrids — in Connecticut, a 2,481% increase since 2014.","Electric vehicles sharply increased in popularity over the past decade, and while 2.7% of all registered vehicles in the state are classified as EVs, some parts of Connecticut are more likely to drive electric — especially in Fairfield County.
As of December 2024, there were 60,489 EVs — defined as all-electric, plug-in hybrid, range-extended EV or fuel cell vehicles — registered in Connecticut, according to EV Connecticut, a 2,481% increase since 2014. 
Fairfield County is home to the top two towns for EV ownership — Weston and Westport — with 10.1% and 10.4% percent of registered vehicles classified as EVs.
Teslas account for 35.4% of all EVs registered in Connecticut as of Dec. 31, 2024, according to EV Connecticut. Other manufacturers don’t even come close; Toyota takes second but accounts for only 9.5% of all registered EVs statewide. 

As the state continues to encourage residents in the market for a car to buy electric, President Donald Trump’s proposed spending bill could cut federal EV tax credits completely. The bill proposes annual federal registration fees on electric and hybrid vehicles to go towards highway and road maintenance. 
The state offers credit on qualifying EVs under the Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate, falling somewhere between $750 to $1,500, depending on the type of vehicle. This program is part of the state’s commitment to clean air goals, and for “creating cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable communities,” according to the EV Connecticut dashboard.
And to make EV purchases more equitable, the state offers an additional credit program called Rebate+. Qualification for the program is determined by either income level, participation in federal assistance programs or location of residence. 
So with Rebate+ and CHEAPR, those in the market for an EV who qualify can receive up to $4,500 from the state. 
The cheapest model from Tesla, the most popular EV manufacturer in both the state and the nation, costs over $40,000.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-18-at-2.37.29-PM-1024x750.png,,,2025-06-20 11:06:45.127153

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas Bureau of Investigation initiative is expected to change the state’s sexual assault evidence kit process so that survivors are no longer left in the dark.
As early as 2026, sexual assault survivors, health care facilities, law enforcement agencies, forensic science laboratories and attorneys’ offices in Kansas will be able to track the status of a sexual assault evidence kit, also known as a rape kit, through an online system. Kansas is among the last states in the country to adopt such a system.
KBI director Tony Mattivi told a group of legislators about the new approach at a June 10 hearing on interagency cooperation before the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency. The tracking system will offer real-time information on the status and location of an evidence kit.
“That, I think, will help ensure transparency and accountability in a way that has never been seen in our lab before,” Mattivi said, “and we’re very proud to be working to provide that to the citizens and crime victims in Kansas.”
Kansas is a late adopter of kit tracking systems. The majority of states across the country, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., adopted some sort of system by 2024, but Kansas is one of around a dozen states that haven’t, according to data from End the Backlog, a project by the national nonprofit Joyful Heart Foundation.
Tracking systems are one of a handful of transparency initiatives that End the Backlog recommends agencies adopt. Those recommended initiatives arose after a major push in the 2010s to eliminate massive backlogs of untested rape kits sitting under the purview of law enforcement agencies. The KBI claimed in 2021 to have zero untested kits, compared to 2,220 untested in 2017. KBI did not provide updated untested kit numbers for this story.
Once the program is available in early 2026, Kansans can access information on the kits through a web portal, and the tracking process begins from the moment a nurse receives an evidence kit.
Hospitals will be stocked with kits with barcodes that a nurse can scan into the system. Once in the system, law enforcement is automatically notified that the kit is ready to be picked up, said Melissa Underwood, a KBI spokeswoman.
“From there, the system tracks the status of the kit as it moves from the law enforcement agency to a forensic science laboratory for testing, and then back to the law enforcement agency,” Underwood said.
Attorneys’ offices will receive notice when forensic lab reports are available to be used as evidence.
“Finally, the system will provide the survivor with anonymous login access so they are able to track the status of their kit as it moves through the process,” Underwood said.
The KBI contracted with a third-party vendor, Porter Lee Corp., to provide the system for $240,000 through the first quarter of 2026.
Sen. Michael Murphy, a Sylvia Republican and one of four senators who attended the efficiency committee meeting, said that initially, he hadn’t thought of a tracking system as a solution, but he has heard frustration from constituents who know nothing about evidence kits they submitted in the wake of a sexual assault. He expressed approval for the change.
“I think that’s real important,” he said.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)The U.S. Conference of Mayors is holding its annual meeting in Tampa this weekend, and one of the resolutions they are poised to vote on calls upon federal authorities to focus their deportation actions on convicted criminals, and not on undocumented individuals who “contribute to their local communities.”
That’s according to Andy Ginther, mayor of Columbus, Ohio, and the conference’s sitting president.
Ginther spoke on Thursday at a press conference held at the Tampa Marriott Water Street on the first day of the four-day event. There are 179 mayors from across the country who have gathered for the annual summer meeting, where they will participate in panel discussions on issues such as handling natural disasters, homelessness, and public safety, to name a few.
Resolution
The resolution regarding immigration has three main planks:

Delineates the appropriate roles of local and federal officials in protest response.
Calls on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to focus its deportation actions on convicted, serious criminals, and not on undocumented “hard-working individuals who have families and pay taxes and contribute to their local communities.”
Urges federal officials to notify local authorities in advance of any planned ICE actions, and to conduct those actions in “as orderly and unprovocative way possible.”

Fresno, California, Mayor Jerry Dyer served 40 years in the Fresno Police Department, the last 18 as chief. He said at the press conference that one of the things he’s learned is that for police officers to be effective they must be seen as a welcome presence and not “as an occupying force.”
“Unfortunately, what we are seeing today in many cities across America, including L.A., is an occupying force, and that is federal agents and now our U.S. military,” he said. “And, unfortunately, the Los Angeles Police Department is having to be brought into that situation.”
“I do think that our friends over at HIS (Homeland Security Investigations) and ICE need to modify how they approach immigration enforcement in our cities, and the truth is the tactics need to be changed,” he added. “The uniforms need to be modified, and I really believe there needs to be better coordination with local law enforcement.”
  Jane Castor via City of Tampa.
Tampa Mayor Jane Castor, host of this weekend’s conference, served on the Tampa Police Department for 31 years, the last six as chief. She echoed Dyer’s remarks, arguing that collaboration between local neighborhoods and the police department is built on a “foundation of trust.”
When that trust is eroded, crime rises, she said. Why? Because when some in immigrant populations become victims of crime, they aren’t comfortable in reporting that because they no longer trust law enforcement.
“That is the fundamental reason that local law enforcement should not be engaged in immigration enforcement,” she declared.
Backlash in San Diego
San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria said he is still unhappy about an ICE raid that place in his city’s South Park neighborhood late last month on a Friday evening, when dozens of ICE agents raided a popular Italian restaurant to round up and ultimately arrest four people, according to the website CalMatters.
“It was explained to me that they were looking for a handful of dishwashers, busboys, and waiters and waitresses,” he said. “None of them are known to have any serious criminal offenses.”
Agents used flash-bang grenades and intimidated patrons with their aggressive presence, Gloria said. And he criticized the lack of coordination between federal agents and local law enforcement.
“My officers were called to respond to that situation,” he said. “The radio calls were for hundreds of people in the streets that were protesting and blocking traffic. … That lack of coordination … puts everybody at risk, including the federal agents who were doing their job that day.”
ICE officials reportedly had a warrant for 19 individuals who were employed at the restaurant and were alleged to be using falsified green cards.
Gloria noted the No Kings protest Saturday in San Diego, where media reports initially indicated as many as 60,000 came out to protest the Trump administration. “I’m pleased to tell you that there wasn’t one arrest,” he said. (Local organizers now say that there were 69,000 people at the demonstration).
“Was that raid in the restaurant focused on making our country safer, or was it focused on sowing fear in that community? Those are the things that we as Americans need to pay attention to,” added Castor.
Before he spoke about the proposed ICE resolution, Mayor Ginther discussed the decision by President Trump to send the California National Guard and U.S. Marines into Los Angeles, and said the conference stands behind L.A. Mayor Karen Bass (who was scheduled to appear at the gathering on Friday).
“The federal government’s decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles without the consent, and indeed over the objection of the governor, is an unprecedented overstep,” he said. “We must acknowledge the seriousness of the protests sparked by these federal actions. People have the fundamental right to peacefully assemble and voice their concerns. That is the cornerstone of American liberty.”
The resolution on ICE actions is scheduled to be discussed on Friday during the Criminal and Social Justice Committee, with the entire body of mayors to vote on the resolution on Sunday, according to a spokesperson for the Conference of Mayors.

Some municipalities who claim the law asks too much of them are still looking to the courts and the Legislature for relief. 
The post MBTA Communities fight lingers in courts, on Beacon Hill appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","WITH SEVERAL TOWNS opting this week to finally get into compliance with the MBTA Communities housing law, some municipalities who claim the law asks too much of them are still looking to the courts and the Legislature for relief. 
Milton and Duxbury voters at special town meetings approved zoning that would meet the requirements of the housing law that requires cities and towns served by the MBTA system to rezone to make it easier to build multi-family housing. Ipswich special Town Meeting voters rejected a citizen’s petition to overturn the town’s compliant zoning plan.  
Before 69 percent of Milton voters decided to adopt new zoning, state Rep. Richard Wells, of Milton, told Town Meeting that it’s time now for elected officials and the courts to consider the matter. 
There are no less than 40 bills on Beacon Hill right now addressing MBTA Communities from a multitude of perspectives, Wells said. It’s likely, he said, that “either judicially or legislatively, there will be changes to MBTA Communities going forward.” 
Superior Court Justice Mark Gildea, who is overseeing many of the suits challenging MBTA Communities regulations, dispensed with a core argument and a bundle of nine complaints in early June. Despite a determination from the state auditor’s office that the housing law was an “unfunded mandate” – imposing direct costs on cities and towns without including a proper funding mechanism – Gildea found that the supposed costs were too speculative and noted that there are fundings sources available from the state to help reduce the burden of increasing housing supply. 
Gildea is currently considering a lawsuit brought by 16 Milton taxpayers challenging the town’s classification as a “rapid transit community.” The group of residents argue that the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities incorrectly tethered the town’s transit status, and therefore its rezoning requirements, to the quaint single-car Mattapan High-Speed Trolley rather than the more distant commuter rail and MBTA subway stations. 
Several members of Milton’s Town Meeting referenced a June 11 hearing on the case, with proponents and opponents of the higher density plan suggesting that the judge was sympathetic to their side of the issue.  
Brian Kelley, one of the taxpayers who filed suit to challenge classification, played a clip from last week’s hearing in which Gildea asked the state’s lawyer “how’re you going to fit much more in that particular area. What’s the available land?” He added that Milton is not like Middleboro, one of the towns in the suit he dismissed, where there is a “ton of land around the station.” Gildea also asked the state’s attorney whether anyone who wrote the law had visited Milton. 
This exchange illustrated, Kelley said, why Milton is different from other rapid transit communities, or even other communities that unsuccessfully protested their obligations before Gildea earlier this spring. The land around the Mattapan Trolley stops, Kelley said, are mostly already residential, while in Middleboro new housing would not be “disrupting an existing neighborhood.” 
Town meeting member Douglas Hyne offered a different perspective. The case before the judge turns on whether it is entirely unreasonable for Milton to be classified as a rapid transit community. It feels unfair to classify the town this way, Hyne acknowledged, but the lawsuit isn’t about what’s fair. 
Gildea was being respectful of the taxpayers’ the arguments and prodding the state’s attorney, according to Hyne, but he also asked the taxpayer’s attorney, given his ruling the week before, to “tell me why you think I’m wrong, if you want, but I don’t think it’s going have a lot of effect.” 
Since the hearing, the housing office has moved to dismiss Milton’s case. 
Other cases are working their way through the courts, including an appeal from a group of Rockport residents arguing the housing law was an unfunded mandate and unconstitutional, which was rejected by an Essex County Superior Court judge in Lawrence. The residents did not have standing to sue, the judge said in dismissing the case without ruling on the underlying question. 
Gildea is also considering complaints from the towns of Carver and Wilmington. In seeking an injunction, which the housing office opposes, Wilmington argues that the state created an “impossible” and “completely arbitrary” deadline of July 14 to submit a compliant plan. Rather than tailoring the regulations to each town’s characteristics, the suit argues, the housing office is applying a “one-size-fits all” approach that ignores the work done to encourage multi-family housing in the town. 
With less than a month left until July 14, the state lists only Middleton, Marshfield, and Halifax as entirely non-compliant. Most towns that oppose the housing law have still submitted possible action plans to the state showing how they may comply in time, with an array still holding out hope for judicial or legislative intervention.

[…],"Interim LSU President Matt Lee (Piper Hutchinson / Louisiana Illuminator)This is an interview with interim LSU President Matt Lee that took place earlier this month about how the legislative session and federal changes will impact higher education in Louisiana. It has been edited for length and clarity.
You can also listen to a version of this interview on our new podcast The Light Switch.


Piper Hutchinson: The legislature has just wrapped up, and LSU got some big wins. How are you feeling about your budget situation?
Matt Lee: I’m very excited. We’re very appreciative of our colleagues in the legislature, most of them are very strong advocates for LSU, and they understand the work that we do, the value that we bring to the state, our role in workforce development and helping drive economic growth for the state. 
Overall, we came out quite well with the understanding that there was not going to be a lot of extra recurring money. And so while they kept us very stable in recurring money, we also had some significant wins in terms of one time funding. 
Hutchinson: You’ve got some one time funding for research at the Ag Center and at Pennington. Is that right?
Lee:  That’s right. So as you know, the Ag Center is one of the top ranked ag organizations in the country … and so we’re winning like crazy over there. Big work in plant sciences and precision agriculture and that kind of thing. 
Pennington, being a world class Biomedical Research Center as well, does great work related to nutrition, metabolic syndrome, obesity, these kinds of things. And given that we have ongoing health challenges in the state of Louisiana, that’s always a good investment.
Hutchinson:  I was speaking with Senate President Cameron Henry and he said the idea with that funding was to kind of help fill in the gaps for the lost federal research funding. Is it going to be enough to fill in all of the gaps?
Lee: Time will tell. That’s going to be an ongoing problem for the foreseeable future. As you know, at the federal level, they’re working on reorganizing their funding mechanisms, not only at NIH, which is where Pennington predominantly draws their funding from, but at other federal agencies, NSF, USDA, they’re all evaluating their funding programs, and we anticipate that there will continue to be some reorganization and some headwinds at the federal level. 
But the bottom line is, we are an organization that I think last year, posted over a half a billion dollars in research activity. We’re going to continue to lean in, because the innovation that we drive from those research efforts enhance the quality of life in Louisiana and beyond.
Hutchinson: And y’all got some money for some capital outlay projects as well. I think the big one was that $36 million for the library. When are we going to see some groundbreaking on that?
Lee: Hopefully very soon. I’m actually very excited about that. Everybody calls it a library, but I like to think about it as a future state learning commons that will be something more like an Information Commons, or a Digital Commons for students to go to spend their time and learn and collaborate and so forth. 
I don’t know when the exact groundbreaking is, but I have seen plans and rendering for the footprint and where it will be. We’re actively talking about how we’re going to clean up that space and basically start doing site prep. So I don’t know the actual initiation of the project, but I’m very excited about it feels like we are now closer than we’ve ever been before to making progress on that. 
Hutchinson: Outside of the budget. I think the big debate this session was transferring the University of New Orleans from the University of Louisiana system to the LSU system. The legislature has given their approval for that. You know what happens now? What’s y’alls plan for UNO? 
Lee: The first step is I already had a preliminary conversation with the President of UNO, Kathy Johnson. I had a delightful conversation with her, and got to know her a little bit and get a little bit better understanding of that institution. Of course, we have a long history with UNO because its genesis was under the umbrella of LSU. It’s now been under another system for a while. 
The next steps, I think, will involve putting together a transition committee in which we will basically, I think, detail a set of verticals or workspaces where we have to figure out how things are going to start aligning under the LSU system. They’re actually in the process right now of reaffirmation of accreditation through the [Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.] So I think that will finish up in December, and then, best case scenario, we would submit a substantive change request, which would move it from one system to another for the next June of 2025, for that SACSCOC board meeting. 
During that working period, we’re going to be looking at the health of their academic programming, get a better sense of the state of their physical infrastructure and facilities and get a better sense of what their financial status is overall. 
And I think work with them to delineate a plan that will give us, I think, what we all really want, which is New Orleans is a great global city, and it deserves a great public institution that not only helps develop talent and serve as a workforce pipeline, but that also is appropriately conducting research to help solve problems within the city, or to help give industry within the city the types of innovative tools they need to accelerate their work and engage in economic growth.
There’s not a crystal clear playbook on how this plays out, but the bottom line is, I think we all desire an end state where the city itself has a valuable institution that everybody can look up to and can engage with and feel like is a tremendous asset for the city.
Hutchinson: I have been getting a lot of questions about whether we are going to see UNO in purple and gold. Do you have any thoughts about the branding of the university?
Lee: My main thought is that that’s going to be a task for the transition committee to work through. There’s lots of questions about, you know, should it retain its name, or should it become LSU New Orleans? Should it retain its color branding and so forth? 
I’m not going to speak to any of that directly at the moment, but those questions are, since we’ve run in some of the same circles, those questions are circulating among that crowd. What I can tell you is that LSU has one of the best brands in American higher education and in fact, globally, and it’s not just due to our athletics programs, it’s also due to our outstanding academic programming and the increasing brand recognition we’re getting for our research programming as well. 
So we’re very proud of the LSU brand. It’s quite flattering that we have colleagues in state government who would look to us to help them take an institution and help get it to a place where they feel like it’s fulfilling its mission a little bit more clearly and a little bit more strongly.
Hutchinson: I think one of the big victories for faculty statewide, not just at LSU, was the passage of a bill that reforms the Optional Retirement Plan of the Teachers Retirement System of Louisiana. These reforms have been wanted for decades, and the legislature has stalled them. Now we’re finally getting some traction on that. Do you have any thoughts on how that’s going to help recruit and retain faculty? 
Lee: We need as many tools as we can get to retain faculty. For sure, we actually do very well on the recruitment front, especially when we’re bringing in faculty at the front end of the pipeline as assistant professors. We do a really good job there. 
But too frequently what happens is, they come here, we give them a set of tools, they become very successful, and then they start getting picked off by our competitors. The reality is, when you are an elite and high performing research institution, there’s a lot of mobility of faculty among these institutions, because it’s so competitive. And so this legislation will give us another tool to be successful in terms of retaining them. 
Hutchinson: Another victory that I think is going to hit across higher ed in the state is legislation that’s going to give some money to athletic departments, LSU and other Division I athletic programs, and they’re also going to start studying name, image and likeness issues. What are your thoughts on the future of athletics and how this legislation is going to assist the university? 
Lee: So higher education is fascinating in that it’s always in a period of change, yet it is generally slow to move in change. Athletics is an area where this is not the case. This has been a rapidly evolving landscape. Luckily, we have some, I think, of the best athletic administrators in the country working here. We have excellent leadership over that program.
So they’ve been reading the landscape for the last couple of years and anticipating how it was going to end up shaping up in terms of the evolution of NIL, so I think we’re in good shape under their leadership. College athletics will look different going forward, but I think we have a good handle on it. 
I just met a week or two ago with the SEC presidents, and we spent a lot of time talking about what this will look like for all of us, but I think at the end of the day, the House settlement was just approved, and we have a very clear set of guidelines about what will happen next. 
Everybody in the state wants LSU to have a successful athletics program. It provides for us tremendous national and international visibility. And I’m just very thankful both for the work that the legislature has done to support us in this effort and for our outstanding athletics administrators, because they’re really good. They’ve been at the forefront of this. 
Hutchinson: Well, they made it to Omaha. 
Lee: Yes, they are. We’re looking forward to it where we’re going to win. That’s my prediction. 
Hutchinson: I think everybody hopes so. 
Lee: You have to believe, Piper. You can’t just hope. You have to believe.

The firm — to be called BDGR P.A., will offer services across a wide range of practice areas, including civil rights, criminal defense, family law, estate planning, and government affairs.
Each of the lawmakers is an attorney who has been working for years in the legal field. Rayner gained notice in 2018 when she represented the family of Markeis McGlockton, an unarmed Black man who was gunned down in Clearwater in a dispute over a handicapped-accessible parking spot by a man who invoked Florida’s controversial “stand your ground.” 
She was elected to the Florida House in 2020, and has already declared her candidacy for the Florida Senate District 19 seat next year.
Gantt is a former public-school teacher who taught in Miami-Dade County and later became a Broward County public defender before opening her own law firm. She was elected to the Florida House in 2022.
Bracy-Davis is from west Orange County. She served as an attorney with the Florida Department of Children and Families and was first elected to the Florida House in 2022. She is now a candidate in the Florida Senate District 15 seat that has been vacant since the late Geraldine Thompson died earlier this year. That primary election will take place next Tuesday.
In a joint statement, the three legislators say that “nothing happens by chance.”
“Our journeys have combined for us to be more powerful together than separately. We look forward to representing the people of Florida, not only in the legislature but also in the courtroom — from the Panhandle to the Keys.”

(Photo by Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Many State Capitols Have Security Holes

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.










People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated. It's an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.


– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
NM lawmakers review security practices after Minnesota assassination

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas Bureau of Investigation initiative is expected to change the state’s sexual assault evidence kit process so that survivors are no longer left in the dark.
As early as 2026, sexual assault survivors, health care facilities, law enforcement agencies, forensic science laboratories and attorneys’ offices in Kansas will be able to track the status of a sexual assault evidence kit, also known as a rape kit, through an online system. Kansas is among the last states in the country to adopt such a system.
KBI director Tony Mattivi told a group of legislators about the new approach at a June 10 hearing on interagency cooperation before the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency. The tracking system will offer real-time information on the status and location of an evidence kit.
“That, I think, will help ensure transparency and accountability in a way that has never been seen in our lab before,” Mattivi said, “and we’re very proud to be working to provide that to the citizens and crime victims in Kansas.”
Kansas is a late adopter of kit tracking systems. The majority of states across the country, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., adopted some sort of system by 2024, but Kansas is one of around a dozen states that haven’t, according to data from End the Backlog, a project by the national nonprofit Joyful Heart Foundation.
Tracking systems are one of a handful of transparency initiatives that End the Backlog recommends agencies adopt. Those recommended initiatives arose after a major push in the 2010s to eliminate massive backlogs of untested rape kits sitting under the purview of law enforcement agencies. The KBI claimed in 2021 to have zero untested kits, compared to 2,220 untested in 2017. KBI did not provide updated untested kit numbers for this story.
Once the program is available in early 2026, Kansans can access information on the kits through a web portal, and the tracking process begins from the moment a nurse receives an evidence kit.
Hospitals will be stocked with kits with barcodes that a nurse can scan into the system. Once in the system, law enforcement is automatically notified that the kit is ready to be picked up, said Melissa Underwood, a KBI spokeswoman.
“From there, the system tracks the status of the kit as it moves from the law enforcement agency to a forensic science laboratory for testing, and then back to the law enforcement agency,” Underwood said.
Attorneys’ offices will receive notice when forensic lab reports are available to be used as evidence.
“Finally, the system will provide the survivor with anonymous login access so they are able to track the status of their kit as it moves through the process,” Underwood said.
The KBI contracted with a third-party vendor, Porter Lee Corp., to provide the system for $240,000 through the first quarter of 2026.
Sen. Michael Murphy, a Sylvia Republican and one of four senators who attended the efficiency committee meeting, said that initially, he hadn’t thought of a tracking system as a solution, but he has heard frustration from constituents who know nothing about evidence kits they submitted in the wake of a sexual assault. He expressed approval for the change.
“I think that’s real important,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5020028-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-20 10:06:43.702314

The divisions we face are real. But by embracing civility, demonstrating respect, and extending grace, we can begin to heal the rifts.  
The post Why we shouldn’t give up on civility appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","OUR TODAY OFTEN seems more polarized than at any moment since the 1960s. Gone are the days of robust debate and discourse, replaced by shouting matches, social media pig piles, and a pervasive sense of resentment and anger that threaten the very fabric of our democratic society.
Even the human urge to reach out and calm tempers in hopes of restoring order are today under attack. 
Just since the beginning of the year, we’ve seen progressive anger over John Fetterman’s meeting with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. There was the outrage over the hug Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan received from Trump during a visit to her state – and her subsequent humiliation covering her face with a folder before an in-person meeting at the White House. We’ve also seen controversy surrounding California governor Gavin Newsom’s invitation of right-wing figures like Steve Bannon onto his podcast.
The responses to these figurative olive branches were brutal, with Fetterman’s actions derided as “crazy,” Whitmer’s as “weak” and Newsom’s as “arrogant.”  They remind us that perhaps the only thing more dangerous than the growing chasm between political factions might be trying to bridge it.
But in America, we should never give up on civility.
For one, the consequences are too profound. According to a 2024 Gallup Poll, 80 percent of Americans believe that the nation is more divided than ever, and a significant portion reports feeling anxious or hopeless about the future of democracy. 
When political figures and media personalities model disrespect and hostility, it emboldens the broader culture and threatens to erode the foundational skills of listening and respectful debate.
At the same time, silencing or ostracizing those with opposing opinions threatens our ability to have meaningful discourse. Often derided as “cancel culture” by those on the right, Harvard researcher Pippa Norris writes that “scholars may be less willing to speak up to defend their moral beliefs if they believe that their views are not widely shared by colleagues or the wider society.” This creates a chilling effect, where people opt for silence over honest conversation.
Recently, I attended the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation’s annual dinner, where former Vice President Mike Pence received the Profile in Courage Award. Pence was recognized for his actions on January 6, 2021, when he put his own life on the line to certify the 2020 presidential election as rioters outside the Capitol made a noose and chanted, “Hang Mike Pence!”
Some openly questioned whether he was deserving of praise for simply “doing his job.” I saw it differently. It would have been easy for Pence to capitulate to his boss’s desire or follow the crowd, but at that definitive moment he risked everything to uphold the Constitution.
So, at the event at the JFK Library, I walked up to the former vice president and told him, “My politics could not be more different than yours. But what you did on January 6th was courageous and an act of true grace.” 
Pence thanked me politely before moving on. What I didn’t expect was that later in the evening when he saw me, he thanked me again. I’m not sure if he had been surprised a Black woman with an accent in Boston had reached out to him, but it was clear my gratitude had stuck with him. Likewise, his appreciation stuck with me.
I’m under no illusions about what our exchange meant in the grand scheme of things. And yet, when we step out of our comfort zones to recognize and acknowledge that behind every opinion is a person with experiences and feelings we can begin to form a mutual respect. At these moments, bridging the divide in America seems, well, less unbridgeable.
There are steps we can take as individuals and as organizations to further this respect – whether it’s prioritizing listening over speaking, modeling civil discourse to exemplify respectful behavior, steering discussions in the media and in common society towards facts over opinion – and by developing civics education curricula in our schools that teach critical thinking, media literacy, and effective communication.
Ultimately, it comes down to us. As we navigate these turbulent times, we should remember the words of President Abraham Lincoln’s second inaugural address: “With malice toward none, with charity for all.” 
The divisions we face are real. But by embracing civility, demonstrating respect, and extending grace, we can begin to heal the rifts.

(Photo by Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.
But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 
Security measures
 


Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The state Board of Elections voted 3-2 along party lines to once again recognize the Green Party after a discussion over whether it qualified. 
Republicans supported recognition, while Democrats were opposed.
The official status means that voters can continue to register with the party. 
There are three ways to qualify for party recognition, by submitting petition signatures; having a candidate for president or governor receive at least 2% of the vote in the previous general election or having a presidential candidate on the ballot in at least 35 states. 
The North Carolina Green Party was seeking renewed recognition under the third option.
Jill Stein, the party’s presidential candidate, appeared on ballots around the country. The question at the Board of Elections meeting was whether she was on enough state ballots as the Green Party candidate. 
State law says that the voters seeking political party recognition needed to have a candidate on 35 state ballots who was “nominated by that group” in the last general election.
Stein was on ballots in at least 35 states, but ran as an independent or as the candidate of a different party in some of them.
Democrats at the Thursday Board meeting said Stein fell short of hitting the 35-state requirement because she was not identified as the Green Party candidate on all of those states’ ballots. 
Siobhan Millen, a Democrat, said allowing the Green Party recognition would open the door to other small parties seeking access by claiming they supported candidates on different state ballots even when those candidates were not their parties’ nominees.
However, Stacy “Four’ Eggers IV, a Republican, said the board should “err on the side of party access,” noting the “board’s track record in opposing third-party access to the ballot recently is quite poor.”
The state board has been sued over the last few years by third parties seeking ballot access. 
The Green Party sued the board in 2022 after it initially denied the party’s petition for recognition over questionable signatures. The board reversed its decision about a month later. 
Last year, a federal judge ordered the board to certify the Justice for All Party, which allowed presidential candidate Cornel West on the ballot. 
The Justice for All Party, along with the Constitution Party, the We the People party, and No Labels all lost their party recognition after the November election.
Voters registered with those parties, about 34,000 people, will have their status changed to “unaffiliated” in the state’s voter registration database, the state Board said in a news release.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5071581-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-20 10:06:43.702314

This story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on June 19.
WOODSTOCK — A Windsor County sheriff’s deputy has been placed on administrative leave after she was charged with domestic assault and interference with access to emergency services.
Kristinnah Adams pleaded not guilty at her arraignment in Windsor County Superior Court last Friday, her attorney, Michael Shane, said in an email to the Valley News on Wednesday.
Adams, a 2003 Hartford High School graduate and a former Hartford police officer, did not reply to an email seeking comment on Wednesday.
According to a police affidavit filed in support of the charges, Adams attempted forcefully to take away a phone from a juvenile in an incident involving physical contact on the evening of June 11 at her residence in White River Junction. Adams also is alleged to have prevented the juvenile from calling 911.
“Ms. Adams is absolutely innocent of any wrongdoing in this case,” Shane said in his email. “We are confident that the truth will be forthcoming in short order.”
Adams joined the Windsor County Sheriff’s office in July 2023, as part of Sheriff Ryan Palmer’s efforts to expand the agency’s footprint by contracting with towns for policing services.
“When we were made aware of the pending criminal charges on the morning of June 12, we immediately took steps to cooperate with Hartford police” in their investigation, and placed Adams on administrative leave, Palmer said on Wednesday.
“We take all allegations of domestic and family violence seriously,” he said, adding that “we’re going to let the criminal process move forward and play out like we would with any case.”
Adams has a checkered record in law enforcement.
She served for a period as the school resource officer in Hartford, and was tapped as the department’s “designated detective” investigating sexual assault and child abuse with the Windsor County Special Investigation Unit. She received the Unsung Hero Award from CHAD at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in 2015 “for her care, compassion and dedication through her work with victims of sexual assault.”
Adams was one of the officers involved in the arrest of Wayne Burwell in 2010 when police responded to a report of a “burglary in process” at Burwell’s address in Hartford. Burwell was experiencing a medical episode. When he didn’t respond to police, he was beaten with a nightstick, pepper sprayed, handcuffed and hauled off in a blanket.
Vermont’s attorney general subsequently cleared Adams and another officer of criminal wrongdoing. But Burwell filed a civil lawsuit against the town in 2012, alleging excessive use of force. Burwell received a $500,000 out-of-court settlement on the excessive force claim.
In 2020 while an officer in Hartford, Adams was the subject of a “Brady letter” — which requires a prosecuting attorney to notify a defense attorney when a police officer whom the prosecution relied upon in the case may have a credibility issue.
The letter, written by Windsor County State’s Attorney Ward Goodenough and addressed to an unnamed “defense counsel” in an unidentified case, reported that prosecutors “received information indicating” that Adams had been “untruthful” in regards to her whereabouts on a recent patrol shift.
Adams “was called to respond as back-up to an incident and took an unusually long time to arrive on scene and then gave a supervisor an explanation that does not appear to be supported by the facts,” the Brady letter said.
In addition, Goodenough wrote that his office had “further been notified” that in 2018, Adams had “made a fictitious illness report for a scheduled work shift.”
On Wednesday, Palmer said he was aware of Adams’ background when he hired her but that he believes in providing second chances for officers who may have blemishes on their record.
He praised Adams’ work in the county sheriff’s department, which includes courthouse security and patrol duties, according to the department’s website.
“She’s been great for us,” Palmer said of Adams. “The things that we assign her, she’s been fantastic at.”
The criminal investigation remains with the Hartford police. But because the case presents potential conflicts of interest for the Windsor County law enforcement community, the state was represented during Adams’ arraignment on Friday by the Windham County State’s Attorney Office, which will oversee the prosecution.
Separately, Palmer said he has asked the Bennington County Sheriff’s Department to conduct an internal affairs administrative investigation “in order to prevent any perception of impropriety.”

 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.

But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.

 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s gross domestic product grew more slowly over the past decade than that of all other states except for one, according to a Department of Labor and Workforce Development analysis.
The state’s GDP – the value of all goods and services – rose by only 0.4% annually on average from 2015 to 2025 when adjusted for inflation, according to the analysis in this month’s Alaska Economic Trends, the magazine published by the department’s research and analysis section. Only North Dakota has slower growth during the period, averaging 0.2% a year.
In comparison, the national annual growth rate for the period, adjusted for inflation, was 2.1% over the period, and the median growth rate — with half the states above and half below — was 1.7%
Without adjustments for inflation, the state’s growth might appear robust: an annual average of 8.2% from 2020 to 2024. But that nominal rate is misleading because the period was marked by high inflation, the analysis points out.
It focuses instead on “real” GDP, which factors in inflation. In real terms, Alaska’s total GDP peaked more than a decade ago, when oil prices were highest. There were only three years between 2015 and 2024 when Alaska showed real GDP growth — 2017, 2021 and 2022 — which also were the only years when Alaska’s growth outpaced the national average, the analysis found.
The statistics demonstrate the state’s economic vulnerability, said Sam Tappen, the state economist who did the analysis and wrote the Trends article.
“The fact that we’ve had such long-term stagnation, I think, is troubling,” he said.
 

  Alaska’s gross domestic product, in real dollars, is shown in this graph that separates the oil-dominated mining from all other sectors.(Graph from Alaska Economic Trends/Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development Research and Analysis)
 

	The statistics reflect Alaska’s dependence on oil and the price of that commodity, which depends on world markets and global events beyond the state’s control.
The volatility of oil prices has an outsized impact on Alaska’s economy, he said. “Oil just tends to push around the total,” he said.
Beyond the period of high oil prices, there were two different years of steep drops: 2015, when a plunge in oil prices caused a 9% drop in GDP, and 2020, when Alaska’s real GDP fell 7.1% amid the global COVID-19 pandemic disruptions.
Not coincidentally, other states at or near the bottom — North Dakota, Wyoming and Louisiana — are also highly dependent on oil and gas.
The good news in the statistics is that outside of the oil-dominated mining sector, the state’s real gross domestic product has been increasing. “All the other industries are typically growing pretty steadily,” Tappen said.
But even that good news is tempered by the reality that nonoil sectors of the economy depend to a large degree on oil.
That includes the strong transportation and warehousing sector, which accounts for a little over 14% of Alaska’s total gross domestic product and is among the sectors with the highest real growth. More than half of the sector’s output is directly tied to the oil industry, Tappen pointed out.
Other sectors with notable growth, averaging around 3% annually, were leisure and hospitality, construction, private health and education. The oil-dominated mining sector declined at an average annual rate of 2.6%, and the natural resources sector, which includes seafood harvesting, declined at an annual average of 3.9%, Tappen’s research found.
Gross domestic product is just one measure of an economy, Tappen’s article points out. There are other measures, including employment and income.

Cameron Parker, a Republican from Campbell, presents a bill in the Missouri House in February (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Missouri students majoring in business, biology, elementary education, psychology and nursing may soon be able to transfer more college credits between the state’s public universities.
State lawmakers negotiated a plan to make 60-credit-hour blocks in five degree programs universally transferable among public universities and community colleges in Missouri as part of a bill awaiting the governor’s signature or veto. The change is set to kick in by the 2028-29 school year.
The legislation’s original sponsor, Republican  state Rep. Cameron Parker of Campbell, has advocated for the bill for two years in hopes it can reduce the number of classes transfer students have to repeat.
“If you go to a community college in southeast Missouri and you transfer to a four year school in northwest Missouri, we want it to be a seamless transition across the state,” she told The Independent. “So if you go to any community college, you will know what any of the four-year schools are going to take.”
Parker chose the five degree programs in the bill because they were the most popular for community-college students. She sees the potential for colleges to extend similar agreements to other fields but understands the process is “daunting” for universities.
Four-year institutions have been the only pushback on the legislation — which garnered near unanimous approval from the Missouri House.
Paul Wagner, executive director of the Council on Public Higher Education, told a House committee in February that he wished the bill would allow for colleges to keep existing agreements for the five degrees intact. Wagner’s group represents Missouri’s public universities outside of the University of Missouri system.
“We still have some concerns that it is going to be throwing out the good in hopes that whatever the new thing is might be better,” Wagner told The Independent in an interview Wednesday.
But Brian Millner, president of the Missouri Community College Association, said in the House hearing that the current system is not working for students.
“Our transfer and articulation system is built on a house of cards of literally thousands of articulation agreements between a community college and a university for a particular program replicated over and over and over again,” he said. “We can do better for our students.”
Navigating these articulation agreements can be challenging, Millner said, and it increasingly hurts students who do not have a clear idea of which four-year college they will transfer to.

The issue expands beyond students and impacts Missouri taxpayers, Parker said, since many Missouri students use the state-funded A+ Scholarship Program to pay for community college. The A+ program pays for students to take 12 to 18 credit hours at a community college each semester for up to two years.
“If kids are taking 60 hours and then they’re transferring only 42, it is not fair to the kids. It is not fair to their parents, and it is not fair to the taxpayers paying for the A+ Program,” Parker said.
Since the 2018-19 school year, Missouri public universities have collaborated on a 42-credit-hour block of general education requirements, dubbed the CORE 42, thanks to a law passed by the General Assembly.
There were “fits” at the beginning of the program, Wagner said, but “implementation has worked really well.”
Parker’s legislation would expand the existing program, adding 18 more universally transferable credit hours for the five degree programs. Mirroring the implementation CORE 42,  a coordinating board of stakeholders will oversee the course-equivalency block.
As part of negotiations with universities, Parker edited the legislation to call for an equal number of representatives from community colleges and four-year institutions on the board. Her original bill called for one member per school.
The change, she said, helped tamp down some concerns and advance the bill this year.
“When everybody started coming to the table and sitting down and making these big fixes that helped everybody across the board, then I became pretty hopeful (that the bill would pass),” she said.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job.
They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020.
In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere.
As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.










In my time in politics, and as a South Carolinian, I've never seen this kind of thing going on. I think something is broken in our society. People are hurting their neighbors for no reason at all, putting people in danger, threatening people, scaring people. It's got to stop.


– South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, whose long political career includes terms as the lieutenant governor, attorney general, state GOP chairman and U.S. attorney


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022.
President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania where a bullet grazed his ear.
And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”

Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman outside of the Minnesota State Capitol Wednesday, June 18, 2025 in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)I once naively believed that the worst kind of loss in politics was at the ballot box.  
I learned the hard way about real loss in October 2002, when Sen. Paul Wellstone’s plane went down while he was traveling the state doing his job as U.S. senator and running for reelection.  
That loss shook the state and devastated his supporters. Many people said to me, “Paul spoke for me. Who will speak for me now?”  
But after some of the grief and mourning settled, something amazing happened. People turned the loss into a call for action. “Stand Up, Keep Fighting” was the motto, and a whole new generation stepped into politics declaring that they were ready to pick up where Paul Wellstone left off. 
As I try to process the horror of the assassination of Speaker Melissa Hortman and Mark Hortman, the incredibly moving message from their kids Sophie and Colin Hortman brought me back to those days after 2002. They wrote a list of activities we can do to honor Mark and Melissa, and here was the final item: “Stand up for what you believe in, especially if that thing is justice and peace.” 
To that I say yes! That is exactly what we must do.  
Sometimes a leader comes along who turns out to be the right person in the right place and time. Paul Wellstone was that person. Melissa Hortman was that person. Melissa’s impact on Minnesota and its people is huge. She was authentic, principled and strategic, not to mention funny, smart and relatable. These are ingredients for the best leaders. She built governing power by finding and encouraging a generation of community leaders around Minnesota to run for legislative office. The majorities she led governed justly, boldly and with compassion, through significant change and turmoil, finding the common good. Her hard work has put Minnesota in a good place and ready to take on the future.
She was stolen from us just as she was really getting going. That is just heartbreaking.  
But, in her leadership time here, she set a beautiful example, and always did right by Minnesota. 
So, just as with Wellstone two decades ago, we now need a thousand Melissa Hortmans. We need people to step up where she left off. People who get to climb on Melissa’s shoulders, get in there, fight for people and make a difference.  
People who will volunteer to serve their neighbors, knock on doors, join a local board, march in a rally, and, yes, run for office. And, once in office, to lead with integrity and courage. 
Will that be you?  
Sophie and Colin say it better: “Hope and resilience are the enemy of fear. The best way to honor our parents’ memory is to do something.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250618_0527-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-20 09:06:26.063566

Proposition 187, the Save Our State initiative, would bar undocumented immigrants across California from using public schools, taxpayer-funded social services and non-emergency medical care. 
“I had to get involved, so that families like mine, communities like mine, would not continue to be scapegoated or targeted,” Padilla, whose parents emigrated to the United States from Mexico, said in an interview in 2018.
That attitude put him in the political minority at the time. Backed by then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who made the campaign a centerpiece of his reelection, Prop. 187 passed with a commanding 58%, including majorities in 51 out of 58 counties. That included Padilla’s Los Angeles County, where it won by eight percentage points.
California has changed in the three decades since, a political and cultural transformation that is in many ways personified by Padilla’s career. In just a single generation, the political clout immigrants hold in California has soared. So have the legal protections afforded even to those immigrants who are unauthorized to live here. On the whole, public opinion on immigration policy, border security and the rightful role of immigrants in American life has inverted from 31 years ago. Prop. 187 was voided by a federal judge shortly after its passage, but its effect on California politics endures.


Case in point: Padilla, the reluctant young activist, is now the first Latino U.S. senator to represent California. In that role he has become one of the most visible symbols of the clash of values between the nativism of President Donald Trump’s administration and California’s liberal consensus on immigration. After last week’s jarring altercation, in which Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and briefly handcuffed, elected officials across California lined up to lionize and defend him. 
This isn’t Pete Wilson’s California anymore.
Immigration policy a ‘settled issue’ in California
Pollster Mark Baldassare has been chronicling the change for decades. In 1998, he and his colleagues at the Public Policy Institute of California began asking Californians a simple question: Are immigrants a “benefit” or a “burden” to California?
Respondents were evenly split in the first survey. Ever since, a majority — one that has grown with each decade — has come to see immigrants as a boon to our state. In February, when PPIC most recently asked the question, 72% of respondents chose “benefit.” That included 91% of Democrats and 73% of political independents, though only 31% of Republicans.
“This is pretty much a settled issue,” said Baldassarre. 
Part of that sweeping change can be explained by the state’s shifting demographics. If the U.S. is the land of immigrants, California is doubly so. More than a quarter of the state’s population was born abroad, and almost half of California’s children were born to an immigrant parent. More than half of California’s immigrants are naturalized U.S. citizens.And California’s immigrant community is diverse: 49% are originally from Latin American countries and 41% from Asia. For the past decade, more immigrants from Asia have entered California than from Latin America.
But California’s changing demographics are only part of the reason immigration politics have seen such a radical shift in such a relatively short period of time, said Adrian Pantoja, a political science and Chicano studies professor at Pitzer College in Claremont.

It’s not a law of nature that Latinos and other demographic groups with sizable immigrant populations should favor the Democratic Party. Plenty of Latinos and Asian Americans, for example, hold traditionally conservative opinions — on specific border and immigration-related policies and a host of other issues. 
Had the GOP “reached out effectively to Latinos, to Asian American voters — populations that were inclined and trending toward the Republican Party” the state GOP might still be an electoral force, said Pantoja. 
Instead, the state party hitched its political future to a ballot measure aimed at penalizing undocumented immigrants and their children — and hasn’t won a statewide race since 2006.Still, as in much of the nation, Latino support for Republicans in the last presidential election ticked up in California. In nine of 12 counties where Latinos are the largest demographic group, support for Trump increased from 4 to 6 percentage points between the last two presidential contests, depending on the county.
The legacy of Proposition 187
Three decades after that great California political rupture, the fruits of Prop. 187 are apparent in who holds power in California.
Padilla is California’s senior U.S. senator. Both chambers of the state Legislature have elected Latino leaders — Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas of Salinas and Senate President Pro Tem-elect Monique Limón of Santa Barbara. In the early 1990s, the count of Latinos in the Legislature bounced around the single digits. Today, there are a combined 42 members in the Democratic and Republican parties’ respective Latino caucuses out of 120 members. 
That rise in political power has translated to changes in policy.
In 2017, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 54, California’s sanctuary state law that largely bars state and local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. The bill’s author, Kevin de Leon, also traces his start in politics to Prop. 187.
More recently, the state has expanded Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for low-income Californians and those with disabilities, to all immigrants without legal status. Newsom signed successive expansions into law starting in 2020. 
Where Prop. 187 was authored to deprive undocumented immigrants of social services, California’s Medi-Cal expansion was its antithesis.The generational impact of that ballot measure was demonstrated in 2010, when immigrants were mobilized to vote and shift the state further to the left.By then, a quarter of the state’s electorate was Latino, said Thad Kousser, a professor of California politics at UC San Diego. 
“Latinos become this voting block that helps deliver the state to Jerry Brown, and then the state becomes Democratic in every single statewide office, in every election” since, he said.That year, Brown defeated billionaire businesswoman Meg Whitman in an acrimonious gubernatorial race, showcasing California as an outlier in the national red wave and ending a run in which Republicans won the governor’s race six times out of the previous eight elections. Democrats lost no congressional seats in California even as the party was routed nationally.By 2016, the respective leaders of the State Assembly and Senate were Latino, a first in California.

But not all efforts to reverse the conservatism of the 1990s in California have succeeded. In 2020, a ballot measure to largely reverse the state’s ban on using race, ethnicity or gender as factors in public university admissions and government grant-making failed to woo voters. In the state’s population center of Los Angeles County, a majority of Asian voters shot down the proposal while only 55% of Latino voters backed it.And immigrants or their children make up a sizable chunk of the GOP in the state capital. When voters in 2020 elected Redlands Republican Rosilicie Ochoa-Bogh, the child of Mexican immigrants, she became the first GOP Latina state senator in California’s history. Today the Republican Senate caucus has at least three members who are immigrants or whose parents were born abroad, according to their public biographies — 30% of the caucus. Before being elected to the Assembly as a Republican, Tri Ta became the first Vietnamese American to serve as mayor of a U.S. city.   
Medi-Cal rollback shifts views
Recent polling shows the latest wave of Medi-Cal expansions may have gone too far even for California’s immigrant-friendly electorate. A majority of Californians — 58% — oppose health coverage for immigrants without permanent legal status, according to PPIC’s June 2025 survey. 
Other polls show a majority of likely voters still support health insurance for immigrants.
This mixed picture emerges as California grapples with a third successive fiscal year of multibillion-dollar deficits and sharply increasing Medi-Cal costs. While those data may indicate softening political support for the boldest of California’s policies aimed at helping undocumented immigrants, it doesn’t spell a political realignment, said Kousser.
“California moved so far to the left that there’s almost nowhere to go other than the slight counter-reaction,” he said.
Baldassare of PPIC agreed, saying the Medi-Cal survey results may simply reflect a growing concern about the state’s finances. He noted that Newsom has proposed freezing enrollment.On some other measures affecting immigrants, Democratic lawmakers and Newsom have diverged. Last year the Legislature approved a bill to essentially adopt a novel legal theory to permit public college students without legal authorization in the U.S. to work on their campuses. Newsom vetoed the bill.
Anti-ICE protests: A new Prop. 187 moment?
There is some indication that California’s philosophical support for immigrants is, at least in part, accelerated by Trump. The share of respondents who called immigrants a “benefit” in PPIC’s surveys shot up during the first Trump administration and ebbed during Joe Biden’s stint in the White House. The most recent survey, the first since Trump returned to power, saw another spike.
That has some immigrant rights advocates hoping that the Trump administration’s current sweeping deportation policy will galvanize a new generation of political activists in California.
“Whether it’s post-Prop. 187 or post-9/11 for middle eastern South Asian communities, at some point you realize that you are being endlessly and inhumanely targeted and if you don’t speak up, and if you don’t practice your First Amendment rights, and if you’re not civically engaged, then you’ll be taken advantage of,” said Masih Fouladi, executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center. “I think those are really the things that brought people together then, and what are bringing people to the streets now.”

He said if he were asked a few months ago whether California elected leaders were shifting to the center on immigration, he’d have said yes. But Trump’s immigration raids in Los Angeles are “allowing elected officials to come out more strongly” against the apprehensions, he said. Christian Arana, vice president of policy at the Latino Community Foundation, was just six years old when Prop. 187 was on the ballot. He has distinct memories of marching with his family, everyone clad in white shirts, surrounded by a wide array of his neighbors chanting delightfully brash slogans about someone named Pete Wilson.
“For six-year-old me, what I understood was that my parents, my neighbors, my community was under attack because some man — in that case the governor of California — was blaming California’s problems on them,” he said. “I wonder how young children are experiencing this moment now.”Fifteen-year-old Nathon Ponce has an answer: He feels vulnerable. The rising high school sophomore at USC Hybrid High College Prep stood with his aunt several hundred feet from law enforcement as they fired projectiles and less-lethal rounds at protesters in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday. He wants to see the government create a legal pathway to citizenship for immigrants without that status, “instead of pushing them away.” 
More broadly, he was there to support his community, which “some people consider a vulnerable group, like Hispanics and low-income working people,” he said. “And I just want to show my support by, like, actually attending a protest.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125-Prop-187-Protest-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C631&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-20 09:06:26.063566

In mid-April, the U.S. Department of Interior transferred 406 square miles of land to the U.S. Army, after which the Army made the land an extension of the Fort Huachuca Army installation in Arizona. That same day, the fort’s commander issued a security regulation designating the land as a restricted area. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico then started charging people with trespassing on the land, now called the New Mexico National Defense Area.
By the #s: NM’s new military-controlled border zone is not a ‘60-foot buffer.’ It’s 400 square miles

A federal judge in mid-May dismissed charges against nearly 100 migrants charged with trespassing, who said the migrants couldn’t have known that they were entering a military zone when they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.
The two convictions announced on Thursday were against two people who had previously been apprehended in the NMNDA, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s office, which cited two federal statues used to establish criminal penalties “for unlawful intrusions into areas designated as National Defense Areas. The two people convicted were:
• Andres De Los Santos-Martinez, a citizen of Mexico, pled guilty to re-entry after deportation, after being apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents on June 1 in Doña Ana County; he was previously apprehended in the NMNDA on May 7, 2025,
• Eduardo Herrera-Juvencio, also from Mexico, was apprehended in the area twice on the same days.
“These first convictions reflect the resolve of the United States Attorney’s Office to do its part in securing our nation’s southern border,” Ellison said in a statement. “I am tremendously proud of our staff in the Las Cruces Branch Office, the U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. military for their relentless efforts to secure our southern border. This partnership is a prime example of what can be accomplished through coordinated enforcement of existing federal laws. New Mexico—and the entire country—is more secure because of these efforts.”
According to Ellison’s office, the court ordered both defendants to remain in custody pending sentencing. Upon completion of their sentences, they will be subject to deportation proceedings.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image009-1024x827.jpg,,,2025-06-20 09:06:26.063566

Rukshan Samaranayake
Rukshan Samaranayake is a postgraduate student at National University and a U.S. Army veteran.


My journey to a college degree has been filled with detours. 
After high school, I attended college for two semesters before I joined the U.S. Army. When I concluded my service as a combat engineer — deployed overseas and with two Purple Heart medals to boast — I returned to California and enrolled in community college. But financial difficulties got in the way.
Unsurprisingly, money is the primary reason most students stop or drop out of college. I was fortunate to have GI Bill benefits to pay for my education, but most Californians don’t have that option. I eventually returned to college, completed my associate’s degree and transferred to National University, where I earned my bachelor’s.
Financial aid made all the difference in my college journey — and my life. California lawmakers have the opportunity to strengthen a financial aid program that’s serving as a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Californians who are seeking a college credential to improve their lives.
This year, the Cal Grant program is supporting nearly 700,000 low- and middle-income Californians who are pursuing degrees at public and independent postsecondary institutions across the state. Two-thirds of new Cal Grant recipients are seeking to become the first college graduates in their families. Nearly a third are adult learners — many with family, job and other responsibilities — who are returning to school after time away from formal education.
Cal Grant makes it possible to pursue a credential at the institutions that have powered California’s economy for decades. Today, 56% of California adults have a postsecondary degree or credential, a nine-point increase since 2014. Enhancing the state’s financial aid program would help more Californians open up the pathways to high-wage careers that keep California globally competitive. But the award amounts from the Cal Grant program have not kept pace with the rising cost of college. 
Assembly Bill 402, which is now under consideration in the state Senate, would accomplish two critical things to support people like me who took a less traditional path.
First, by restoring Cal Grant scholarship amounts to 2001 levels, the bill would provide additional aid to eligible students. AB 402 would raise the maximum Cal Grant award to students attending independent institutions by $350 to $9,708 annually starting in 2025-26. This increase would directly support nearly 31,000 Californians attending private nonprofit colleges and universities.
Second, the bill would ensure that nontraditional students like myself who transfer from a community college to one of the more than 85 independent California colleges or universities can maintain their Cal Grant eligibility. 
In 2024, these campuses welcomed more than 3,300 community college transfer students. If transfer students can maintain Cal Grant eligibility, it would open up additional opportunities to better serve the diverse needs and realities for community college students.
Thanks to the financial aid that supported my college journey, I went from a college dropout to college graduate. In January, I earned my bachelor’s degree with distinction from National University. 
I chose to remain there to pursue my master’s while serving as vice president of the student veterans’ organization, volunteering through the California Volunteers program and supporting two military-affiliated organizations, The Mission Continues and the Wounded Warrior Project.
AB 402 represents a small investment in postsecondary opportunities that could make a big difference in peoples’ lives. Every college journey is different, but everyone should have a chance to get the financial support they need to reach the finish.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/050825_ESL-Class_JH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-20 09:06:26.063566

“It’s a complete honor to have been considered and given the opportunity to have been voted in today to be CEO of SEIB, and I am looking forward to doing everything I can have a smooth transition and keeping SEIB strong and following the mission to continue excellent benefits for members,” Azar said after the meeting.

She was appointed as commissioner of the Alabama Medicaid Agency in 2012 by former Gov. Robert Bentley.
Ashmore said that three “very qualified candidates” were selected to interview with the board, and the decision was not easy.
“I was impressed with the fact that you had one of the candidates who was the administrator of the state of Florida plan, who I’ve actually known for 25 plus years, and a very good candidate. You had the one that was selected, (who has) been Medicaid commissioner for quite some time. That’s a very large agency, and she’s proven herself over there. And we had an internal candidate that was ready to also take over on day one,” Ashmore said.
Azar will lead the insurance board at a time when the rise of health care costs is a concern. Bob Childree, a retired employees’ representative on the board, offered his support but also noted concerns about the board’s financial condition.
“I’m very concerned about the financial viability of SEIB,” Childree said.
Ashmore said after the meeting that the plan is financially sound, but for the previous 16 years, the board has not asked the Legislature for a rate raise. Ashmore said that this trend is unsustainable in the long term due to the evolving health care landscape, particularly at the federal level.
“We’ve talked about the Medicare Advantage and doubling of costs. We’ve seen plans that had their costs triple in those areas, and in order to continue to provide those benefits to our beneficiaries, which is our mission to do, we’ve got to have the funds,” Ashmore said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC01641-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 08:05:01.892770

When Louvannina Tsosie walked into The Door Christian Fellowship Church in Gallup, N.M., she expected the kind of church service she had growing up: worship, music, a sermon, prayer and some scripture reading.
What she didn’t expect was a stage performance aimed at Native people that included a condemnation of traditional Navajo beliefs — and those who embrace them.
“Unfortunately, it turned out to be a really disrespectful kind of play,” she said.
Among other scenes that trafficked in harmful stereotypes of Indigenous people, the play showcased a Diné Hataałii, or medicine man, being condemned to hell for practicing traditional Diné ways of life, including ceremony and traditional healing.
Hataałii protect and preserve all traditional ceremonies and customs of the Diné way of life, and they hold a special place of honor among the Diné people.
The Door showing the damnation of a Hataałii “wasn’t a misunderstanding,” Tsosie said, but rather a “direct attack on our beliefs and spirituality.”
The Door is an offshoot of the Potter’s House Christian Fellowship Church, which was founded in Prescott, and is part of Christian Fellowship Ministries located in Benton, Kentucky. Christian Fellowship Ministries has over 4,000 churches worldwide, with seven churches on the Navajo Nation.
“Our church here in Gallup was among the first few Southwestern works launched out of the Prescott congregation,” The Door’s website states. “From the earliest days, it has stood as a testimony to God’s power to transform lives and reach cities through evangelism, discipleship and church planting.”
The Arizona Mirror reached out to The Door and Potter’s House, but neither church responded.
The shock from the play prompted Tsosie to start recording a video of the over-the-top theatrical production on her phone. She then posted that video on her TikTok account with the caption: “The things you see in border towns.”
Her TikTok posts feature two parts of the play, which was set in a dark room with the stage illuminated by red lights, while ominous drum music plays in the background.
The music played throughout the show featured remixes of traditional songs, layered with sound effects to create a more menacing tone.
At the center of the stage,  a Navajo man dressed in traditional clothing kneels by a fire, holding an eagle feather in his hand. Kneeling next to the Navajo medicine man is an actor dressed in a demon costume, encouraging his actions.
Suddenly, another Navajo person appears, shouting at the medicine man and demanding to know what he did to his niece.
“She’s in the hospital. What kind of ceremony did you do?” the man shouts. The interaction escalates into violence, as the angry man stabs and kills the medicine man.
In the next scene, the medicine man — the murder victim — is standing at what is supposed to be the gates of heaven, surrounded by white light, interacting with an angel. That angel swiftly bars the Hataałii from heaven and condemns him to hell.

The stage suddenly bathed in red lights, demons surround the medicine man, taunting him. “Come on, let’s do a ceremony,” and “We don’t like tradition, do we?” they say.
The medicine man is laid on the floor, and the lead demon gives orders to his minions: “Let’s do a purification. I’ll purify your soul in the fiery pits of hell. Demons, take this pedophile and make him suffer.”
Since she posted the video, Tsosie said she has received an overwhelming response. The video has garnered more than 230,000 views on TikTok, with nearly 1,600 comments.
Tsosie said some of the comments in her videos claim she is taking the play out of context, misrepresenting the situation and she needs to find her way with Christ.
“It kind of felt like a big slap in my face,” she said.
Tsosie, 24, grew up in a Christian household in Tohlakai, New Mexico, on the Navajo Nation. She said she is familiar with the religion, even though she is no longer religious. She attended The Door’s service because a friend invited her.
In response to the play, Tsosie helped organize a peaceful protest across the street from the church on June 8. She said they want accountability, including a public apology. They have not received a response from the church, much less an apology.
Navajo elders and youth have reached out to her. Tsosie said the elders appreciate her speaking up about the incident because they thought they’d never see it happen. Youth have shared their feelings about forced religion and the cultural shame they encounter.
“It’s been emotional and overwhelming, in the best and hardest ways,” she said. “This moment is bigger than me, and it’s about our people realizing that we don’t have to stay silent anymore.”
‘It was absolutely revolting’
As she sat through the service, Tsosie said she noticed how utterly unbothered the predominantly Native audience was as the actors portraying the demons mocked Diné ceremonies.
“I guess it felt normal to them,” she said. “I think the painful part of the play was that most of the actors were themselves Navajo.”
Diné historian Dr. Jennifer Nez Denetdale said she has heard stories about The Door Church and how many Navajo people involved with the church actively participated in demeaning and derogatory remarks about their people.
Her niece witnessed this firsthand and never returned, appalled by their actions. Denetdale said demonizing the Diné people’s way of life is a long-term strategy of The Door Church.
Denetdale said the Navajo Nation has never really acknowledged or accounted for the extent to which the Navajo people have been Christianized since colonization began on their homeland.
“What follows the soldiers are the missionaries,” she said. “What follows the establishment of the forts is the missionaries and the priests.”
Denetdale holds a doctoral degree in history and serves as the professor and chair of American Studies at the University of New Mexico. Her research work focuses on settler colonialism, decolonization and Diné studies.
Denetdale is from Tohatchi, New Mexico, on the Navajo Nation. During her regular drives to Gallup, which is 25 miles away and the closest community with resources for many Navajo people in the area, she made it a habit to count the churches along the way.
“In that stretch, there are at least 16 Christian churches, and we’re talking about a remote area,” she said. “There’s an investment in continuing to Christianize Navajo people, and in that process, they must discount, vilify and demonize who we are and our foundation as Diné people.”
Due to how heavily Christianized the Navajo people are, Denetdale said their response to conflicts involving the church, such as what was depicted in Tsosie’s video, is often not to say anything — or to deflect by saying things like, “That’s not my church and that’s not us.”
“They don’t see it as problematic because they personalize it,” she added. “I think that’s part of the problem, and a question for all of us is to acknowledge just how Christianized we’ve become.”
Denetdale said she is not a Christian, and it is difficult for any Navajo person to say they are not a Christian because so many prominent leaders on the Navajo Nation are Christian. However, she said she is a historian and knows the history of Christianity, and “it is an ugly, ugly story.”
Denetdale said she doesn’t use the terms “culture” or “religion” to explain the Diné people’s way of life because they do not adequately describe who they are. She said that the Diné people’s knowledge and understanding of the world are rooted in a deep philosophy of Diné values.
When she saw the video, she said “it was absolutely revolting” and she shouldn’t be surprised that, in this day and age, one can showcase something that has “such incredibly grotesque depictions of Diné ways of being, and that medicine people, traditional practitioners, are demonized.”
“I’m shocked, but I shouldn’t be shocked — this is Gallup, New Mexico,” she said, a city with a long history of racism and discrimination against Indigenous people.
The City of Gallup was founded in 1881. It has been referred to as the “Indian Capitol of the World” due to its proximity to several tribal nations, including the Navajo Nation and the Zuni Pueblo Nation, whose tribal lands surround the city, as well as the significant contribution of Indigenous people to the local economy.
Indigenous people make up more than 52% of the city’s population, but like many border towns, Gallup has a history of racism and violence against Native people.
In response to public outcry, the City of Gallup released a statement indicating that, since its founding, it has been a place of diverse heritages, beliefs, and practices.
Due to the diversity of Gallup, the city stated that “conflict is inevitable,” and when it occurs, their priority is to ensure the public’s safety and that all rights are respected and protected.
The city stated it cannot intervene or take sides in matters of speech and expression. However, they can and will impose reasonable restrictions on time, place and manner in the public arena.
“Freedom of expression comes at a price,” the city wrote in its statement. “It requires an acceptance of and willingness to bear insult and offense, to hear and see what one may find hurtful or despicable.”
The Arizona Mirror reached out to the City of Gallup for comment, but it did not respond.
Navajo Nation Council issues letter to church
Navajo Nation Council Speaker Crystalyne Curley said that since the video was released, council delegates have been asked by constituents to address it. Curley called the church’s play very disrespectful.
“It was very gruesome and visual,” she said, especially with the sound effects. “They went above and beyond to do that.”
On the best way to move forward, Curley said that she consulted with faith-based leaders from various denominations and traditional practitioners to hear their perspectives on the incident.
“Many of them reiterated that this type of disrespect or depiction of discrimination should not be tolerated toward any faith,” she said in an interview with the Arizona Mirror.
Many expressed their disapproval of the church’s performance, she said, noting that it crosses the boundaries of respect among faiths.
“Navajo traditional practices are considered sacred by many of our people,” Curley said in a statement. “They are integral to Navajo identity, history, and our way of life.”
On behalf of the Navajo Nation Council, Curley issued a formal letter to The Door on June 11,  expressing disappointment and calling on the church’s leadership to take responsibility for the performance.
“As neighbors to the Navajo Nation, the City of Gallup and surrounding communities share not only a geographical proximity but also a cultural and social relationship with our people,” the letter stated. “It is within this shared space that mutual respect, understanding and coexistence must be nurtured.”
The Navajo Nation Council described the performance as a misrepresentation and mockery of sacred aspects of Navajo spirituality, stating that the portrayal is disrespectful and culturally insensitive.
“Navajo medicine men are spiritual leaders and should never be made a mockery in such a violent manner,” Curley said in a statement.
The letter calls on the church to take the concerns of the community seriously, Curley said, and she is more than willing to sit down with the church’s leaders to have a “respectful dialogue on what has happened.”
“Many of our people are still frustrated,” she said, adding that they have not received any type of response back from the church.
Curley said that it is essential to acknowledge the religious freedoms practiced on the Navajo Nation. However, she said that “freedom should never come at the expense of another person’s sacred beliefs or traditions.”
“My statement is not intended to play down or disrespect another religion, but there has to be some type of respect, even as neighbors,” Curley added. “This goes across all faiths. We have to stay respectful to one another.”
Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren has not released a statement about the incident. The Arizona Mirror reached out to Nygren’s office, but it did not respond.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Board of Education (ALSBOE) unanimously approved an emergency rule for paid parental leave for educators last week.
The rule, as outlined by SB 199, sponsored by Sen. Vivian Figures, D-Mobile, allows public education employees to take eight weeks of paid leave after giving birth, having a stillbirth or experiencing a miscarriage after 12 weeks. It also allows a father to take two weeks of paid leave under those circumstances. If a couple adopts a child under 3, either parent may have eight weeks of leave if they are both eligible employees.

The emergency rule, State Superintendent Eric Mackey said in May, allows employees who are expecting a child at the beginning of July to use the benefit. With the emergency rule, there is a 35-day public comment period before the board adopts permanent rules at its meeting on July 8.
“We’re getting a lot of questions from superintendents and CFOs but feel pretty good about implementation of that,” Mackey said at the board’s work session Thursday.
The use of the benefit revolves around the birth of the child, so any employees that have a baby before July 1, which is the effective date of the law, would not get paid leave. Mackey said an employee has a full calendar year to use the benefit, so those that have a baby in July can wait until school starts to take their leave.
Mackey said the local superintendent must approve the leave, and it should allow the parent to bond with the child. He said that a school district asked if a teacher could take every Friday off as their leave, but that does not align with the purpose of the law. There is no appeals process for any proposed leave, he said.
“But the purpose of the bill is to allow moms and dads some time to adjust to a new baby or adoption, and to bond,” he said. “Obviously, taking every Friday off doesn’t meet that need, and so I’m going to turn that down as a local superintendent.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9529-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 08:05:01.892770

(Photo by Lauren Lifke/Maryland Matters)The official swearing-in for new Prince George’s County Exective Aisha Braveboy was Wednesday. But the celebration was Thursday.
Braveboy took the oath of office a second time before hundreds of dignitaries, celebrities and county residents who packed a hall in the Samuel Riggs IV Alumni Center at the University of Maryland, College Park for the event. Many had the day off for the Juneteenth holiday — a date Braveboy said she chose deliberately.
“I said, ‘You know what? I want to be sworn in on a day that has meaning separate and apart from myself,’” Braveboy said. “This day is about emancipation. It’s about liberation. It’s about remembering how folks who look like me got to this country.” 
The two-hour event felt at times like a church meeting, at times like a political rally, at times like a reunion. There were benedictions by a rabbi, an imam and two ministers, a presentation of flags from dozens of countries represented in the county population, a musical presentation by a church choir and a serenade by sisters of Sigma Gamma Rho, Braveboy’s college sorority.
“I love my blue and gold, all that I know is there ain’t nothing like my SG Rho,” sang a group of about 20 women wearing the sorority’s signature colors.
Attendees were greeted by a wall-size poster of Braveboy with the logo, “The future is Brave,” and treated to an eight-minute video retrospective of her career. And there were speeches, by Prince George’s County Council Chair Edward Burroughs III and from actress Taraji P. Henson, who spent much of her time discussing rising youth suicide and the mental health foundation she founded in honor of her father, but said she is “excited for our partnership” with Braveboy.

Henson was followed by Gov. Wes Moore, one of many state and county officials in attendance. Braveboy was one of the first to come out and endorse Moore’s gubernatorial bid when he was a little-known hopeful in a large field of experienced Democrats seeking the governorship.
“I have had the honor of watching her work up close, and I can tell you from the work that I have already seen, you should understand why I’m so excited about the future of  Prince George’s County,” Moore said. “She’s someone who has shown that she doesn’t just have a vision for the future, but she’s someone who’s shown that she knows how to deliver upon that future as well.”
Braveboy, a former state delegate who was elected Prince George’s County state’s attorney in 2019, spoke of her time in that office, which ended with a conviction Tuesday in the disappearance and death of local teacher Mariame Toure Sylla in 2023 was an important case to her.
“What a way to end my tenure as state’s attorney,” Braveboy said.
She said she was humbled to have been elected to the office but said that, “in many ways, God elected me, too,” by placing her in a supportive and nurturing family.
Braveboy recognized previous county executives in the audience for their contributions to the county, including Jack Johnson — who was sentenced to seven years in prison on extortion charges related to development deals during his time as executive — Rushern Baker and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), whose election last fall created the opening Braveboy is now filling. She also recognized interim Executive Tara Jackson, who moved into Braveboy’s position as county state’s attorney after Braveboy was electect executive.
She promised a “unified county government,” calling out several of the council members in attendance, and promised to hold regular town halls as part of a government that is “open, transparent and will ask for your ideas.”

In her half-hour address, Braveboy presented a vision for the county that was long on optimism, but short on details.
One concrete goal is to clean up the county’s roadways, because, “We have to make sure that our roadways are as beautiful as the people in this room.” Improving the county’s presentation would also help the county become “more competitive” when it comes to attracting business and development, she said.
On that front, she said the county won the competition to be the future home of the FBI headquarters — somehting President Donald Trump has threatened to halt — “fair and square” but that the county “can wait them out” at the federal level.
Braveboy also spoke of the need to purchase more from county businesses, promising to ease the process for county companies that do business with the federal government but cannot get a foot in the door for county government or county schools contracts.
Braveboy was active even before her swearing-in, naming a new chief administrative office, an interim schools superintendent, a new police chief and a new public safety director. Over the next few weeks, Braveboy said, she plans to roll out more appointments at both the entry level and senior level, and directed people who want to work with the county, whether at a high level or an entry level, to follow the “career seeker” link on her website, www.aishabraveboy.com/transition.
“I see a future filled with promise, filled with prosperity and filled with love,” Braveboy said. “My job as a county executive is to ensure that everyone feels that feeling each and every day.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC07867-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 08:05:01.892770

Wes Moore discusses his administration's ""Just Communities"" program at Bethel AME Church in Cambridge on June 19, 2025. (Photo courtesy Governor's Office)The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland renewed its call Thursday for a commission to study reparations, even as Gov. Wes Moore unveiled a series of measures that he said would close the racial wealth gap that is a legacy of past discrimination.
It’s the latest in a debate that began with Moore’s May 16 veto of Senate Bill 587, which called for creation of a commission to study the effects of historic racism on Black residents of the state today and to recommend “appropriate benefits” ranging from an official apology to monetary benefits.
“While the steps announced today are important, they do not replace the need for reparations,” said a prepared statement from the caucus. “Addressing the racial wealth gap, health disparities, our unequal justice system, housing access, and education outcomes requires a comprehensive approach—and reparations must be central to that effort.
In his veto message, Moore said there have been many studies on historic racial inequities and that this was not the time for another study, but for action.
Lawmakers confident they can override Moore’s veto, reinstate Reparations Commission bill

He pointed to efforts under his administration to increase the amount of state business for Black-owned businesses, boost funding for historically Black colleges and universities, expand home ownership and expunge cannabis conviction records, which disproportionately affected Black residents.
Those themes were repeated Thursday, Juneteenth, when Moore traveled to the Bethel AME Church in Cambridge to tout his administration’s accomplishments and announce an expansion of cannabis commutations and the start of the new “Just Communities” program.
Moore, according to a text of his speech, said the program aims to help atone for “placed-based policies of the past like historic redlining and mass incarceration and the urban renewal of the ’80s and ’90s and unfair appraisal values – which have been some of the greatest wealth thefts in American history.”
The Just Communities program gives priority for state investment to communities that can show they have been impacted by racial segregation, state or federal redevelopment programs that seized private homes, high rates of incarceration or exposure to environmental or health hazards.
Moore identified the first 419 such communities, in 16 counties and Baltimore City, that will be eligible for $400 million in funding for communities that have been “historically impacted by exclusionary policies.”
The governor also announced an additional 6,938 pardons for conviction of simple cannabis possession — on top of the nearly 170,000 pardons he issued for the crime last year. The new cases were discovered by court officials as they continue to pore through records.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Moore said racial inequality, through restrictive policies and denied opportunities, has coat the economy $16 trillion in the last two decades, and he repeated his call to action.
“We have a remarkable lineage of scholarship on this issue. We have more data now than ever before on this topic,” Moore said. “The work of repair doesn’t require more analysis. Because we cannot afford to simply “meet” about the situation before us… and delay progress… “We need action, and we cannot wait.”
The caucus statement said it “applauds Governor Wes Moore’s announcement today and his continued commitment to improving the lives of Black Marylanders,” and said it has been a proud partner in many of hte efforts cited by Moore.
The caucus, which has vowed to override Moore’s veto of the reparations bill, said it will continue working with the governor on that progress. But is said that the progress needs to include a reparations  commission.
“As we celebrate Freedom Day and reflect on meaningful progress, we remain focused on our unfinished work—particularly the creation of the Maryland Reparations Commission … the first-ever state action on reparations in Maryland,” the statement said. “It is a historic and necessary step toward repair and true equity.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed-7-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 10:06:43.702314

(Photo courtesy of Make the Road Nevada)In Assemblymember Cinthia Zermeño Moore’s North Las Vegas district the largest source of continuous turf and trees is a private golf course, the rest of her district is largely characterized by super heating concrete and asphalt.
During her campaign to be elected last year, Moore said she walked from door to door and heard story after story of residents who have been impacted by extreme heat and the lack of adaptation strategies in the state.
East Washington Avenue, which runs through Moore’s District 11, is an example of that lack of heat adaptation strategies, said Moore. Several bus stops along the route aren’t covered by any form of shade despite the city’s routine triple digit temperatures, while 20% of the district’s population depends on public transportation or walking.
Moore said there are several strategies local governments could take to help the public adapt to extreme heat, including extending operating hours for cooling stations, planting trees and installing water fountains along bus routes, and banning utility shuttoffs in the summer.
This year, Moore sponsored a bill to restrict utilities’ ability to shut off power due to nonpayment during extreme weather months. It would also require utilities to create payment plans for struggling customers who can’t make full payments.
The measure, Assembly Bill 456, didn’t get a hearing.
“One of the biggest expenses for people is rent, followed by utilities in the summertime. I was taken back by what I was hearing. At doors people were saying that they couldn’t pay their utility bill,” Moore said at an environmental justice panel organized by Make the Road Nevada, Chispa Nevada, and the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition.
“The utilities are aware that I plan on bringing this back next session. It’s something that I’m going to be working on during the interim, and it is something that is needed in Nevada,” she continued.
Advocacy groups organized the Wednesday panel for “National Heat Week” to advocate for protections for workers exposed to extreme heat conditions.
Organizers celebrated several legislative victories this session, and also mourned legislative losses, like AB 456 the utility shuttoff bill. 
Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo did sign several environmental justice bills pushed by Make the Road Nevada, Chispa Nevada, the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, and other conservation groups.
One of those measures was Assembly Bill 96, which requires the state’s two most populous counties to actively address extreme heat through urban planning strategies, like creating public cooling spaces, public water access, cool building practices, and shaded areas in their development plans.
An environmental justice bill focused on worker protections also made the cut. Senate Bill 260 mandates Nevada OSHA to create regulations with clear protocols and employer responsibilities when wildfire smoke degrades air quality. The agency will have until next year to propose those regulations.
Jackie Spicer, the coordinator for the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, said once implemented Nevada will be one of the first states with OSHA regulations for wildfire smoke.
“We know in Nevada that wildfires are becoming more frequent, more severe and lasting longer due to hotter temperatures and the dry climate that we have in the West,” said Spicer.
“We now know it’s no longer appropriate to be sending people outside to be exposed to the toxic wildfire smoke,” she continued. 
Nevada is also one of few states with worker protection for extreme heat after Nevada OSHA implemented regulations in April. The regulations require employers to create a written plan that provides workers with portable water, rest breaks, and a way to cool down during extreme heat.
Spicer said those regulations are an improvement compared to what Nevada had a year ago. But those regulations are limited and overly vague, giving employers a lot of wiggle room. 
Nevada OSHA also has a limited number of case agents responsible for monitoring and reviewing worksites for extreme heat hazards, said Spicer.
“In Nevada we only have 40 OSHA inspectors statewide that are meant to cover every industry and every employer,” Spicer said. 
“We’ll see whether or not these regulations are actually working and making a difference, or if there’s anything that we can do to improve,” Moore added.
Advocates emphasized the need for local government action and community mobilization to address extreme heat and wildfire smoke impacts, particularly on frontline communities and low-income workers.
“These issues have real impacts, and people feel them, and cannot afford to maintain the status quo, and we have to be taking as much action and change as possible to improve people’s lives so that we can continue to live here in the long term,” Spicer said.
Yanci Hill, a member of Chispa Nevada, described an event last year when a faulty air conditioner left her and her family in triple digit temperatures for a week. Cooling centers in the area didn’t allow them to bring their dogs and closed by 5 p.m.
“We had to put one of the dogs down because he had liver disease and couldn’t take the extreme heat,” Hill said in her native Spanish. “It was so painful. She was the one that slept with me and was with me all the time.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC00342-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-20 08:05:01.892770

SPRINGFIELD — Immigration rights advocates in Illinois are anxiously awaiting the governor’s signature on legislation aimed at protecting K-12 students who may be in the country without legal authorization from being denied access to a free public education.

House Bill 3247, known as the “Safe Schools for All Act,” passed both chambers of the General Assembly in the final days of the spring session. It would prohibit schools from denying any child access to a free public education based on their actual or perceived immigration status, or that of their parents.

It would also prohibit schools from disclosing, or threatening to disclose, information about a student’s immigration status or the status of a person associated with the child. And it would require schools to develop procedures for reviewing and authorizing requests from law enforcement agents attempting to enter a school or school facility.

The bill is intended to buffer K-12 students in Illinois from efforts by the Trump administration to launch mass deportations of noncitizens living in the United States without legal authorization.

Speaking at a May 7 rally outside the Statehouse, where Democratic lawmakers and immigration rights advocates protested an appearance in Springfield that day of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, state Sen. Karina Villa, D-West Chicago, the chief Senate sponsor of the bill, vowed that Illinois would remain defiant of Trump’s political agenda.

“We are also going to protect our children,” she told the crowd gathered around a statue of Abraham Lincoln. “We’re going to make them feel safe in our schools by passing HB 3247. We are going to unite and we are going to get that done.”

On Jan. 20, the first day of the new administration, the Department of Homeland Security rescinded a Biden-era policy that prevented federal agents from conducting immigration enforcement actions in certain “sensitive” areas, including schools, churches and hospitals.

Fred Tsao, an attorney for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said during an interview that the policy change has had a chilling effect on the immigrant community, making many afraid to even show up in school.

“We have seen a decline in student participation, particularly among heavily Latino schools after this inauguration,” he said. “So we want to make sure that schools are prepared in the events that federal agents, or for that matter other law enforcement, come to their door in a nonemergency situation.”

Tsao said advocates have also been concerned about possible changes in other legal protections for immigrant students that so far have only been expressed in judicial opinions.

In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Texas statute that authorized local school districts to either deny enrollment to children who had not been “legally admitted” to the United States, or to charge them tuition, holding the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment.

Tsao, however, said there have been attempts in other state legislatures, including earlier this year in Tennessee, to pass legislation that would challenge that 43-year-old ruling. And while the effort in the Tennessee legislature fell short this year, he said advocates in Illinois wanted to act now to make sure the rights of immigrant students are protected in state law, should the Supreme Court precedent ever be overturned.

“Fortunately, our counterparts in Tennessee, the immigrant advocacy organizations and community leaders, bombarded the General Assembly with advocacy work and were able to persuade a number of legislators to vote against this legislation when it came down to it,” he said. “But you know, that's not to say that folks in Tennessee or folks in other states won't try again.”

As of Wednesday, June 18, HB 3247 had not yet been sent to Gov. JB Pritzker.

Eliminating Republican control in the House would really hobble Trump's agenda and make him a lame duck president for the last two years of his term.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Paul L. Kendall: ‘No Kings’ requires political action.","Dear Editor,


While it was wonderful to see so many people turn out for the “No Kings” rally on June 14, I left with the impression that nobody had really thought about how to use all that energy to actually accomplish its purpose.
From my experience, that energy has to be focused on changing Republican control of the House of Representatives in Washington, which can be done by defeating only a net of five Republicans in 2026.
We here in Vermont, however, don’t have a Republican congressperson to defeat. So the only effective way we can participate in the “No Kings” movement is to financially support viable non-Republican candidates in either “blue” or “swing” states.

California and New York, the “big blues,” could achieve the upset goal, but their well-known vulnerable congressional elections will be hard fought, and there are a few vulnerable Democratic congresspersons who could lose. 
Another option is to financially support strong candidates in competitive “swing state” races. Arizona, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have a number of potential “pick-up” seats that are well worth considering.
The House of Representatives controls the budget, has oversight of and can conduct investigations into government activities and initiates impeachment.
Eliminating Republican control in the House would really hobble Trump’s agenda and make him a lame duck president for the last two years of his term. It would also send a message to wavering Republican Senators running for re-election in 2028.

In their June 13 commentary, “The Achilles’ heel of Vermont education reform,” the Friends of Vermont Public Education state that, “Since the early 1990s, we have been operating two parallel educational systems — public and private.” The organization calls upon the Vermont Legislature to create “one unified educational system,” arguing that, “The current structure allows independent schools to operate with significantly less oversight and accountability compared to public schools.” 
These are curious assertions. St. Johnsbury Academy was founded in 1842, Burr and Burton in 1829, Lyndon Institute in 1867 and Thetford Academy in 1819. Putney School opened in 1935 and Vermont Academy in 1876.
Many independent schools in our state predate every public school, and their missions, educational standards and civically engaged graduates have played essential roles in every conceivable arena of Vermont life.
In their literary metaphor, the Friends of Vermont Public Education portray independent schools as significantly weakening the educational landscape because they lack “stringent transparency” and are “exempt from public meetings, financial information disclosure, budget voter approval and public records accessibility.”

First, both public and independent schools in Vermont are accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. The standards are, in fact, applied and enforced equally in all accredited schools.
In Vermont, 23 public schools and 45 independent schools are NEASC accredited, with 12 public school candidates and 1 independent school candidate for accreditation. The Vermont Agency of Education and NEASC have worked together effectively and cooperatively for many years.
Second, every nonprofit/non-religious independent school reports its finances annually through the IRS Form 990. These annual reports are readily available through Guidestar and other online resources. There is nothing hidden or obscure about the income and expenditures of these institutions.
Third, independent schools state their missions publicly and clearly articulate what they expect from themselves and from their students. Few institutions, public or independent, can be “all things to all people.” Independent schools are required to be honest with the public about what they can — and cannot — accomplish with their kids. 
Finally, independent schools are held to their publicly stated missions and practices by the most stringent standard possible. If they do not achieve their educational goals they will close. Attendance at these schools is voluntary and students and families who find their expectations disappointed will withdraw. Independent schools must answer for their aspirations with their actual achievements. And with their existence.
The question of whether or not students and their families can use taxpayer funds to attend independent schools presents complex issues.
Given the obvious differences among citizens in a democracy, it is fair to ask if families have the right to choose schools that meet their needs or their philosophies. Given the limited public resources available, it is fair to question if using some of this money to fund families’ choices detracts from the rights of other students. Given the realities of Vermont’s geography, our historic town autonomy and the long and successful history of independent schools, it is fair to ask if a “universal” education system is a practical possibility and a philosophical necessity.
Many independent schools in Vermont have operated for more than a century. Their standards both on paper and in their living graduates could not be a more public declaration of their capacity to educate effectively. 
The answer to a complex question is sometimes complex. Both independent and public schools can meet the aspirations we all have for our kids. A system that seeks ways to work cooperatively rather than antagonistically makes the most sense in this state.

Mothers who’ve been deported with infants while their older kids are left behind in the U.S.
These are among the situations the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network is hearing about these days, according to Executive Director Catalina Velasquez. The immigrant rights group’s hotline is receiving a steady stream of calls.
“Nobody wants to have to think about making a plan for who will become a guardian to their children if they are deported, but it is, unfortunately, a grim reality that immigrant communities have to face,” Velasquez said in a statement. 
“Our communities also have to navigate multiple complex systems and bureaucracies in order to make safety plans,” she continued.
A new Washington state task force aims to assess those systems. It was created a week after President Donald Trump reclaimed office and embarked upon a campaign of mass deportation.
In its first report, issued publicly this month, the task force found Washington faces multiple gaps in supports for separated immigrant families.
Since Gov. Bob Ferguson established the Family Separation Response Task Force in January, the federal government has taken increasingly brazen steps to detain immigrants, including U.S. citizens, to meet the White House’s goals. 
“My administration will do everything we can possibly do to address those significant harms that are caused by those policies,” the Democratic governor said as he created the task force. “That’s making sure that kids who are torn away and separated from their parents have someone to care for them, and they have uninterrupted access to their education.”
The state similarly worked to improve its policies in this area during the first Trump administration.
The task force, housed in the state Department of Children, Youth and Families, includes representatives from about two dozen state agencies and partners with groups like Velasquez’s.
For years, Washington law has barred local police from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. The state has created guidance on how school officials should comply with this. 
For example, schools can’t reach out to immigration agents to share information about students. And schools are required to implement policy on what to do if deportation authorities show up on campus.




How to prepare
Advocates recommend families plan for the possibility that federal authorities could detain them. 
Important steps include figuring out who will watch children if parents are detained or deported, ensuring the children have passports, and writing down any important medical information.
Resources and answers to frequently asked questions can be found at dcyf.wa.gov/EOTaskForce. 			





	But the task force found such training is missing for extra-curricular activities, like parents supervising field trips and sporting events off campus. So the panel is working with the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction to develop such guidance.
The report also flagged a gap in cases when authorities detain one parent but not another. It is difficult for the remaining parent to receive sole guardianship of their child without evidence of abuse or neglect.
To find these missing pieces, the task force ran through a few scenarios. What would happen if a family is packing up groceries in a store parking lot and both parents are detained? Or if immigration officials raid a neighborhood and multiple children are left without any relatives to take care of them? Or if a raid at their workplace leaves children stuck in child care?
The Department of Children, Youth and Families only gets involved if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can’t find anyone to care for the children. Usually, parents identify a relative or neighbor to watch them. 
It is “very rare” for a child separated from their deported parents to enter foster care, said DCYF spokesperson Kortney Scroger.
The task force’s final report is due in the winter.

We build safety when we link arms with our Palestinian siblings, and speak out against U.S. military support for Israel.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Joanna Colwell: 2 Jews, 3 opinions.","This commentary is by Joanna Colwell of Ripton. She is a member of L’Chaim Collective, a spiritual home for justice-seeking Jewish Vermonters. She helped found the Middlebury chapter of Showing Up for Racial Justice, and is a member of Jewish Voice for Peace of Vermont/New Hampshire.


The saying “Two Jews, three opinions” seems especially true right now. Our people have a centuries long tradition of contentious intellectual debates, and arguing is our Olympic sport.
So it should surprise none of us that on the subject of Israel, there is very little unity among Jewish Americans. 
I am part of L’Chaim Collective, a group of Vermont Jews who are committed to celebrating Jewish culture outside of nationalism. We gather to mark Jewish holy days, to learn, grieve, sing and eat together, and to provide a refuge for the many Vermont Jews who feel completely alienated from organizations that support what the state of Israel is doing to the Palestinian people.
Even before Israel was founded, great numbers of Jewish people sought to create safety for Jews in ways other than creating a nation-state. Across many European countries, thousands of people joined the Bund, a Jewish-led labor and social justice movement.
Bund members believed in fighting antisemitism by building solidarity among all oppressed people. Instead of seeking to form a separate Jewish nation, the Bund built alliances and fought the hatred of Jews head-on, with education and community building.
Today many Vermont Jews hold these same values. We march behind these banners: “Safety Through Solidarity,” “Jews Against Fascism” and “ICE = Gestapo — Jews Say No!” We know we are not safe unless our undocumented siblings are also safe. We are not safe until our trans siblings are safe. And we are not safe while Palestine is under occupation and siege. The fight against fascism runs straight through Palestine.
While mainstream Jewish organizations like the ADL wish to conflate criticism of Israel with antisemitism, we hold the opposite view. We actually think Jews are less safe, if the world thinks we wholeheartedly support the destruction of Gaza.
Personally, I have been in the streets against Israel’s brutality since before October 7th, because I believe in universal human rights, and safety and dignity for all people. Genocide is always wrong, no matter who is committing the atrocities. 
We build safety when we link arms with our Palestinian siblings, and speak out against U.S. military support for Israel. We build solidarity when we show up with our friends at Migrant Justice to protest mass deportations.We build justice when we join Free Her to say Vermont should absolutely not be building prisons and detention centers! 
Jewish people deserve safety and joy wherever we live. Palestinians deserve that too.  Our safety as Jews and the safety of Palestinians are inextricably linked, braided together like the strands in a loaf of challah.

It’s sad to say this isn’t an aberration.
On the federal level, we saw then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords shot during a constituent meeting in 2011. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband was attacked in his home in 2022. A man plotted to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that same year.
And it’s not just those with high profiles in Washington D.C. Indiana’s public servants have seen its own fair share of concerning behavior.
U.S. Sen. Jim Banks was threatened by a constituent when he was in the U.S. House. In his messages, the man said he owned a gun as allowed by the Constitution and told Banks to choose between himself or his daughters, according to the June 2 probable cause filing.
“Here’s the choice. Your daughters grow up without their dad or you grow old without your daughters,” Thompson allegedly said. “… boom, boom, you pick …”
He received probation.

State Rep. Chris Judy sought and received a protective order in 2017 after a constituent contacted him more than 50 times in one day, asked for his home address and sent a letter to his wife.
State Rep. Ed Delaney, D-Indianapolis, was attacked in 2016, though it was unrelated to his legislative service. He suffered five broken bones and a broken eye socket.
Indiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush in 2024 asked lawmakers for new money to help improve security in courthouses throughout the state. She told lawmakers there was an unprecedented level of threats against judicial officers, noting a survey found about 75% of Indiana judges surveyed reported being threatened.
And this is a woman who knows about threats. In 1998, a man broke into her home and attacked her husband. She had just been elected a juvenile judge and had to escape through a second-floor window to call police.
Luckily, no one died in any of those.
But on Sunday, Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, did.
The question everyone is asking now is how to stop this political violence. I wish I had the answer. I think the mental health system is overtaxed and underfunded, and people have forgotten how to deal constructively with their frustration.
A number of states are removing addresses of lawmakers from official websites, which might help in some situations but only targets the symptoms and not the cause. As a journalist, I am torn on this because there are legitimate reasons to know an elected official’s address.
Here are some examples that I have personally used them for:

Seeing who was drawn into or out of districts during redistricting
Tying donations to causes or groups
Matching criminal cases or infractions to public servants
Connecting lawmakers to corporations or partnerships to identify conflicts of interest

I would hate for that work to be lost. A middle ground might be making reporters physically trek to a Statehouse or courthouse to find the data. So, it would still be available but would add some inconvenience.
Honestly, I can generally find an address for people with a quick online search. So I think, in a way, it’s trying to put the genie back in the bottle. There just isn’t a way to stop someone intent on harming another person.
I think many of these perpetrators just feel lost and unheard by their government. They are lost in a sea of voices and many of those serving refuse to interact with constituents. Perhaps because of these exact situations.
It’s a no-win situation for everyone involved.

Story summary

On May 23, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued an emergency order demanding that the J.H. Campbell plant “remain available for operation” — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.
On Wednesday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a request for rehearing with the DOE, challenging what she described as an “arbitrary and illegal order.”
Energy experts say the cost to keep the plant open beyond its planned closure date could pass along millions in costs to taxpayers.


LANSING — Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has challenged the U.S. Department of Energy’s forcing the Consumers Energy-owned J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon to remain open for 90 days, arguing that the move will force customers to absorb exorbitant costs.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the emergency order demanding that the plant “remain available for operation” on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.
The U.S. Department of Energy said the move is intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”
On Wednesday, Nessel filed a request for rehearing with the DOE, challenging what she described as an “arbitrary and illegal order seeking to stop the planned retirement of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”
She said the order “will burden Michigan utility customers with unnecessary costs and needless additional pollution from the 60-year-old Ottawa County coal plant that was scheduled to close May 31.”
A request for rehearing is a legal process where a party asks a court to reconsider a decision it has already made. It’s typically used when a party believes the court made a mistake in its initial ruling, whether by overlooking a crucial fact, misinterpreting the law, or making some other error.

 How we got here


The Campbell Plant is Consumers’ last — and largest — coal-fired plant in the state.
The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.
The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.
Since the announcement, Consumers has been actively preparing the plant for “full retirement,” a spokesperson said last year.
“The complex will officially go into retirement with an aim to go cold and dark after 2025,” said former Consumers spokesperson Kristen Van Kley. “In 2026 and on, the complex will be demolished with a plan to restore the site over time.”
The plant, when operating at full capacity, can generate 1,450 megawatts of electricity. Michigan consumed about 113,740 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2019, according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Department of Energy.
At the time, Van Kley said new technologies would ensure Consumers would be able to continue supporting the statewide grid.
“Energy efficiency, demand response and emerging technologies such as grid modernization and battery storage will help us lower peak customer demand for electricity and deliver exactly what Michigan needs,” she said. “Our plan is designed to respond to emerging needs, adapt to changing conditions and embrace emerging innovative technologies as we work to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.”
The emergency order came after a yearlong effort from a local grassroots organization petitioned Ottawa County officials to intervene in some way to prevent the closure of the Campbell plant.
Organizers of the “Save the Campbell” effort coalesced at the beginning of 2024 — mainly members of far-right fundamentalist groups such as Ottawa Impact, The Gideon 300 and the Ottawa County GOP — said a government-owned electric co-op was possible if voters approved a “home rule charter” at the ballot box.
The issue was never put up for a vote, so a change in government structure is not forthcoming; however, local officials asked Consumers for reassurance earlier this year that local energy supplies will be uninterrupted as the Campbell plant headed for closure at the end of May.
In February, the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution urging delay in the plant’s closure, however, officials stopped short April 22 of opting to bring litigation to prevent the closure altogether.

Commissioners pointed to two separate reports — from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC — that gave them concerns over the energy grid’s reliability once the Campbell is taken offline.
MISO published the results of its annual survey in June 2024, which indicated at the time that there was “a growing capacity deficit beginning in the 2025-26 planning year.”
“Next summer, MISO could see resource sufficiency ranging from a 2.7 GW capacity shortfall to a 1.1 GW surplus, underscoring the need to accelerate resource additions, monitor large load additions, and delay resource retirements to reliably manage the anticipated growth in electricity demand,” according to the survey.
NERC is a nonprofit international regulatory authority that more broadly looks at reliability standards as well as seasonal and long‐term outlooks for the entire U.S. grid. The group published a long-term reliability assessment in December 2024 that labeled MISO’s section of the grid as “high risk,” meaning the grid subsection that includes the state of Michigan “falls below established resource adequacy criteria in the next five years.”
“High-risk areas are likely to experience a shortfall in electricity supplies at the peak of an average summer or winter season. Extreme weather, producing wide-area heat waves or deep-freeze events, poses an even greater threat to reliability,” the report said.
  NERC, which broadly looks at seasonal and long‐term outlooks for the entire U.S. energy grid, published a long-term reliability assessment in December 2024 that labeled the section that includes Michigan as “high risk.” [Screenshot]Commissioner Jacob Bonnema questioned why Consumers opted to sunset the plant five years ahead than previously planned.Dena Isabell, stakeholder engagement manager at Consumers, told commissioners in February that Consumers adopted in 2021 that helped the company identify about $600 million in savings for its customers over 20 years with the retirement of the plant.“That includes renewables that get brought onto the grid, which are cheaper than what we have,” she said, “so that is a savings to our customers, which is part of the clean and affordable and reliable energy — so it’s an economic decision.”One component of the cost savings was coal.
Rich Houtteman, community affairs manager for Consumers, explained to commissioners in February that the cost of shipping coal is a huge financial consideration for the energy company.
“It’s about $50 a ton to ship excess coal off-site,” he said. “We had 30,000 tons. That’s a lot for our customers. So we’re trying to burn up all the coal as we kind of bring in 130 train carloads a day.”
 Last-minute intervention

On May 23, Secretary Wright directed MISO, in coordination with Consumers, to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”
“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Wright said in a prepared news release.
The Energy Department said the emergency order, which is issued by the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”
“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives regardless of whether the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining.”
The topic became a political talking point this year with Ottawa Impact commissioners. When the far-right group held a controlling majority on the board in 2023 and 2024, they largely avoided the subject, but since transitioning to a four-seat minority on the 11-member board in January, the topic has come up frequently.
OI Commissioner Allison Miedema strongly backed the county suing Consumers to prevent the Campbell closure; however, the measure lost in a 7-4 vote at the board’s April 22 meeting.
OI Commissioner Sylvia Rhodea said at the board’s May 27 meeting that Wright’s order provided a “90-day reprieve” of the delayed closure of the Campbell plant.
“Man, we dodged a bullet with that one,” she said.

	Nessel said Wright’s order would lead to Michiganders “feeling a pinch in their pockets.”“The costs of maintaining production at the plant, long since prepared for closure, could be an enormous burden on the rate-paying customers of Consumers Energy,” she said. “And that’s before taking into account the environmental and public health costs of continuing to fuel a coal-powered plant.”In a June 3 statement, a Consumers spokesperson said the company is currently complying with the order.
“We are currently in compliance with the order, have arranged for new shipments of coal, some of which arrived last week, and will continuously operate the Campbell Plant,” Trisha Bloembergen, West Michigan media relations specialist, said in a June 3 email. “We are still determining the overall cost, but want to ensure those costs are shared across MISO and not all on Consumers Energy customers.”
Generating power at the Campbell plant is likely to be costly for ratepayers, experts from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote June 5.
  In 2024, Campbell burned more than 3.7 million tons of coal. [Courtesy]Campbell Units 1 and 2, which are 63 and 58 years old, respectively, were already increasingly uncompetitive in the MISO market, meaning it cost more to generate electricity than what it could be sold for, said energy data analysts Seth Feaster and Dennis Wamsted.According to data filed by Consumers at FERC, the operation and maintenance costs for the two units totaled $45.80 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2023 (the most recent data available). That puts both units in the red almost all the time in MISO: S&P data shows that the monthly around-the-clock price at the Michigan hub has been above $40/MWh just twice in the past two years, and never during the summer.”In other words, the plant would lose money on virtually every MWh generated if past prices hold this summer, costs that could add up to many more millions of dollars if the units at Campbell are run for any substantial amount of time,” Feaster and Wamsted said.Beyond operational costs, there are fuel and staffing costs as well.
“Coal itself has gotten more expensive,” said Frank Rambo, executive director at Horizon Climate Initiative, a nonprofit organization that works to use cost-saving energy market reforms to address the causes and impacts of climate change.
“That fleet has gotten more expensive to run. It’s coal, which used to be synonymous with cheap power. It’s now among the most expensive power … and then the excess costs that are incurred because they’re running more expensive resources.
Ultimately, it will be residents who foot the bill, Rambo said.
“They run those coal plants, and then they turn around, go to their commissions and recover those excess costs from their customers,” he said.
Rambo said the price could be even higher than normal because Consumers would need to buy coal on the open market rather than enter into a new contract with a mine.
“We don’t need to sign a new long-term coal supply contract because we’re shutting the plant down,” he said. “Now they may have to buy coal on the spot market.”
The price of coal has hovered around $110 per ton on the U.S. commodities exchange. As of June 19, the price of coal was $103.85 per ton.
In 2024, Campbell burned more than 3.7 million tons of coal, Feaster and Wamsted said. That is an average of 12,700 tons of coal a day, which would amount to $1,318,895 per day using today’s prices.
All of the Campbell plant’s coal previously was delivered by rail from the Powder River Basin in northern Wyoming, according to the IEFF.
Two of the PRB’s biggest mines provided that coal: Arch Resources’ Black Thunder Mine, which delivered 2.25 million tons, and Peabody Energy’s North Antelope Rochelle Mine, which delivered 1.47 million tons.
Rambo also noted the plant staffing issue, explaining that Consumers likely already had phased out several employees who were then called back.
“We were laying these people off. Now we’re going to have to hire them as contractors,” likely at a higher pay rate because the work would be temporary, Rambo explained.
“There are all sorts of excess costs that would not be incurred, but for the fact that there’s now this executive order,” he said.
 What happens next?

Feaster and Wamsted said Consumers has brought online 502MW of wind generation since 2020, bought the 1,055MW Covert combined cycle gas plant in 2023, and is in the process of adding 515MW of solar generation to its system by 2027.
They said this indicates that the DOE intervention wasn’t necessary.
“These capacity-replacement moves were clearly enough for MISO. The system operator’s endorsement is critical, since it has the authority to require plants to continue operating if it believes grid stability or shortages could occur,” the analysts wrote.
They pointed to MISO requiring Missouri-based Ameren to keep its 1,195MW Rush Island coal plant open in 2022 for reliability reasons. The decision was upheld by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the plant remained open until 2024.
“MISO found no similar problems with Consumers’ plan to close the Campbell plant, saying as recently as May 8 that the region has sufficient resources to meet projected demand this summer,” Feaster and Wamsted said. “Despite this, the Department of Energy said in its May 24 emergency order that it was directing MISO and Consumers to keep the plant open due to an expected ‘insufficiency of dispatchable capacity’ during the summer.”
Rambo said he’s concerned that this could indicate more federal intervention in the energy sector, which could drive up costs for all.
“This very well could be a bellwether of more things to come. And that’s why I’m concerned about this as an example. Because if this does turn out to be the first of many, we should all be prepared for higher energy bills,” he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-24-065259.png,,,2025-06-20 07:02:10.627988

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A “rare” presidential artifact long held in private hands is now on public view in Indiana — at least for the summer.
The original, signed reading copy of President Benjamin Harrison’s 1889 inaugural address — the same manuscript he held while delivering his speech at the U.S. Capitol — is on display at his presidential site in Indianapolis, but the document remains up for sale.
The piece is on loan from The Raab Collection, a Philadelphia-based firm that specializes in historical documents. It stayed in the Harrison family for generations before the firm acquired it 15 years ago. Previously sold on the private market, the address is now up for grabs publicly for the first time.
The Raab Collection is asking $225,000 for the artifact but has stopped “actively marketing” the manuscript and put potential sales “on hold” while it’s on display, a spokesperson told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. Once returned to the collection in September, it will again be for sale.










The hard part isn't selling it. The hard part is finding it. And we’re showing the world the history that we’re finding.


– Nathan Raab, president of The Raab Collection


The document, complete with Harrison’s handwritten edits, is one of the few known inaugural address manuscripts still in private hands — and one of even fewer to be personally signed and used during delivery.
The reading copy is now the centerpiece of the “Treasures of the Harrison Collection” exhibit, on display through Aug. 30. It’s being shown alongside an annotated version of the same speech that belongs to the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site’s permanent collection.
“We all love Harrison — he had the original dynastic family. … And this inaugural address is kind of a gem for us,” said Nathan Raab, president of The Raab Collection, during a visit to Harrison’s presidential home this week. “The hard part isn’t selling it. The hard part is finding it. And we’re showing the world the history that we’re finding.”

The Raab Collection specializes in rare, “historically significant” documents from the likes of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and other notable figures. Its inventory includes presidential letters, signed speeches and personal correspondence — many of which have been acquired by major museums, libraries, universities, and archives across the country, Raab said.
He emphasized that many of the collection’s rarest historical items come from attics, family storage boxes, and sometimes people “unsure of what they’re holding.”
“We are their first call,” he said. “These are people who have this thing that they know has some value, and they don’t know who to leave it to.”

“Their kids don’t have any interest and they sense that it will be lost or forgotten if they don’t do something with it,” he continued. “And at that point, the money is more valuable to them than the thing.”
The Harrison inaugural address came to the firm from a descendant of the president — “a man whose name is still Harrison,” Raab said — who had inherited a “huge family archive.” The Raab Collection purchased the speech, along with other personal artifacts and letters.
Several Harrison-related pieces currently available from The Raab Collection include correspondence between the president and his family, a report sent to Congress, and his order admitting the state of Washington. They range in price from $2,500 to $50,000.
Although not on the market, Raab said the firm additionally purchased unique items connected to Harrison grandfather, President William Henry Harrison, like a signed lottery ticket and a Congressional Gold Medal given to for his service in the War of 1812.
On view through August
Harrison, among Indiana’s most famous residents, and the only president to have hailed directly from the Hoosier state, was a Civil War general and lawyer who descended from an already political family.
He was the great-grandson of Declaration of Independence signer Benjamin Harrison, the grandson of President William Henry Harrison, and son of Congressman John Scott Harrison.
Harrison added to that legacy, first serving as a U.S. senator, and then as president when he narrowly defeated the incumbent Grover Cleveland in the election of 1888.

He accepted the country’s highest office on March 4, 1889.
Harrison’s inaugural address was well-received and is still considered by historians to be among the best
The manuscript Harrison pulled from his pocket is the same one for sale. The Raab Collection said it numbers 37 single-sided pages on watermarked paper. 
Considering Harrison’s known practice was to annotate documents immediately after events, Raab said it’s assumed that the former president signed and added this note right after the address: “This is the MSS [manuscript] used by me in delivering the address March 4, 1889.”
Harrison had the sheets bound in a small book, which was handed down from generation to generation in the Harrison family. 
Raab did not disclose how much the manuscript was previously bought or sold for.
He said the collection’s research has failed to turn up “even one” other delivered manuscript, a “reading copy,” of an inaugural address having reached the market.
Separately, however, the Harrison presidential site in Indianapolis has long retained in its archive an annotated version of the same speech. That piece continues to be on display in one of the museum’s exhibits.
The Library of Congress additionally holds three drafts of Harrison’s inaugural address.

(Getty Images)President Donald Trump during his first administration promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, but fell short.
While there’s less chatter about the repeal, during Trump’s second administration the One Big Beautiful Bill Act might deliver on the years-old promise.
Although cuts to the Medicaid and supplemental nutrition assistance programs (SNAP) are grabbing the headlines, Florida health care advocates worry that the changes to the ACA may be even more damaging.
Florida leads the nation in Obamacare enrollment in 2025, with 4.7 million people enrolled in the marketplace, U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data show. A key feature of the ACA is the marketplace through which people can use advanced premium tax credits to purchase subsidized health insurance. 
By contrast, there are 4.17 million people enrolled in Medicaid in Florida, the safety net program for the poor, elderly, and disabled.
During COVID, Congress agreed to make the premium tax credits more generous than those in the original law. The enhanced credits allow people who earn more money to qualify for the subsidies. Under the U.S. House version of the budget reconciliation act, these enhanced advance tax credits are slated to expire at the end of the year, although the original credits contained in the ACA will remain intact.
Advocates warn it’s not just the elimination of the enhanced advanced premium tax credits that will hurt people.
The House reconciliation bill also shortens the Obamacare open-enrollment periods, eliminates special enrollment periods for low-income individuals, and requires people to show upfront significant documents such as passports, birth certificates, marriage certificates, and income tax records to  qualify for the advanced premiums tax credits.
 Florida Health Justice legal director Lynn Hearn said the changes will blunt the progess the ACA has shown in providing people access to affordable health insurance.

“This time, Congress might not be calling it an outright repeal of the ACA, as it did in 2017, but a program that is inaccessible or unaffordable is as good as repeal,” Hearn said during a panel discussion on the ACA, Medicaid, and SNAP cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Send a letter
The Florida Health Justice Project and 76 other entities across the state sent a letter Tuesday to Florida Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody expressing concerns with the ACA changes as well as the proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. 
“Floridians in every county across the state will experience a devastating loss of essential health care coverage and food assistance if Congress follows through with the current proposal,” the letter reads. “In Florida, over 4 million people are enrolled in Medicaid, most of whom are children, older adults, or people with disabilities.”
The letter was sent as the Kaiser Family Foundation released a poll that showed the budget reconciliation bill is viewed unfavorably by large majorities of Democrats (85%) and independents (71%), but favorably by six in 10 Republicans (61%).
A breakdown of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who self-identify as supporters of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement (72%) view the bill favorably. By contrast, 66% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who don’t identify with the MAGA movement view the bill unfavorably.
The Florida Policy Institute coordinated a press conference with Florida Health Justice and others to highlight the letter and discuss the cuts more in depth. FPI is dedicated to advancing policies and budgets that improve the economic mobility and quality of life for all Floridians.
President of the SEIU Florida State Council Martha Baker has been a registered nurse for more than 45 years and spent the last 35 years working at Jackson Health System in Miami. The system, she said, should be a role model for the nation.
“Jackson’s mission has been since the beginning of time for one single high standard of care to all residents regardless of your ability to pay. Dade County citizens have endorsed that with tax donations for the last 100 years. And again, this is an example of how healthcare should be delivered in the richest country on Earth.”
Limiting access to the marketplace health insurance policies and cutting Medicaid “is only going to be penny wise and dollar foolish, as they say,” she said.

Details on the taxes
Since its inception, the ACA has included advanced premium tax credits to help offset the costs of the policies for people with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, which in 2025 was $126,800 for a family of four. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, Congress increased the subsidies and included a provision that allowed people who earn more than 400% of the poverty level to qualify for them. Congress the following year extended the enhanced tax credits through 2025.
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services March data show that of the 4.7 million Florida residents with an Obamacare plan in 2025, 4.6 million receive advanced premium tax credits.
Because of those credits, 2.3 million enrollees pay less than $10 a month for their health insurance. On average, the CMS data show, the monthly Obamacare premium in Florida is $67.
Only Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas (all of which have lower Obamacare enrollment) have lower average monthly premiums.
Hearn said that allowing the enhanced advanced premium tax credits to expire could lead to a 75% increase in health insurance costs for ACA enrollees in families who earn more than 400% of the poverty level. That means a family of four earning more than $126,000 could wind up with a $9,000 a year premium increase, Hearn said.
“So obviously, this is going to make it unaffordable for many people,” Hearn said.
And those rates could increase even more, she said, if paperwork requirements for annual open enrollment aren’t removed.
The paperwork requirement is more than inconvenient, Hearn said, noting that they could have a deleterious effect on premiums. She worries that healthy people, who may not rely  on health insurance on a daily basis, will find the requirements burdensome and won’t enroll.
But people with medically complex conditions who routinely tap into their health insurance benefits will take pains to ensure they comply.
If healthy people leave and sick people who have higher-than-average healthcare costs remain, premiums will increase and the market becomes less stable.
“So, it’s a race to the bottom,” Hearn said.
And that, she contends, will hurt small businesses — the same companies the Legislature said it wanted to help by permanently eliminating the business rent tax in the recently passed tax relief plan.
“In Florida, many of the enrollees tend to be small-business owners and employees and their families. Businesses where the employer isn’t obligated to offer health insurance because of its size, or it does offer health insurance but it’s unaffordable for either the employee themselves or their extended family,” Hearn said.

(Photo by Jariel Arvin for KFF Health News)On Fridays, Stephanie Johnson has a busy schedule, driving her navy-blue Jeep from one patient’s home to the next, seeing eight in all. Pregnant with her second child, she schleps a backpack instead of a traditional black bag to carry a laptop and essential medical supplies — stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, and pulse oximeter.
Forget a lunch break; she often eats a sandwich or some nuts as she heads to her next patient visit.
On a gloomy Friday in January, Johnson, a nurse practitioner who treats older adults, had a hospice consult with Ellen, a patient in her 90s in declining health. To protect Ellen’s identity, KFF Health News is not using her last name.
“Hello. How are you feeling?” Johnson asked as she entered Ellen’s bedroom and inquired about her pain. The blinds were drawn. Ellen was in a wheelchair, wearing a white sweater, gray sweatpants, and fuzzy socks. A headband was tied around her white hair. As usual, the TV was playing loudly in the background.
“It’s fine, except this cough I’ve had since junior high,” Ellen said.
Ellen had been diagnosed with vascular dementia, peripheral vascular disease, and Type 2 diabetes. Last fall, doctors made the difficult decision to operate on her foot. Before the surgery, Ellen was always colorful, wearing purple, yellow, blue, pink, and chunky necklaces. She enjoyed talking with the half dozen other residents at her adult family home in Washington state. She had a hearty appetite that brought her to the breakfast table early. But lately, her enthusiasm for meals and socializing had waned.
Johnson got down to eye level with Ellen to examine her, assessing her joints and range of motion, checking her blood pressure, and listening to her heart and lungs.
Carefully, Johnson removed the bandage to examine Ellen’s toes. Her lower legs were red but cold to the touch, which indicated her condition wasn’t improving. Ellen’s two younger sisters had power of attorney for her and made it clear that, above all, they wanted her to be comfortable. Now, Johnson thought it was time to have that difficult conversation with them about Ellen’s prognosis, recommending her for hospice.
“Our patient isn’t just the older adult,” Johnson said. “It’s also often the family member or the person helping to manage them.”
Nurse practitioners are having those conversations more and more as their patient base trends older. They are increasingly filling a gap that is expected to widen as the senior population explodes and the number of geriatricians declines. The Health Resources and Services Administration projects a 50% increase in demand for geriatricians from 2018 to 2030, when the entire baby boom generation will be older than 65. By then, hundreds of geriatricians are expected to retire or leave the specialty, reducing their number to fewer than 7,600, with relatively few young doctors joining the field.
That means many older adults will be relying on other primary care physicians, who already can’t keep up with demand, and nurse practitioners, whose ranks are booming. The number of nurse practitioners specializing in geriatrics has more than tripled since 2010, increasing the availability of care to the current population of seniors, a recent study in JAMA Network Open found.
According to a 2024 survey, of the roughly 431,000 licensed nurse practitioners, 15% are, like Johnson, certified to treat older adults.
Johnson and her husband, Dustin, operate an NP-led private practice in greater Seattle, Washington, a state where she can practice independently. She and her team, which includes five additional nurse practitioners, each try to see about 10 patients a day, visiting each one every five to six weeks. Visits typically last 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the case.
“There are so many housebound older adults, and we’re barely reaching them,” Johnson said. “For those still in their private homes, there’s such a huge need.”
Laura Wagner, a professor of nursing and community health systems at the University of California-San Francisco, stressed that nurse practitioners are not trying to replace doctors; they’re trying to meet patients’ needs, wherever they may be.
“One of the things I’m most proud of is the role of nurse practitioners,” she said. “We step into places where other providers may not, and geriatrics is a prime example of that.”
Practice limits
Nurse practitioners are registered nurses with advanced training that enables them to diagnose diseases, analyze diagnostic tests, and prescribe medicine. Their growth has bolstered primary care, and, like doctors, they can specialize in particular branches of medicine. Johnson, for example, has advanced training in gerontology.
“If we have a geriatrician shortage, then hiring more nurse practitioners trained in geriatrics is an ideal solution,” Wagner said, “but there are a lot of barriers in place.”
In 27 states and Washington, D.C., nurse practitioners can practice independently. But in the rest of the country, they need to have a collaborative agreement with or be under the supervision of another health care provider to provide care to older adults. Medicare generally reimburses for nurse practitioner services at 85% of the amount it pays physicians.
Last year, in more than 40 states, the American Medical Association and its partners lobbied against what they see as “scope creep” in the expanded roles of nurse practitioners and other health workers. The AMA points out that doctors must have more schooling and significantly more clinical experience than nurse practitioners. While the AMA says physician-led teams keep costs lower, a study published in 2020 in Health Services Research found similar patient outcomes and lower costs for nurse practitioner patients. Other studies, including one published in 2023 in the journal Medical Care Research and Review, have found health care models including nurse practitioners had better outcomes for patients with multiple chronic conditions than teams without an NP.
Five states have granted NPs full practice authority since 2021, with Utah the most recent state to remove physician supervision requirements, in 2023. In March, however, Mississippi House Bill 849, which would have increased NP independence, failed. Meanwhile, 30 Texas physicians rallied to tamp down full-scope efforts in Austin.
“I would fully disagree that we’re invading their scope of practice and shouldn’t have full scope of our own,” Johnson said.
She has worked under the supervision of physicians in Pennsylvania and Washington state but started seeing patients at her own practice in 2021. Like many nurse practitioners, she sees her patients in their homes. The first thing she does when she gets a new patient is manage their prescriptions, getting rid of unnecessary medications, especially those with harsh side effects.
She works with the patient and a family member who often has power of attorney. She keeps them informed of subtle changes, such as whether a person was verbal and eating and whether their medical conditions have changed.
While there is some overlap in expertise between geriatricians and nurse practitioners, there are areas where nurses typically excel, said Elizabeth White, an assistant professor of health services, policy, and practice at Brown University.
“We tend to be a little stronger in care coordination, family and patient education, and integrating care and social and medical needs. That’s very much in the nursing domain,” she said.
That care coordination will become even more critical as the U.S. ages. Today, about 18% of the U.S. population is 65 or over. In the next 30 years, the share of seniors is expected to reach 23%, as medical and technological advances enable people to live longer.
Patient and family
In an office next to Ellen’s bedroom, Johnson called Ellen’s younger sister Margaret Watt to recommend that Ellen enter hospice care. Johnson told her that Ellen had developed pneumonia and her body wasn’t coping.
Watt appreciated that Johnson had kept the family apprised of Ellen’s condition for several years, saying she was a good communicator.
“She was accurate,” Watt said. “What she said would happen, happened.”
A month after the consult, Ellen died peacefully in her sleep.
“I do feel sadness,” Johnson said, “but there’s also a sense of relief that I’ve been with her through her suffering to try to alleviate it, and I’ve helped her meet her and her family’s priorities in that time.”

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota legislative leaders recently ordered the removal of lawmakers’ home addresses from the Legislature’s website in response to the shootings of two lawmakers and their spouses in Minnesota.
The decision is about personal safety, said state Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls. 
Legislative staff removed addresses, cities of residence and ZIP codes from lawmakers’ profile pages and from a downloadable list of legislators. Lawmakers’ cities of residence are still viewable on the “historical listing” section of the website, and Karr said the cities of residence could eventually be restored on the profile pages.
With so many other modern methods of communication, Karr said he doesn’t see a reason why a constituent needs home addresses of legislators. He views that removal as permanent.

“Access is important to us, and I believe in our citizen legislature,” Karr said, “but I think there are plenty of points of access that are easier than knocking on my door and scaring my family just in the hope that I’m here.”
Other state legislatures have taken similar actions since the shootings. North Dakota, Idaho and Maine are among the states that have removed lawmaker addresses from their legislative websites. Colorado temporarily took down its public campaign finance database after dozens of elected officials requested their information be removed.
Some states, including Georgia and Louisiana, passed laws in recent years preventing their secretary of state from publishing residential addresses of people involved in political campaigns. Oregon lawmakers passed a bill the day before the Minnesota shootings to conceal addresses of elected officials and candidates.
South Dakotans can reach lawmakers by calling their Capitol phone number, by emailing their legislative address, by sending them mail at the Capitol address, or by personal phone for those that include their number on their profile page. About one-third of lawmakers don’t list a personal phone number.
Karr said he has had angry constituents visit his home. Other lawmakers have had constituents approach their families or children, sometimes with verbal attacks, he said. 
People who take the initiative to knock on a lawmaker’s door about an issue are “usually upset and not the most conducive to conversing, discoursing and solving a problem,” Karr added.
“We deal with people who get very upset and angry at us and like to blame us,” Karr said. “I think you have to be aware and cognizant of that and not naive. There are people who take it too far.”

This story was originally published by CalMatters.
Lake Tahoe’s iconic blue waters were the third murkiest on record last year and the worst they’ve been in several years, according to data from scientists who have studied the lake for decades.
Clarity of the alpine lake — measured by dropping a white disk into the water and noting when it disappears from sight — is a signal of its overall health. Tiny particles are major culprits of reduced clarity, including the sediment and other pollutants that wash into the lake from runoff and air pollution and the plankton that grow in its waters.
Researchers with UC Davis’ Tahoe Environmental Research Center reported this week that the average murkiness in 2024 was exceeded only in 2021, when fires blanketed the lake in smoke and ash, and in 2017, when the lake was clouded by sediment-laden runoff during a near-record wet year.
The report says that clarity levels are “highly variable and generally not improving,”  and recommends that “future research should focus on examining the nature of the particles that affect water clarity.”
In 2024, the white measurement disk disappeared 62.3 feet from the surface — about six feet shallower than the previous year, and only 1.9 feet deeper than the worst record set in 2017.
Last year’s average clarity was about 40 feet worse than in the late 1960s, when scientists began tracking the long decline.
Lake Tahoe, surrounded by snowy slopes in the winter and forested trails in the summer, draws 15 million visitors every year to enjoy boating, skiing and hiking — three times more than Yosemite National Park.
It’s the clearest large lake in the world, and one of the deepest. Yet despite billions in state and federal dollars spent to improve Lake Tahoe’s health, its famed clarity dropped steeply through the 1990s and, though it leveled off, has not improved. The 2024 levels fall about 16 feet short of the state’s clarity goals for 2031, and will need to improve by 35 feet to return to historical levels by 2081, according to the state’s Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board.
“I see something that we should celebrate, which is the success of management and restoration in slowing or potentially halting the decline,” Stephanie Hampton, director of the Tahoe Environmental Research Center and a professor of environmental science and policy at UC Davis, said.
Still, she added, “the water clarity is not getting noticeably worse, but it’s also not getting better. So the big question for us now is why.
The lake is clearer in winter than in summer. But last year, both winter and summer measurements were the third worst seasonal measurements on record.
The winter murkiness came a year after the lake had shown an unusually dramatic wintertime improvement — nearly 92 feet of clarity in winter of 2023, compared with about 72 feet in winter of 2022 — because of deep mixing that brought clear water to the surface.
The murkiness, however, reappeared that summer. And in 2024, summer measurements brought a mystery: Even after particle levels dropped, the lake didn’t get clearer, “suggesting unobserved factors or more complex dynamics affecting summer clarity,” the report said.
“That caught our eye, because it made us wonder, is there something that we’re not measuring that is affecting the clarity?” Hampton said. One possibility is that tiny plankton — smaller even than the ones the scientists are tracking — could be keeping the water murkier than expected.

“Tahoe is changing in several ways all at once,” Hampton said. As climate change continues, “the water is getting warmer, summer is getting longer, and that could boost some of that growth.”
Sudeep Chandra, director of the Global Water Center at the University of Nevada, Reno, said the continued decline of summer clarity means that things are more complicated than previously thought and more research is needed.
“Scientists continue to sound the alarm at Tahoe and elsewhere that we need support to not just measure the heartbeat or pulse of the lake by measuring clarity, but also the other vital organs,” said Chandra, who is not involved with the UC Davis clarity research. That includes the watershed and streams, and the lake’s ability to process nutrients and other materials that wash into it, and the effect of climate change on snowpack and drought.
Many environmental and community groups have criticized the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency — a California-Nevada governmental agency created in 1969 to protect Lake Tahoe — for allowing commercial development, tourism and growth.
For instance, the Tahoe Blue Event Center, which opened in Nevada last year, is a multi-purpose, 5,200-seat arena with an expansive luxury condominium development planned across the street.
The planning agency has “gotten off track of its core mission, which is the lake and the quality of the lake water, and the surrounding environment of the lake… They are listening to developers too much,” said Tobi Tyler, vice chair of the Sierra Club’s Tahoe Area Group. “It’s being loved to death, really.”

But officials with the Tahoe planning agency have said development projects don’t detract from their efforts to understand and restore the lake and its surroundings.
“The lake is still visible to 60 feet of clarity — it’s incredibly clear, and that’s something that we’ve managed to stop from further harm,” said Jeff Cowen, public information officer with the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.
“The clarity loss is like a locomotive where they took the steam off the engine but it’s still rolling along. And to see it stabilize is … a pretty good sign of progress.”
Cowen said roadway work has helped keep more than half a million pounds of sediment from reaching the lake. Nutrients that fuel algae growth have also been cut by thousands of pounds every year, and more than 1,400 acres of improved or restored wetlands help filter out pollutants and reduce erosion.
“It is concerning, for sure… We’re leaning on the science and the research, and it’s concerning to see that there are trends that are not reacting to the investments,” Cowen said. “We want to know what more we need to do.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/092724_DRONE-Pollution-Lake-Tahoe_MG_CM_12-1024x682.webp,,,2025-06-20 07:02:10.627988

The proposal known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — dubbed by President Donald Trump and passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in May — would reduce the maximum Pell Grant award students could receive from $7,395 to $5,710 beginning with the 2026-27 school year. It would also change the eligibility requirements by increasing the number of credit hours students must take from 12 to 15. 
The Pell Grant is a form of aid for students “who display exceptional financial need,” according to the federal student aid website. Unlike student loans, Pell Grants do not have to be repaid. 
Nationwide, nearly two out of three recipients could lose some or all of their Pell Grant funding as the House proposal now stands, according to the Center for American Progress. In Mississippi, 79,709 students received Pell Grants last year, according to a report from the National College Attainment Network. 
Key takeaways: 

A bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives would limit eligibility for the federal Pell Grant program by reducing the maximum award from $7,300 to $5,700. 
More than 79,000 Mississippi college students could see a reduction of their Pell Grant awards beginning with the 2026-27 academic school year.  
Students would no longer be eligible for the Pell Grant if they take fewer than 7.5 credit hours per semester. The change would shut out many part-time students who can only afford to take a class or two at a time. 
Changes could make college out of reach and unaffordable for many students in the state. 

Mississippi higher educational officials and advocates warn that part-time students wouldn’t be eligible for Pell Grants at all if the budget proposal passes. The proposal would also negatively impact the state’s college access goals and affordability by making it hard for students with low income to earn a degree or certificate. 
The Trump administration said reducing the maximum amount of the Pell Grant will help with the looming $2.7 billion shortfall created by past congressional decisions. Changing the eligibility definitions could save an estimated $7.1 billion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
The proposed changes aren’t final yet. The Senate did not include Pell Grant changes in its plans published last week. Both chambers will have to negotiate if any changes make it into the final budget. 
Mississippi’s community colleges would be hit hardest by the proposed changes. They enroll many part-time students, including those who work and parent while taking classes. Rural students are also more likely to enroll part time because they are limited by time and expense required to commute to college. 
Take Itawamba Community College in Fulton, a rural town in north Mississippi, for example. The college’s 428 Pell recipient students took less than 15 credit hours last fall. If the full-time requirement is increased to 15 credits a semester, the college would lose an estimated $877,047 in funding a year, a spokesperson for the state’s community college board said. 
“The reductions would also impact the institutions because many students would drop out,” Jennifer Rodgers, director of state financial aid, said. “The institutions would lose those students and the corresponding tuition revenue.” 
In Mississippi, groups like Woodward Hines Education Foundation, which helps support students through college advising, financial aid applications and scholarships, signed a letter to Congress to spare the Pell Grant program from cuts. 
The foundation is among 170 college access, business, workforce development and advocacy groups who say the proposed budget would not only increase the cost burden on students and families, but would hinder nationwide economic growth by increasing student loan borrowing and reducing opportunities for students. 
“You see some very nervous leaders in higher education right now,” Jim McHale, president and CEO of Woodward Hines, said. 
In 2024, Mississippi had the highest student loan default rate in the country, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, with 44.6% of student loan borrowers in the state more than 90 days past due on their payments. 
Colleges that serve a high number of marginalized students, such as historically Black colleges and universities, rural colleges, community colleges and tribal colleges would likely see a huge number of students dropping out. 
Earlier this year, the state post secondary education financial assistance board voted to change the definition of “full-time” for state grant eligibility from 15 to 12 credit hours per semester for the 2025-26 school year. It could make it complicated for students to also qualify for state aid to cover the gap. 
Jason Dean, executive director of Mississippi Alliance of Independent Colleges and Universities, said proposed changes will be a challenge for many low income students due to shortcomings with Mississippi’s state aid programs.  
Students who are eligible for a maximum Pell Grant cannot receive the Mississippi Resident Tuition Assistance Grant, but they may be eligible for the Mississippi Eminent Scholars Grant, which offers a few thousand a year,  if they meet the academic criteria. And while the HELP grant covers the full cost of tuition for low income students, it is also a limited program: Less than 4,000 students a year in Mississippi meet the academic requirements and come from families with a low enough income to qualify.  
The only state financial aid program that would cover the gap is the FAITH Scholarship, which is available to students who have interacted with the foster care system. The approximately 300 FAITH recipients each year would see their FAITH awards increase to cover any gaps created by the Pell changes. 
Impacted students would need to look for other scholarships from their institutions or private organizations or foundations, or they would need to take out loans or work more to cover any remaining gaps, Dean added. 
“It’s laughable,” Dean said. “It’s why we need a realignment of state policy to meet the current state’s needs and help our future students.” 
Dean said earning a certificate or degree does not just benefit the individual, but it benefits the state as well. 
In 2022, Mississippi Economic Council and Accelerate Mississippi launched “Ascent to 55%,” an initiative to ensure more than half of the state’s working-aged adults would have a certificate beyond a high school diploma by 2030. The Pell Grant proposal could severely impact college access and hinder the state’s efforts to improve its educational outcomes. 
“We’re just making it harder for students to earn a degree and find a pathway to a future,” Dean said. “It’s just unfortunate.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/06180048/MVSU12-scaled.jpg,,,2025-06-20 08:05:01.892770

By law, dispensaries are required to track how much medical marijuana patients buy so they don’t exceed their limit. 
According to a FAQ that was added earlier this year to the website of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, the state’s cannabis regulatory agency, if patients reach their limit they are not legally allowed to buy marijuana like as a recreational consumer.
“…patient ID card holders are not allowed to purchase as a consumer in a licensed dispensary,” the website states. “These regulations help ensure patients and consumers stay within their allowed possession limits.”
In general, medical patients are limited to a 6-ounce allotment of dried, unprocessed marijuana every 30 days. Recreational consumers are allowed to purchase up to 3 ounces every day — but can’t possess more than 3 ounces. 
The state is prohibited by law from tracking the purchases of people who don’t have patient ID cards without their permission. 
Andrew Mullins, executive director of the Missouri Marijuana Trade Association, sent a letter to leaders of the Division of Cannabis Regulation in April claiming the policy is unconstitutional.
“We believe that DCR’s interpretation that a Missourian must either be an adult-use consumer or a medical patient is neither good public policy nor a constitutionally sound interpretation,” he wrote.
Mullins said the policy is also inconsistent with what the division told industry members in February 2023, just days after recreational marijuana sales began in Missouri. The division sent an email responding to an industry member’s question on the issue that said patients who are 21 years of age or older “will also be able to purchase cannabis products as a consumer.”
Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the division, said the February email “was inaccurate and sent in error.” It was a few months before the final administrative rules on recreational cannabis became effective in August 2023, she said.
“The department has received and reviewed the correspondence from MoCann Trade regarding the communication that was sent in error,” Cox said. “The department has engaged directly with MoCann Trade to address their concerns and has informed them that the policies are currently under review.” 
Brennan England, Missouri state director for Minorities for Medical Marijuana, believes there needs to be a coordinated effort to repeal the policy.
 Longtime cannabis and social-justice activist Brennan England speaks at an educational event about medical marijuana, hosted at his venue, the Cola Private Lounge, in St. Louis on March 5, 2022 (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).
“We in the Black and Brown medical community were early adopters – seeking primarily legal protection, consistent access and affordability…” he said. “Restricting patient purchasing power is not a neutral act. It disrupts care, deepens mistrust, and locks out those who moved first with the most at stake.”
England, a long-time medical cannabis patient and community leader, began organizing for medical marijuana reform in 2014, leading some of the state’s largest signature drives and public education events. He founded the St. Louis Cannabis Club and opened The Cola Lounge, Missouri’s first private cannabis consumption space, in August 2019, the moment state protections for patients became active. 
England believes the rule harms minority communities disproportionately, and a repeal should be followed by a “joint policy briefing” with division leaders and impacted patients, licensed operators and legal advisors.
“Beyond policy, we need strategy that humanizes the process,” England said. “That means real conversations—not just statements—where regulators hear firsthand from patients and communities affected. A briefing is one thing, but sitting across from someone who’s had care delayed or denied by this rule? That creates impact that data alone can’t.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Andrew-Mullins-1024x785.jpg,,,2025-06-20 07:02:10.627988

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The budget process hit another roadblock as Assembly and Senate Republicans appeared to split over budget negotiations with Gov. Tony Evers — leading to the cancellation of the budget committee’s meeting Thursday and disappointment from child care advocates who had traveled to the Capitol that day.
The June 30 deadline for the 2025-27 state budget is quickly approaching and lawmakers still have major portions of the bill to put together. The GOP-led Joint Finance Committee was scheduled to continue its work by voting on sections related to child care, the Wisconsin Elections Commission, the Department of Justice as well as the capital budget. As the start time of 1 p.m. approached, a cancellation notice was released. 
Legislative leaders then put out statements saying negotiations with Evers had resumed this week, but were going south again. Negotiations had previously broken down with Evers saying he had agreed to GOP tax cuts but Republicans wouldn’t make concessions on spending for education, child care and other parts of the budget. Republicans said Evers wanted to spend too much. 
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said in a statement about the cancellation Thursday that negotiations between legislative leaders and Evers had been “good faith” with each party seeking “to do what’s best for the state of Wisconsin” since they restarted this week.
“However, these discussions are heading in a direction that taxpayers cannot afford,” LeMahieu said. “Senate Republicans are ready to work with the State Assembly to pass a balanced budget that cuts taxes and responsibly invests in core priorities.” 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) also put out a statement describing conversations over the last couple of weeks as being in good faith, saying work on a budget that “cuts taxes, puts more money into K-12 schools to stave off higher property taxes, and funds childcare and the university system in exchange for meaningful reforms” has been productive. But said Senate Republicans were the party that left the negotiations. 
“We have chosen to work together so our tax reductions actually become law, schools continue to be funded, Medicaid patients continue to receive care, and road construction projects do not stop,” the Assembly lawmakers said. “This is the most conservative and the most responsible option… We hope Senate Republicans will come back to the table to finish fighting for these reforms and complete the budget on time.”
Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback wrote in a post on social media about the meeting cancellation that “ultimately, the Senate needs to decide whether they were elected to govern and get things done or not.” 
Republicans have a narrow 18-15 majority in the Senate, meaning the caucus can only lose one vote if they want to pass a budget without Democratic support. Two Republicans — Sens. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) and Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) — have publicly expressed their concerns about the budget as it stands. Kapenga has said he would prefer for the state to not pass one at this point.
Nass said in a statement that Senate Republicans have been advocating for “tough but fair spending decisions” and the outline of the deal from the negotiations includes “too much spending, special interest pork and the creation of a structural deficit.” He said some legislators want to cut a “bad deal” for taxpayers.
Nass said there is “nothing preventing the Republican majority in the Legislature from passing a conservative state budget except for the lack of willingness at the highest levels in the Assembly.”

Democrats said that the breakdown in communication is the result of “extremists” in the Republican caucuses controlling how they have approached the budget talks. 
“Weeks ago, legislative Republicans walked away from negotiating with the governor in order to attempt to pass this budget through by again giving in to the desires of the most extreme members of their legislative caucuses, and instead they find themselves here again — unable or struggling to pass a budget and needing to talk with the governor about ways that they can finally do what Wisconsinites have been asking them to do all along,” Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) said. 
When it comes to the potential for Democrats to vote for the budget, Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said Republicans need to talk to them. 
“Ultimately, what we really need is for Republicans to pick up the phone for the Senate Majority Leader [LeMahieu] to decide that he is not willing to risk his majority and his more vulnerable members to kowtow to the most extreme voices… so it’s really just his willingness to pick up the phone and accept the reality of the caucus that he’s built,” Roys said. 
If a new budget isn’t passed by the deadline, Wisconsin continues to operate under the current budget. 
Child care advocates frustrated 
Child care advocates had traveled to the state Capitol Thursday in anticipation of the meeting, including Brynne Schieffer and Erin LaBlanc of the Faith Lutheran Child Care Center located in Cameron, Wisconsin. They traveled three-and-a-half hours to Madison and said they jumped through “a lot of hoops” to make it there, including asking some of their families to keep their children home so the ratio of children to staff remained adequate. 
Schieffer said they wanted to be able to advocate for the inclusion of child care investments in the budget. They support Evers’ $480 million request to continue funding the Child Care Counts program, which used federal dollars from pandemic relief to support staff wages without increasing tuition costs to parents.
“The meeting not happening — it’s definitely disappointing,” Schieffer said. “Our elected representatives [are] not doing their job. Can’t they get along? We can come in and mediate. That’s what we do.”
Schieffer said the families were supportive because they understand the stakes.
“We came down not only for us, but for them, for the child care industry,” Schieffer said. 
One in four Wisconsin child care providers could close their doors if the state support for centers ends in June, according to a survey of child care providers commissioned by the state Department of Children and Families (DCF) and produced by the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Schieffer said that the center would need to raise its costs by $28 per child per week to make up for a lack of Child Care Counts funding. She said that if there is funding they plan to put that in the contracts that families have.
“We need direct funding. We need to be considered on the same level as our public schools,” Schieffer said. “The direct funding comes in and goes directly towards the operation of the center, operational budget including staff wages.”
Corrine Hendrickson, owner of Corrine’s Little Explorers and co-founder of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN) said she wanted to be available if lawmakers had any questions ahead of the meeting and because she thinks it’s important that they look at the people who are affected when they take action on the budget. She closed her center for the day to be at the Capitol and isn’t sure she’ll be able to do so again when the committee eventually takes up child care. 
“It’s incomprehensible to me that they, as elected officials, can just walk away and not do their job when all kinds of… people were here to witness this, and they just can decide 30 minutes before that they don’t actually have to do their jobs,” Hendrickson said. “It’s also frustrating because these conversations should have taken place already and should be a basic agreement before they decide to schedule the hearing.”
Child care providers said Republicans’ plans so far for child care aren’t sufficient for addressing the crisis. 
Assembly Republicans announced their plans on Wednesday for child care including allowing 16-and 17-year-olds to staff child care facilities as assistants and to count towards staff to child ratios, increasing the number of children that a family provider can have from 8 to 12 and creating a zero-interest loan for child care providers and a 15% tax credit for the business expenses at a child care facility. Vos had said they didn’t agree with the approach of providing money directly to centers.
Hendrickson said they are the same ideas that Republicans introduced last session.
“We came out vehemently against [those] and told them exactly why this wasn’t going to work,” Hendrickson said, adding that since then they have spoken with the lawmakers championing those proposals including Reps. Karen Hurd (R-Withee) and Joy Goeben (R-Hobart)
“It didn’t feel like they were listening. It felt like they were trying to convince us that they were correct,” Hendrickson said. 
“A grant is something that you don’t have to pay back, and so you can use it to get yourself started. Because our profit is so low, there’s no way that we can take on that loan when our home is our collateral. If I take on a loan and my home is collateral and I can’t pay it back then, that means I lose my house.”
Schieffer said there are problems with the changes Republicans want to make to ratios. She said increasing the number of children per staff member could impact the quality of care and that minors don’t have the work and education experience that other staff members have.
“I work in a center where every teacher holds a degree in early childhood,” Schieffer said. “To be able to put 16-year-olds and say they can do that job without the education piece, the experience piece, life experience, I feel like that it devalues what we do.” 
Democrats highlighted the strain on child care facilities — and potential closures — that could result from the end of funding for Child Care Counts and argued that the state should have some type of grant program for them at a press conference Thursday morning. 
Democratic members of the Joint Finance Committee and Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) met at the Learning Ladder Preschool and Childcare center in Cottage Grove. The facility closed in August 2024 after over 30 years in business. 
“There are no tricycles in the playground. There’s no uncontrollable laughter among children, and the sweet sound of toddler feet running across the classroom is not here,” Ratcliff said while standing in a room full of bins of children’s books left over after donations and sales. 
The owners wrote in a letter about the closure in August that the solution would have been “Child Care Counts” funding, fair access to 4k funding and care and consistent regulations across child care providers.

“Unfortunately, our foundation has been slowly chipped away and we can no longer afford to remain open. After COVID, governmental grants and assistance programs helped prop us up for a while, but those programs have, or are about to end,” the Kudrna family wrote on Facebook at the time.
Democrats slammed Republicans for their rejections of funding for Child Care Counts.
“It is totally unacceptable that my Republican colleagues on the Joint Finance committee have, again and again, said to child care providers ‘your work doesn’t matter, it isn’t worth it,’” Roys said. “That’s what Republicans did when they stripped out the Child Care Counts funding that was keeping so many child care centers afloat and is helping bridge the gap between what parents can afford to pay and what providers need to keep the doors open in this time of high inflation and rising costs.”
Roys said lawmakers should be working on solutions that keep child care centers stable, not coming up with new proposals. Democrats on the committee said they had intended to introduce a proposal to provide grants to centers. 
“New theoretical ideas that Republicans want to propose are essentially wish-casting,” she said.  “We need to keep the centers that we have and the slots that we have open. We need to get more classrooms open, more early childhood educators to come back into the field.” 
“To try to start something from scratch is going to take way longer, it’s going to cost way more when we could just keep what we have stable,” Roys added.
Evers had also urged investment in child care on Thursday. In coordination with the Department of Children and Families, he released a survey that found that 90% of Wisconsin residents, including those without kids, said that finding affordable, high-quality child care in the state is a problem. Over 75% of respondents said they support an increase in state funding to help.
“This is an issue that impacts everyone in Wisconsin. It’s pretty simple, and as leaders, we have an obligation to the nearly 80% of Wisconsinites who want us to do something about it and expect their elected officials to show up, act in good faith and work together across the aisle to solve problems,” Evers said. “I’m urging Republican lawmakers to join me in supporting real, meaningful investments to bolster providers, cut waitlists and lower costs for working families.”

(Courtesy of Custer County Sheriff's Office Facebook page)A board chaired by Idaho Gov. Brad Little gave the state the authority Tuesday to pay bills fighting wildfires in the event expenses exceed the available funding provided by the Idaho Legislature.
The Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners, often referred to as simply the land board, voted Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise to authorize the use of deficiency warrants to pay wildfire suppression costs if those costs exceed funding available in the budget.
In the event the costs exceed funding in the budget, Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf would be authorized to draw deficiency warrants against the state’s general fund budget. 
Fire officials say Idaho has ‘greater potential’ for significant wildfire season this summer

The process is legal under state law, and basically amounts to using a credit card to pay wildfire bills that exceed funding.
Earlier this year, the Idaho Legislature voted to provide $40 million in the state’s Fire Suppression Deficiency Fund to fight wildfires this year, which is less money than the actual expenses the state incurred fighting wildfires last year, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Last year, the state spent about $58 million fighting wildfires.
This year, Little asked for $60 million to fund wildfires this year, but the Idaho Legislature only provided $40 million. 
The deficiency warrant funding authority the land board approved Tuesday comes as state officials are bracing for a greater potential for significant large wildfires this year due to rapid snowpack melt and forecasts for hot, dry weather.
During Tuesday’s land board meeting, Fire Bureau Management Chief Josh Harvey, Idaho State Forester Julia Lauch and Bureau of Land Management meteorologist Jim Wallmann briefed the board on the outlook for the summer fire season.
“So we’re expecting, really, the potential there for a very active season right now to continue into September,” Wallmann told the land board.

 Excess wildfire bills could impact state budget that has seen revenues fall below projections

If Idaho has a significant fire season this year and excess wildfire bills require deficiency warrant spending, that extra money could provide an additional hit to the state budget, which is already experiencing revenue shortfalls compared to the Idaho Legislature’s forecast. 
Gov. Little tells Idaho agencies, education leaders to prepare for possible spending cuts

Through May, revenues for the 2026 fiscal year that ends June 30 have come in about $141 million below the Idaho Legislature’s forecast. 
The state is still projected to end the year with a positive ending cash balance of about $278 million dollars. However the $278 million ending balance has dropped off from the larger $420 million ending balance that Idaho legislators were predicting as recently at the end of the 2025 legislative session April 4.
Depending on timing and costs, any additional wildfire bills from deficiency warrants could reduce Idaho’s projected year-end balance even more.
On Tuesday, Idaho Education News reported that Little’s budget office issued guidance informing state agencies to limit spending requests next year and internally prepare for midyear budget holdbacks of up to 6%.
Idaho’s economy is still healthy and strong, state officials said, but the Idaho Legislature approved more than $450 million in tax cuts this year that reduce the amount of revenue available to the state. 
In addition to the revenue reduction for tax cuts, Idaho is also seeing slower growth in sales tax revenue, which is causing the state to decrease its revenue projections for future years, state budget documents show.

The boiler is set to enter service in 2026 and will provide roughly 100 customers access to carbon-free thermal energy.
According to Vicinity’s website, their eSteam system uses electricity from renewable energy sources to power electric boilers and heat pumps, generating steam. Thermal storage systems are also used to provide steam on demand to customers through underground pipes.
“We are proud to see Vicinity, a long-standing energy partner in Grand Rapids, launch its innovative eSteam right here in the city,” LaGrand said in a statement. “This project will bring locally generated, carbon-free steam to our downtown businesses, supporting Grand Rapids’ commitment to sustainability, clean energy, and a resilient future.”
Supported by a more than $2 million grant from the Michigan Public Service Commission, the electric boiler marks the first new boiler at the facility in 60 years.

Janet Zander of the Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources, seated at right, also spoke. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Among the many people whose health care could be in jeopardy from possible Medicaid cuts, one group may be even less visible than the rest.
For elderly residents as well as children and adults with disabilities whose health care is covered by Medicaid, family members who help with their care will also be affected by the proposals coming from Republican members of Congress.
“Medicaid is the primary thing that supports family caregivers,” said Tami Jackson, policy analyst for the Wisconsin Board for People with Development Disabilities (BPDD), in a presentation to social workers Thursday in Dodgeville. 
The person under the caregiver’s care could be living at home, but will probably still require long-term support of some kind — support covered by Medicaid, Jackson said. Medicare provides coverage only for a limited time, such as when a person has come home after being hospitalized.
Private long-term care insurance plans “are unaffordable and they have not been workable for many years,” she added. “So Medicaid is it — and we happen to have a lot of people who need long-term care.”
Jackson and Janet Zander of the Greater Wisconsin Agency on Aging Resources met with Iowa County social workers in Dodgeville Thursday to explain the likely effect of Medicaid cuts that are part of the budget reconciliation bill that has passed the U.S. House and is now in the Senate.
The GOP majorities of both houses want to pass the legislation so they can extend tax cuts enacted in 2017, when President Donald Trump was in his first term. Those tax cuts have been found to heavily benefit wealthy Americans. Without action they will expire at the end of 2025.
Cutting Medicaid, hiking other costs
Medicaid is the single largest source of federal funds in the state budget — about $9 billion a year.
Under the U.S. House version of the budget reconciliation bill, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) has projected between 71,000 and 111,000 Wisconsinites would lose Medicaid coverage, including more than 3,800 people with disabilities and 2,400 older adults. The state’s federal Medicaid revenues would be cut by $501 million to $663 million.
The Medicaid cuts on the scale of those in current iterations of the bill “are too large to not cause states to have to cut many things in their state budget,” Jackson said.
The bill’s Medicaid cuts as well as changes it would make to the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplace — including ending subsidies that have made marketplace plans more affordable for lower-income people — would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 16 million in the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
“Whether you’re a caregiver, whether you’re on Medicaid, whether you’re working for somebody who’s on Medicaid,” everyone will be affected by 16 million more uninsured people, Zander said.
With more uncompensated care for hospitals and providers, she predicted that the cost for other payers will increase.
“We’re going to see premiums for any kind of [health] insurance skyrocket — the employer’s portion, the employee’s portion,” Zander said.
Reduced Medicaid care, more unpaid care
Family caregivers feel Medicaid’s impact in several ways. For many people who are elderly or have disabilities it enables them to get paid, professional care at home. If that care is cut back, that means more work for the unpaid family member.
“Those paid caregivers — they’re paid for by Medicaid dollars and there aren’t enough of them. There haven’t been enough of them for years,” Jackson said.
 If Medicaid cutbacks reduce the pay for those caregivers, the workforce that is already underpaid is likely to be even harder to find — making access to paid care even more difficult, she added, to the point where “it’s either the unpaid caregiver or nothing.”
Family caregivers who take on more unpaid care responsibilities may have to cut back on their own paid jobs.
“The amount of people who are reducing, limiting [work hours or] leaving the workforce because there isn’t a stable, paid caregiving workforce to provide what they need is huge,” Jackson said.
A BPDD survey found that for unpaid family caregivers in Wisconsin providing or coordinating care or filling in for missing care workers took 80% of their time. Two-thirds said caregiving had a negative impact on their family finances and 50% said they left jobs or reduced hours to provide care because there were no care workers to hire.
Unpaid caregivers who leave the workforce not only lose income but reduce the earnings that contribute to their Social Security retirement, Jackson said.

Kristin Voss, a Madison public school teacher for 24 years, had to retire to help manage and care for her 23-year-old daughter. Her daughter has epilepsy, autism and an intellectual disability and “functions at about anywhere from 6 to 12 years old,” Voss said in a panel discussion that was part of Thursday’s presentation.
Until her daughter was 21, she was entitled to public education, where she got “tons of support” including in her transition period that started when she was 18, Voss said. At 21, those supports were no longer available, however.
Her daughter enrolled in the state’s self-directed long-term care program called IRIS. The program includes a caseworker, but Voss also has responsibility as her daughter’s family caregiver, helping to manage day-to-day changes in her daughter’s placement and activities.
“I don’t mind doing these things, but there’s things that I don’t always know about and I’m not always prepared for,” Voss said. “And so, no, I couldn’t do this and be a public school teacher.”
Instead, she has put together a collection of part-time positions that give her flexibility that she needs — although none of them have health insurance, Voss said.
Unpaid caregivers ‘untangling the mess’
Some unpaid caregivers who leave the workforce may also turn to Medicaid for their health coverage because they can’t afford health insurance or work at a job that doesn’t provide insurance.
“About 4 million people nationally are unpaid caregivers who are in Medicaid themselves,” Jackson said.
Among the changes proposed for Medicaid is a requirement for participants in the program to prove every six months that they are still eligible for the program, instead of once a year, the current standard. Another change proposed is to add a work requirement for certain Medicaid participants.
Both of those changes will mean more paperwork. “Unpaid caregivers are the folks that are keeping people who are in Medicaid programs already,” Jackson said — by filling out the forms that are required to prove the person is still eligible.  
“Often these processes are so complex,” Jackson said. And when something goes wrong, because of an error in an eligibility form or a billing mistake, family caregivers “are the people who are untangling the mess.”
The current version of the bill in the Senate gives caregivers an exemption from the work requirement — but Jackson said the definition has raised concerns.
The current proposal limits the exemption to people who are caring for a person under the age of 14. National advocates have said that “really narrows that caregiver exemption and doesn’t quite fit with the reality that most unpaid caregivers are providing care for people with disabilities and older adults,” Jackson said.
Including exemptions in the proposed work requirement provisions also doesn’t necessarily reduce the paperwork.
“You either have to prove you’re meeting the work requirements, or you have to prove that you’re exempt for those requirements,” Jackson said. “And if you’re a caregiver who’s in Medicaid, you have to do that for yourself and probably the person you’re supporting.”

The intentional failure to perform an official duty or legal requirement.”  
If you think that sounds exactly like what Congress is doing right now as our nation teeters on the edge of yet another disastrous war in the Middle East,  you’d be 100% correct.  
While Trump ponders dropping 30,000 pound “bunker buster” bombs on an Iranian nuclear facility, he thinks it’s cute to say: “I may do it. I may not do it.  Nobody knows what I’m going to do. I like to make the final decision one second before it’s due, because things change, especially with war.”
Maybe some people think this is how to run a nation of 334 million Americans — and that the sole power to decide whether or not to drop bombs on other nations resides in one demented old guy in the Oval Office.  
But that is not what our Constitution says.  That 1789 document was written by those who had thrown off the shackles of the world’s most powerful monarchy, and boldly said in their Declaration of Independence that we govern “by the consent of the people” — not kings. 
To ensure that, the founders laid out three co-equal branches of government, legislative, judicial, and executive.  And when it comes to war, the Constitution is very clear.  Article 1, Section 8: “Powers of Congress: To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.”
Montana, like every other state, has two Senators, but due to our minimal population, only two Representatives.  They, not the president, have the sole power to declare war.  And using our military to drop 30,000 pound bombs on nuclear facilities isn’t some administrative action reserved for the executive branch, it is going to war without the required declaration by Congress. 
As Bernie Sanders, the Independent and most popular Senator in the nation, put it bluntly: “We ought to move as quickly as we can to make certain the president does not take unconstitutional action. It’s Congress that has the power to declare war, not the president unilaterally. And I hope members of Congress have the guts to do the right thing.”
Montana has two former Navy SEALS, Rep. Ryan Zinke and Sen. Tim Sheehy, as well as Air Force veteran Rep. Troy Downing, all Republicans, representing us in Congress.  Yet, these tough guys with “guts and balls” remain silent — and commit nonfeasance by ignoring their Constitutional duty to ensure Congress, not the president, makes the decision to take our nation to war.
Montana’s non-veteran senator, Steve Daines, is busy supporting an amendment to sell off hundreds of millions of acres of public lands while ignoring his very real and pressing duty to vote for or against dropping bombs on 92 million Iranians.
It’s not hard to determine if the American people want another war.  The latest Economist/YouGov poll is very clear that only 16% support military involvement in Iran, while a whopping 60% are opposed.  Yet, Congress is shirking its duty while the president ignores and denigrates the opinion of his own Director of National Intelligence with: “I don’t care what she said.” 
Once the bombs start falling, it’s too late. 
So, come on you tough guys in Montana’s Congressional delegation, “cowboy up” and do your duty.  The Constitution is clear, your role is clear — and nowhere does it say you get to hide behind MAGA’s skirts while our country goes to war.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219260257.jpg,,,2025-06-20 11:06:45.127153

(Getty Images)Exclusive restaurants can see their reservations snatched up within minutes of going live, and those coveted seats can end up on resale websites and bidding apps, often without the restaurant’s knowledge.
Now, New Jersey lawmakers are taking aim at underground restaurant reservations.
“New Jersey is home to many world-class restaurants who offer incredible food and hospitality to our residents and tourists. When companies begin to offer a marketplace for these reservations to be sold without the consent of a restaurant, it can potentially cause disruptions in business operations,” said Sen. Kristin Corrado (R-Passaic), who is sponsoring legislation to address the problem.
Corrado said she wants to tackle the issue before millions of people flock to New Jersey for the World Cup next summer and people begin paying eye-popping amounts for fine-dining reservations. During the Super Bowl in New Orleans, a four-person Saturday night reservation at a fancy restaurant in the French Quarter went for $2,138 on a third-party website.
Websites like Resy and OpenTable, both free platforms, already have agreements with thousands of restaurants. Other sites like Appointment Trader offer “user-to-user reservation exchanges” — paying top dollar to ensure entry to buzzing restaurants. Previously, the site was limited to hotspots like New York and Los Angeles, but it has since expanded into New Jersey.
For a reservation at popular Montclair restaurant Pasta Ramen, the suggested bid for a Thursday night reservation in July is $465. At Razza in Jersey City, the suggested offer tops $100. And Nobu in Atlantic City is more than $300.
Corrado’s bill would prohibit third-party reservation services to promote or sell reservations without a written agreement with the food establishment. Violations would carry civil penalties of up to $1,000 for each restaurant promoted, and accrue daily.
New York’s governor recently signed a similar bill, which took effect in February. Illinois and Louisiana lawmakers also introduced legislation barring the practice.
New Jersey’s bill, introduced earlier this month, does not yet have an Assembly companion. It awaits a hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee.

Bureau of Land Management officials say they underestimated oil and gas reserves in the region and will consider accommodating more development.
The post New federal estimates could open more of southwest Wyoming to oil and gas appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s effort to remove barriers to energy development within the 3.6 million-acre Rock Springs Resource Management Plan area will include revised estimates of oil and natural gas reserves, according to the agency.
“We previously determined the potential for fluid mineral development to be low, especially for the Red Desert area,” Kris Kirby, Wyoming BLM’s acting state director, told a legislative panel Thursday. “However, new technologies and industry interests have changed over recent years, and the reasonably foreseeable development scenarios will be re-evaluated.”
Those initial “low” estimates, which may change dramatically based on new calculations, will potentially be used to reduce restrictions on oil and natural gas development imposed under “area of critical environmental concern” designations in the Rock Springs RMP updated in December. That plan will likely change after a review spurred by President Donald Trump’s Unleashing American Energy executive order, and Interior orders under his administration.
The U.S. Geological Survey — the BLM’s sister agency under the Interior Department — released a report Wednesday revising estimates of “undiscovered, technically recoverable” oil and natural gas reserves underlying onshore federal lands, boasting “significant increases.”

The Bureau of Land Management’s Rock Springs Field Office, which spans 3.6 million acres, is in red. (BLM)
Factoring in the industry’s advancing technologies, as well as additional surveys and modern modeling, there are 29.4 billion barrels of oil and 391.6 trillion cubic feet of gas underlying onshore federal lands nationwide, according to the USGS. That’s a 274% increase in potentially recoverable oil and a 95% increase in natural gas compared to 1998 estimates.
In southwest Wyoming, and in neighboring parts of Colorado and Utah where the BLM manages much of the oil and natural gas estate, the USGS released new estimates of 703 million barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Though the Geological Survey didn’t provide context regarding the percentage increase for technically recoverable reserves in the region, Wyoming BLM officials acknowledged that the current Rock Springs management plan was based on “outdated” estimates.
“We’re going to be looking through those reasonable, foreseeable development scenarios,” BLM Wyoming Senior Advisor Brad Purdy told the Select Federal Natural Resource Management Committee. “We’ll be working with USGS, we’ll be working with the state of Wyoming and we’ll bring that into that evaluation.”
Rock Springs RMP
Meantime, the BLM is proceeding under the December version of the management plan for the Rock Springs region.
Though the agency is under orders from the Trump White House and Interior to review the plan and remove aspects that may inhibit energy development, the current plan still allows for robust oil and gas development that keeps pace with the industry’s demand, Kirby said. The BLM’s Rock Spring office has approved 27 permits to drill since January and is on track to approve twice that number this year, which is more than each of the last couple of years, she said.
“So we wanted to make clear that we have continued to permit and to do mineral development within the Rock Springs area and that [the Rock Springs RMP] has not prohibited us from doing that,” Kirby told the committee.
Before the plan was finalized last year, the BLM proposed excluding nearly two-thirds of the Rock Springs management area from potential mineral development by increasing areas of rights-of-way restrictions for things like maintained roads, power lines and pipelines — essential components to drill and ship oil and natural gas. But the agency slashed those restrictions by more than half.
Now, Wyoming lawmakers are eager to see the fruits of the Trump administration’s efforts to open the doors to further mineral development. Still, some on the legislative committee said they worry about what happens when a new leader eventually takes the White House.
“Administrations change all the time,” Casper Republican Sen. Bob Ide said. “Will [the BLM’s changes] get rescinded by the next administration?”
“That’s a great question,” Kirby said. “Our goal is to come up with a durable decision that will kind of survive, you know, different administrations.”

Tim Walz said during a press conference that the shooting ""appears to be a politically motivated assassination."" (Photo by Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

The congresswoman likes to remind us she upholds Wyoming values, but her actions in D.C. say otherwise, guest columnist Trevor Neilson writes.
The post Hageman’s stance on public land sales shows she doesn’t work for Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman likes to remind us she’s a rancher’s daughter from Fort Laramie. She wears the boots, speaks the lingo and throws around phrases like “Wyoming values.” But her actions tell a different story — one where the people she actually serves live in Washington, D.C., not in Sublette County or Sheridan.

Opinion

Take the recent push by Republicans in Congress to sell off millions of acres of federally managed public land — land that belongs to the American people and is cherished by Wyoming families in particular. The bill could open the door to selling large swaths of public land right here in Wyoming, threatening access for hunters, anglers, ranchers and anyone who cares about our wild and open spaces.
And where is Hageman? Instead of defending Wyoming, she’s making excuses for the very people trying to carve it up. She’s downplaying the threat. She’s calling public concern “misinformation.” And she’s echoing talking points straight from the beltway — saying it’s about affordable housing or “disposing of useless land” — even though the bill contains no affordability mandate, no environmental review and no requirement to consult local communities or tribes.
Let’s not kid ourselves. This isn’t about housing. It’s about greed. And Hageman is carrying water for the same corporate and ideological interests that have wanted to privatize the West for decades.
This is what happens when a politician stops representing the people who elected her and starts answering to the donors and powerbrokers who control her future in Washington. Hageman isn’t standing up to D.C. — she’s standing in line. Her votes and her silence speak louder than any speech she gives back home.
The truth is, you can’t claim to love Wyoming and also help sell it off. You can’t say you believe in freedom and then take away the public lands that make freedom possible for ranchers, sportsmen and working families. You can’t ride into office on a horse called “states’ rights” and then back a bill that gives Washington, D.C., the final say on what happens to our land.

(Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)The Maine Legislature on Wednesday approved a proposal meant to address the problems that both sides of the aisle agree exist for the state’s clean energy credit program.
While some wanted the proposal to go further in lowering costs for ratepayers, the House and Senate both voted in favor of LD 1777. Among other changes, it asks the Governor’s Energy Office to develop a successor program for front-of-the-meter net energy billing projects. The Public Utilities Commission would need to approve the plan, but only if the benefits to ratepayers outweigh the costs.
During the final enactment vote, lawmakers opted to adopt a floor amendment that clarifies certain provisions of the bill, including establishing December 2025 as the deadline for the new program. 
In the House, Rep. Sophie Warren (D-Scarborough) encouraged her colleagues to support the measure. “If we want to sustain public support for the clean energy transition, we have got to ensure that these costs are not unfairly growing, or that they’re not unfairly passed on to those who can least afford to pay them,” she said. “We need to ensure that this program, and these rates are sustainable and that is what LD 1777 does.”
Net energy billing is a policy program designed to encourage customers to install or participate in small-scale renewable energy projects like solar panels by offering credits to offset their electricity bills. It was expanded in 2019 so customers can use renewable energy generators located outside of their property but within the same utility service territory, such as a community solar project. 
Front-of-the-meter projects include community solar projects and those in the state’s current tariff rate program, which is used by nonresidential customers. If LD 1777 is signed into law, front-of-the-meter projects would no longer be eligible to participate in net energy billing once the successor program is in place. 
During a work session for LD 1777, Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said if passed the annual savings for ratepayers statewide over the next 16 years are estimated to be an average of $47 million from proposed changes to the tariff rate program and $20 million from changes to the kilowatt hour program.
Currently, the kilowatt hour program is open to all customers and provides kilowatt hour credits on participating customers’ bills if they install renewable energy generators such as solar panels or join a community solar project, where customers receive a portion of a solar farm’s credits. The credits expire after 12 months. This program, in particular, has come under fire for providing generous incentives to solar farm developers that utility customers are helping pay for. 
LD 1777 creates a monthly charge for kilowatt hour projects starting January 2026 to offset the associated costs currently passed on to ratepayers. 
While the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee rejected other proposals, including those to repeal net energy billing entirely, it carried over some legislation such as LD 1936 that could serve as vehicles for further tweaks to the program in the next legislative session.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s Republican leaders took a victory lap Wednesday for the U.S. Supreme Court decision backing their prohibition on gender affirming care for minors as one used it for a springboard to urge a national ban.
The court’s 6-3 ruling is not a landmark decision but says Tennessee’s law is legal in that the legislature has the authority to pass healthcare-related bills.
Describing the decision as a win for “freedom,” House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland urged Congress to adopt a national ban on puberty blockers and surgeries for transgender children, even if their parents want the treatment. Short of that, Lamberth said every state lawmaker in the country should pass laws such as Tennessee’s.
“Each state should be able to protect our children from bizarre practices that are not treatment, they’re not affirming, they’re not care,” Lamberth said.
The legislature is no stranger to getting into national debate on major issues. It passed a “trigger” bill in 2019 that led to the abolition of abortion when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade three years later. 
Lamberth and Sen. Bo Watson took up a similar fight this year to reverse a 1982 Supreme Court ruling requiring school districts to enroll undocumented immigrant children. That effort died at the end of the session but could re-emerge in 2026.
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson of Franklin, the gender affirming care bill’s sponsor, said the implication of the law’s effect on states’ rights “can’t be overstated.”
Johnson also mentioned that right-wing podcast host Matt Walsh deserves credit for the law for reporting claims that Vanderbilt University Medical Center was performing gender affirming care on children. 
“These are decisions that should be made by your elected representatives,” Johnson said, not unelected federal judges.

In response to questions about parents who might be making a last-ditch effort to keep their children alive, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said the ACLU’s own attorney told the court last December that gender affirming care doesn’t affect the suicide rate.
“I think a lot of parents have been pressured through the idea that you can either have a dead son or a live daughter, to go through with these treatments,” Skrmetti said. “The research just isn’t there.”
Skrmetti acknowledged these situations are a “heavy burden” for families but said that the overwhelming number of children who deal with what he called “gender confusion” in their youth will grow out of it, unless they take irreversible treatment.
Skrmetti further called research supporting gender affirming care “fraudulent” and described the case as one of “class warfare” between groups such as Lambda Legal and the Biden administration versus common-sense Americans. 
“When researchers actually look at the science and do clean science rather than ideologically-driven science, the evidence points toward not giving kids these treatments,” Skrmetti said.
Their stances didn’t exactly mesh with those of the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal.










As a parent, there truly is nothing more scary than watching your child suffer and having the government come in and displace your best judgment about medical care about your child.


– Chase Strangio, ACLU


ACLU attorney Chase Strangio, the first transgender person to argue in front of the Supreme Court, said Wednesday the ruling is a “devastating attack” on transgender people.
“As a parent, there truly is nothing more scary than watching your child suffer and having the government come in and displace your best judgment about medical care about your child,” Strangio said.
Lambda Legal’s Karen Loewy echoed that statement, saying the court’s ruling makes it harder for young transgender people to “escape the danger and the trauma of being denied that ability to seek the healthcare that they need.”
While the court found that Tennessee’s law doesn’t discriminate against children seeking gender affirming care, it didn’t endorse all of the appeals court’s decision after it overturned the trial court’s ruling.
“It did not mandate or even green light other bans on gender affirming medical care, even for young people or other forms of discrimination,” Loewy said. “It really is about how it viewed Tennessee’s specific ban in this way.”
In light of that, look for a landmark ruling to play out elsewhere, or maybe Congress will take up this matter — as soon as it passes the president’s “big, beautiful” budget.
The honeymoon is over
Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell started his administration in 2023 intending to build rapport with Tennessee Republicans on the heels of an attempted legislative takeover of Davidson County.
Less than two years later, that relationship appears to be on ice (pardon the pun).
Since federal agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted a sweep in South Nashville and arrested nearly 200 people, things haven’t been going swimmingly between the mayor and state leaders.
The mayor was meeting monthly with Gov. Bill Lee, but he’s not having beers with legislative leaders. And it’s not clear whether he talks to Lee anymore.
O’Connell, a Democrat, updated an executive order from former Mayor David Briley requiring Metro Nashville personnel to report encounters with ICE agents within 24 hours. Metro also inadvertently posted the names of three federal agents online but took them down, leading key state lawmakers to propose a bill targeting O’Connell or other local government officials who identify ICE people, even mistakenly.
Tennessee GOP Congressman calls for investigation of Nashville mayor amid immigrant detentions

House Speaker Cameron Sexton also urged O’Connell to rescind the executive order, saying it jeopardizes the safety of agents and accusing Metro of escalating the situation by turning into “big brother.” Maybe he didn’t know the order was six years old, and maybe we need a clearer definition of “big brother.”
O’Connell has been running below the radar — mainly pushing a Davidson County property tax increase to fund a transportation plan — while giving folks only an indication how he feels, especially since these dragnets affect his constituents. 
The mayor was caught between a rock and hard place. If he’d stood with ICE, he would have lost all local backing. Just the slightest show of support for immigrants cost him any backing from Republican lawmakers.
Joining the onslaught against O’Connell are Lt. Gov. Randy McNally and a host of Republican senators co-sponsoring the bill by Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson of Franklin. 
McNally doesn’t believe mayors should know anything about federal law enforcement activity.
Asked whether the mayor should be notified if Metro personnel come into contact with ICE, McNally said federal agents don’t have to notify the mayor if they conduct a drug raid. 
But what if Metro personnel run into ICE? “The more people that know, the more it gets out,” McNally said.
The problem is that when federal agents start pulling people off the streets and sending them to an El Salvadoran prison — probably without due process — the word is likely to leak. 
Also complicating the matter is that some of those sent to that prison entered this country legally, according to a study by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.
The legislature jumped on Metro Nashville three years ago with a spate of laws designed to give the state more authority over Davidson County decisions. Those moves came in response to the Metro Nashville Council’s rejection of the Republican National Convention, which, come to think of it, is held nightly on Lower Broadway.
Some of those court cases continue.
In the most recent ruling, an appeals court found the legislature has the authority to cut Metro’s council in half, even without permission from voters or the council. A majority of Nashvillians oppose the move, though some think the council could be more efficient if it didn’t have 40 members.
But while Republican lawmakers argue the state created cities and, thus, has control over them, those were obvious political maneuvers. Such moves are becoming trendy, putting up a higher wall between Republican lawmakers and O’Connell, whose city keeps churning out billions of dollars in tax revenue that keep the state budget afloat.
“Who’s on first? No, who’s on first”
Tennessee Sen. Bill Powers took himself out of the running this week for the 7th Congressional District seat being vacated by Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green.

That leaves only about 10 people in the hunt for the Republican primary.
On the Democratic side, potential candidates are former Nashville Mayors John Cooper and Megan Barry, state Rep. Bo Mitchell, state Rep. Vincent Dixie, state Rep. Aftyn Behn and Darden Copeland, founder of public relations firm Calvert Street Group.
Traveling abroad
Gov. Bill Lee and Economic and Community Development Commissioner Stuart McWhorter took another trip to Paris this week, not the one in West Tennessee, but the little city across the pond where they put the rulers in guillotines about 230 years ago. 
While there, during the Paris Air Show, Lee, McWhorter and Howmet Aerospace officials announced a company expansion in Morristown to create 217 jobs, in addition to 50 the company announced in 2024. Howmet employs 1,000 people at the Hamblen County plant where it builds aerospace components.
The Tennessee Lookout hasn’t been able to find out how much the governor and commissioner are spending on the trip. But it’s safe to say they aren’t having to keep the light on at Motel 8.
McWhorter and Deputy Commissioner Allen Borden spent more than $32,450 on a four-day trip to Sydney and Brisbane, flying first class and staying in five-star hotels on a recruiting trip to Australia last year. Lee and other state officials took a similar trip to France and Italy in November 2023 that cost $117,000.
The governor refused to answer directly about McWhorter’s expenses last year but said the state has recruited $35 billion worth of investments in Tennessee and created 200,000 jobs, making it a good trade-off.
So “let them eat cake,” the words that led to the decapitation of French Queen Marie Antoinette.

After three years and 1.3 million texts and phone calls, the national LGBTQ+ suicide prevention hotline is shutting down. The Trump administration announced Tuesday it was ending LGBTQ+ services for 988, the crisis hotline for queer youth that launched in 2022.
“Everyone who contacts the 988 Lifeline will continue to receive access to skilled, caring, culturally competent crisis counselors who can help with suicidal, substance misuse, or mental health crises, or any other kind of emotional distress,” the administration said in an announcement. “Anyone who calls the Lifeline will continue to receive compassion and help.”
The statement does not specify why services specific to LGBTQ+ callers are ending.
LGBTQ+ rights organizations decried the news as a crushing blow to young queer Americans, many of whom are already suffering through increasingly hostile laws and policies.
“This is devastating, to say the least,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of the queer youth suicide prevention organization Trevor Project, in a statement. “Suicide prevention is about people, not politics. The administration’s decision to remove a bipartisan, evidence-based service that has effectively supported a high-risk group of young people through their darkest moments is incomprehensible.”
The announcement came on the eve of the Supreme Court’s ruling in the United States vs. Skrmetti, in which the court upheld a Tennessee law barring gender-affirming care for transgender minors. The ruling is expected to bolster anti-transgender medical bans for youth in 25 states and risks undercutting constitutional protections for all transgender people.
Over the past five years, LGBTQ+ people have increasingly been the target of hostile policy and political attacks. Against that backdrop, the 988 hotline was praised as a lifeline for young people in desperate need of support. But the Trump administration’s moves to unravel diversity, equity and inclusion policies have undercut services for LGBTQ+ people broadly.
The Trevor Project, which staffs its own crisis line, worked with the federal government to field approximately 50% of the 988 calls. Six other providers also do that work. According to the Trevor Project, it served 231,000 crisis contacts last year alone.
The organization reports that LGBTQ+ youth are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide as their straight cisgender peers. According to their 2023 survey, roughly half of transgender and nonbinary youth had seriously considered suicide, and 41% of queer youth overall had.

""Frank was one of Tony's heroes,"" Park's obituary states. (Photo courtesy of the Idaho Democratic Party)About four years ago, I made a decision that enriched the lives of four elderly Idaho lawyers.
I invited Tony Park to join a weekly lunch trio at Eddie’s Restaurant on Overland Road with Wayne Kidwell, Duff McKee and me. He agreed, making it a lunch foursome. Tony was elected as Idaho attorney general in 1970, Wayne took that office from him in the 1974 election and Duff, a long-time friend of Wayne’s, had served for years as a district judge.
Tony was a Democrat and the rest of us were traditional Idaho Republicans, the kind that don’t thrive on divisive culture war issues.
We saw eye-to-eye on practically every important state and national issue. We discussed and “settled” most controversial matters. The best part is that we genuinely enjoyed each other’s company. We shared a reverence for the rule of law that is the foundation of the great American experiment. We had all served in the military, believing it was our obligation to the country. We all had learned that government can only work when elected officials work together to solve problems confronting the people.
It was interesting to hear Tony and Wayne talk about their hotly contested race in 1974 – all water under the political bridge these many years later. Tony left a valuable legacy for Wayne and the other attorneys general who followed in his footsteps. He established the Consumer Protection Division, placed a high priority on environmental protection and took pains to hire the best lawyers to represent the state’s interests. He did not hire or fire based on political affiliation and made it clear to the staff that he would not allow political considerations to influence the state’s legal work.
Tony chronicled his political life in “An Idaho Democrat: A Political Memoir of a Political Life,” published in 2021 by Ridenbaugh Press. It contains interesting accounts of his military service as a non-lawyer in a lawyer position; his career as a lawyer and politician; and his close relationship with Cecil Andrus, Frank Church and other Democratic heavy-weights during his lifetime.
Tony told his publisher, Randy Stapilus, that he wrote the memoir to show “how the Idaho political landscape — particularly regarding Democrats — has changed in the latter half of the twentieth century and early twenty-first century, despite the fact that many issues so important to Democrats, such as taking care of working people, the environment, the problems with one-party rule, etc., are as urgent now as they were when I got my start.”
Tony’s admiration of courageous elected officials was not confined to members of his own party. His book speaks highly of former AG Lawrence Wasden, calling him a “straight shooter and principled attorney who relies on the law.” That description aptly applies to Tony, both in his service as AG and in his private legal practice.
Tony was picked by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 to serve on the board of directors of Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). He was able to play a part in protecting America’s national security by countering Russian propaganda.
He was well positioned to understand the damage that would result from Donald Trump’s March 15 executive order defunding RFE/RL. It would give Russia a free field to feed misinformation about its genocidal war against Ukraine and other malign Russian activities.
Tony did not live to see it, but he would have been relieved that a federal judge ordered Trump to provide some interim funding and that the European Union regarded the work of FRE/RL to be so critical that it has offered to provide millions in stop-gap funding.
Tony passed away on May 23 at the age of 90 years. He leaves behind his soulmate of 43 years, Gail Chaloupka, as well as daughter Susan Park and son Adam Park. His daughter, Pattie Park Woytko, predeceased him. The remaining members of the Eddie’s lunch foursome were privileged to have gotten acquainted with Tony’s family.
Former Attorney General David Leroy told the press that Tony “was of an era when politicians, win or lose, were very genteel individuals. He was a gentle, caring man, who worked hard at everything he did.” Former Boise Mayor David Bieter observed: “The chasm between the way Tony carried himself and that of today’s lawyers and politicians unfortunately grows larger every day. He will be sorely missed.”
I can summarize the feelings of the three of the Eddie’s foursome that Tony left behind. He was just a good, genuine person. The kind of person you’d call the salt of the Earth – compassionate, willing to listen and willing to help whenever somebody needed it, even if it wasn’t within his official duties. We are all better for his example.

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)West Virginia University’s Board of Governors formally removed voting rights from faculty, staff and student representatives on the board, carrying out a Republican-backed bill that mandated the change.
“The board must amend its bylaws to reject the new legislative requirements,” Board of Governors Vice-Chair Dr. Patrice Harris said at board meeting June 13 in Morgantown.
  Colin Street
Incoming WVU Student Body President Colin Street, whose voting power on the board is now void, said student input should be considered on a board that last year voted to cut 28 majors during a financial crunch.
“Student input needs to be heard at every step in every decision,” said Street, 20. “I think it’s really concerning that the vote is taken away.”
House Bill 3279 made several changes to boards at state universities, including a requirement that one member be appointed by the governor to represent agriculture or forestry at WVU and West Virginia State University. It gives the governor the authority to appoint 15 members instead of 12 at WVU.
In support of removing the faculty, staff and student board vote, Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, said in April that only two Big 12 university boards have voting faculty members, six have voting student members and none have voting staff.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed the legislation into law in April.
WVU’s Board of Governors have now amended their by-laws to reflect the legislation’s requirements.
Ahead of the vote, faculty members raised concerns about removing their voices along with questions about the origin of the bill in the House of Delegates.
“Why was this done? Why did it threaten or what did it threaten?” asked Lesley Cottrell, a professor at WVU who serves as the BOG representative. “I would argue this was a short-sighted strategy because, while faculty, students and staff may disagree with some board members today, they may be the fiercest proponents of your ideas tomorrow. … Trying to strip them of their voice by limiting voting rights or consolidating power only weakens that engine. It’s an old tactic because it works very well.”
The bill was sponsored by Del. Vernon Criss, R-Wood, chairman of the House Finance Committee. During bill debate in April, Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell, also questioned the motive behind the legislation, saying that the origin of the bill was tied to House Speaker Roger Hanshaw’s unsuccessful attempt to be the next WVU president.
University president E. Gordon Gee will retire this summer. Michael T. Benson, current president of Coastal Carolina University, will replace him. WVU’s BOG voted to approve Gee’s successor. 
Hanshaw didn’t provide a response for this story. He didn’t respond to Woelfel’s comments during the legislative session. 
“ … [Hanshaw] voted in favor of it both times it came in front of the full House for a vote, so that would indicate his belief that it would benefit the boards of governors at both WVU and WVSU,” Ann Ali, communicators director for the House, said in an email.
Frankie Tack, outgoing faculty representative on the BOG, said the legislation “is now history.”
“I do remain curious as to who the original author was and who delivered the bill initially to Speaker Hanshaw. I certainly hope the rumor is not true that it was one of the people around this table,” she said at the board meeting, referring to recent discord among board members tied to the university president search. 
“Prior to the stripping of our voting rights, faculty had served as voting members of the West Virginia [University] Board of Trustees and subsequently the West Virginia University Board of Governors since 1989, and despite recent assertions to the contrary, we have served honorably with loyalty, without conflicts of interest, and without complaints from anyone, ever, including no record or complaint of any faculty member ever breaking the confidentiality of the board,” Tack said.
Street said that while university officials have continued listening to students, it was disappointing that he wouldn’t have a chance to represent students through voting power on the Board of Governors.
“I ran for this position in the first place to be that advocate for students,” he said. “So it was less a personal disappointment and more a disappointment that … my ability to effectively do my job and represent students is going to be hampered or more challenging in some way.”
The Board of Governors also voted 9-6 to select Robert “Rusty” Hutson Jr. as the body’s next chairman, effective July 1. Hutson is chief executive of Diversified Energy.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court this week upheld a Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming care for minors as a North Dakota court considers whether a similar policy violates the state constitution. 
In a 6-3 vote on Wednesday, the court’s conservative majority found that Tennessee’s law does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection under the law. 
It remains to be seen whether the legal challenge against North Dakota’s law, which went to trial in January, will fare any differently. Similar to the Tennessee case, the North Dakota plaintiffs claim a violation of equal protection rights. But they’re also asking a state district court judge to decide whether the law infringes on families’ freedom to make their own health care decisions.
Ruling in North Dakota transgender health care case likely months out as trial wraps

The U.S. Supreme Court’s majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, indicates states have broad authority to regulate transgender health care as they see fit.
Citing a previous opinion from 1993, Roberts wrote that the high court’s “role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’” of the Tennessee law but only whether it is constitutional.
Both the Tennessee and North Dakota policies forbid medical providers from administering gender-affirming care to anyone under age 18. Lawmakers who supported the bans argued that the science behind gender-affirming care is unsettled and that governments have an interest in protecting children from obtaining potentially irreversible or harmful medical procedures.
Transgender children, their families and medical providers filed lawsuits against both bans, arguing such policies unlawfully prevent transgender kids from obtaining the same medical treatments as non-transgender kids. For example, a transgender child would not be able to take puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria, but another child could take puberty blockers to treat precocious puberty.
In its ruling on the Tennessee law, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected this argument. The justices wrote that bans on gender-affirming care for minors don’t discriminate based on transgender status or sex; they only consider someone’s age and whether they are seeking treatment for gender dysphoria.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor in a dissenting opinion said the ruling “abandons transgender children and their families to political whims.”
Gender Justice, a legal group representing the plaintiffs in the North Dakota case, said in a statement that the Supreme Court’s decision “puts politics over science” and could impact access not only to gender-affirming care, but also other procedures like abortion and fertility treatments.
“Families — not politicians — should be the ones making decisions about their children’s health care,” Brittany Stewart, an attorney for Gender Justice, said in the statement. “Our case in North Dakota is still moving forward, and we’re committed to defending the constitutional rights of parents, medical providers and young people against government overreach into personal medical decisions.”
Gender-affirming care for minors hangs in balance as North Dakota trial begins

The North Dakota lawsuit alleges that the state’s ban violates personal autonomy, which the Supreme Court’s decision does not speak to.
During the trial, attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that freedom over health care decisions was an important part of North Dakota’s history and culture. One expert witness testified that since North Dakota was a frontier state, it embraced a “live and let live” ethos that made it more tolerant of gender diversity compared to other parts of the country. 
Attorneys for the state countered that there’s no evidence that the authors of the North Dakota Constitution were accepting of transgender people or thought they had a right to obtain gender-affirming care.
In some ways, Tennessee’s ban goes farther than North Dakota’s. Tennessee’s law says the state has a compelling interest in “encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,” and takes the position that gender-affirming care “might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.”
Tennessee’s law also establishes a blanket prohibition on any medical procedures that “enable a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex” or to “treat purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and asserted identity.”
By comparison, North Dakota’s law specifically bans surgical procedures and the use of drugs like sex hormones and puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria in minors. (Gender-affirming surgeries are not performed on minors in North Dakota, according to court filings in the lawsuit.) 
A final ruling in the North Dakota case is likely still months away. The judge’s decision could be appealed to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

(Spencer Platt | Getty Images)The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Stockton wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” he wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.
 


				“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death.” – Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery, MetroHealth medical center, Cleveland 



In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Legislation to protect a federal drug discount program from drugmakers’ maneuvers passed the Rhode Island House of Representatives Wednesday. With more guardrails in place compared to the original draft submitted in April, the proposed shield drew few arrows during a floor debate.
After bill H5634A by Rep. Jon D. Brien, Independent of Woonsocket, was introduced as item #10 on a 96-item-long docket, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi looked at the array of glowing lights before him. Each one signaled a member of the House who wanted to speak. 
“I’ve got a lot of lights,” Shekarchi said.
Most of the lights ended up being in support of the bill, a pattern reflected in the 69-2 vote which secured the bill’s passage. Another 67-2 vote affirmed the Senate companion, S114A by Sen. Bridget Valverde, a North Kingstown Democrat. 
Reps. Nathan Biah and Ray Hull, both Providence Democrats, were the only ‘No’ votes.
“I was surprised that there was that much opposition,” Brien said in a conversation after the floor vote.
The bill aims to stop drug manufacturer discrimination against hospitals and health centers enrolled in the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. 340B requires drugmakers to provide steep discounts on their products to program participants. Drugmakers absorb the discount, but insurers reimburse clinics and hospitals at full cost, and the savings can then be reinvested into patient care. 
In recent years, however, manufacturers have imposed restrictions on 340B participants that limit where prescriptions can be dispensed, especially those filled at contract pharmacies, like a patient’s local CVS or Walgreens, that fill prescriptions on a provider’s behalf. 
Manufacturers have tried to steer prescriptions to certain pharmacies, or limit the number of contract pharmacies a provider can use. But providers say these changes limit patient access, especially in more rural areas.
Rep. Susan Donovan, a Bristol Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Health and Human Services, said on the House floor that the legislation was tweaked to address numerous concerns that emerged earlier in the legislative session.
Who’s afraid of Big Pharma? Not the R.I. House’s lone independent

New in the amended version are requirements for 340B entities to submit annual reports detailing program savings and spending, including drug acquisition costs, payments to contract pharmacies, and details on how the money benefits patients. The bill also offers clearer definitions of contract pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers. 
“We think we struck a good balance addressing the real needs and giving people access to their medications,” Donovan said.
Rep. Marie Hopkins, a Warwick Republican and co-sponsor of the bill, rose in support.
“The 340B program is sacrosanct,” she said. “It is a federal program. It is a needed program. It is a necessary program, and it is vital to the survival of our community health centers.”
Hull, who voted against the bill, offered the only firm rebuke. He cited longstanding concerns about transparency in the program, while acknowledging that the program benefits community health centers, which supporters rallied around as a major beneficiary of the legislation. 
“What actually is happening here is that the hospital systems are now gaming the system because they can,” Hull said, and added that pharmacies can establish locations in poor neighborhoods, but redirect those savings to richer neighborhoods. 
“All I’m asking for is some transparency,” Hull said.
The 340B program has been subject to scrutiny in recent years, and research has found that an absence of rigorous reporting standards can obscure the inner workings of providers’ 340B participation. That’s one of the reasons Minnesota installed oversight requirements in its 2023 legislation defending 340B providers.  
But Hull’s comments set off a chain reaction among supporters who rose to defend the bill, including Brien, who asked, “If the hospitals were truly gaming the system…why have hospitals lost over $259 million over the last three years here in the state of Rhode Island?”

After the floor vote, Brien cited Landmark Medical Center as an example of how the 340B program can stabilize struggling facilities
“Come to Landmark and take a look,” Brien said. “And you’re looking at a hospital that went from receivership to where we are today, with a cardiac center and a cancer center and a great maternity center and psychiatric services.”
The 340B program is also getting an additional boost in the fiscal 2026 budget, with a clause that proposes to use the state’s Executive Office of Health and Human Services to align itself with some of the same actions in Brien and Valverde’s bills, such as preventing manufacturer discrimination against contract pharmacies. The budget clause also asks for annual reports from 340B providers and oversight from the Auditor General.  
Brien told his colleagues on the House floor that the legislation, which had tripartisan support, “changed the way I look at everybody in this room.”
After the floor vote, he opined: “I guess the one thing I can say is: No one can say that the lone independent can’t get anything done.”
The Senate will need to pass Brien’s version of the bill for the legislation to proceed to Gov. Dan McKee’s desk.

They didn’t tell people because they’d be ridiculed.”
Raymond is the founder of the Kentucky Bigfoot Research Organization. As KBRO’s chief investigator, Raymond says he has spoken with multiple people across the state seeking to unburden themselves of what he says are “traumatic” encounters with a creature well described in folklore, but not much accepted by science.
I’m speaking with Raymond after my curiosity was piqued by an accumulation of events. There was the reader who sent me Bigfoot “evidence” — photos of “footprints” in the grass. I squinted at them and struggled to buy in, but all I could make out were scatterings of dead leaves. Then there was the audio clip I received, which I was told was a Bigfoot, but which to me sounded like a warning siren.




				If you have encountered what you believe to be a Bigfoot, Charlie Raymond would like to hear from you. Contact him at charlie@kentuckybigfoot.com.			



But what really did me in was the time recently, when I was pulling my kayak out of the Owsley Fork reservoir and was startled by a man looking like Grizzly Adams who suddenly appeared and asked if I had seen the Bigfoot across the water. My head whipped around. Nothing there. That’s when I thought I’d better investigate this, if only to protect my sanity. 
From all accounts described by the sources I consulted for this story, Bigfoot is the generally accepted American term for a large, upright primate which generally eludes human contact, and which lives in forests. Sometimes he goes by Sasquatch, a made-up term composed early last century of words from a Northwestern indigenous tongue.
Nearly every culture on the globe has a mythology around their own version of Bigfoot, describing an upright beast with reddish-brown, black or often chestnut colored hair. Sometimes, the creature is described walking on all fours, but is mostly reported as walking upright. Some are smaller, but most top 7 feet.
Bigfoot’s place in popular culture seems to have been secured in the past 15 years. The Animal Planet Network’s show, “Finding Bigfoot,” ran for seven seasons last decade, and is still available online. Notably, it has been since then that Bigfoot appears evermore frequently on tee shirts, key chains, spoof traffic crossing signs and myriad other tchotchkes. 
For some, it all might be silly fun, but for those who’ve suffered long in silence, according to Raymond, Bigfoot’s entry into the mainstream offers them a chance to finally share their story.
“Now, I have more people coming forward with old sightings because it’s more acceptable,” Raymond, who has a bachelor’s degree in psychology, tells me. “It’s very emotional for them.”
What’s woo, what’s true?
The psycho-emotional aspect of this cryptozoological puzzle is one of its many factors that appeal to Darby Orcutt, M.S., a faculty member at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Orcutt teaches Science, Psi, Sasquatch and Spirits, a course he designed after having an epiphany while building a team for a DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) project at the university. 
The project was to create a microchip to be inserted into the human brain in order to directly perceive messages sent to the chip. 
“We were seriously talking about creating a technology for telepathy,” Orcutt tells me in a phone interview. “But what would happen if my colleagues were to approach it as though there might be a natural mechanism for this? Would that somehow be pseudoscience, or somehow outside of the academy?”

That question led him to study what is often considered taboo in academia, including the question of whether Bigfoot is real. 
“I thought the course would be a great lens to teach how science works and how science interacts with our larger culture,” Orcutt said. “I think that there are some areas where we really have the opportunity to help give explanations to things that people are truly curious about, and potentially discover new things.”
The course teaches how to use statistical reasoning to draw conclusions, so that students can find the nuance to the more typical binary “woo” vs. “true” arguments so often had at the fringes, according to Orcutt. “To my mind, we know that the phenomenon exists, the real questions I ask are how to explain it.”
“I study Sasquatch because I know the phenomenon is real,” Orcutt tells me. “I know people report seeing something. People are finding things and attributing them to this. You wouldn’t be writing this story if it weren’t a phenomenon,” he reminds me. “The real questions I ask are how to explain it.”
Orcutt credits the Bigfoot enthusiasts who apply the scientific method to their investigations, but rued the small size of the scientific Bigfoot community. So, he decided to help expand it. “I have a lot of collaborators from inside academia too,” he excitedly notes.
“My approach is that something has to explain that phenomenon, and I want to find out what that is,” he said. “And I am open to a wide range of possibilities.” 
Funded privately — “Nobody would give me a grant for this,” he laughs — Orcutt has started molecularly analyzing dozens of hair and other biological samples such as blood, collected by Bigfoot enthusiasts in North America over the years. 
Previously, a study of 30 such biological samples from around the globe, conducted by researchers at Oxford University in the United Kingdom, found two were of unknown origin. The authors concluded they had neither proved nor disproved the existence of Bigfoot.
Orcutt is also at work analyzing what he says is academically unexamined data on Bigfoot sighting locations, collected by a citizen science group, the Bigfoot Field Research Organization. “What are the patterns we are trying to figure out,” he says. “The wonderful thing about data science is that it can support other analyses. It’s not going to prove anything, but it can be suggestive of where we need to look further.”
 Apeman, ape or man?

So, if Bigfoot is real — what is it, a hairy human or a large ape?
To find out, I turn to Jeff Meldrum, Ph.D, a full professor of anatomy and anthropology at Idaho State University in Pocatello. As the founder and editor of the scholarly journal “The Relic Hominoid Inquiry,” he’s also considered academia’s premier Bigfoot expert. “Relic” meaning a thing that has survived from ancient times, and “hominoid” being the family of primates that resemble humans.
His first book, “Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science,” published in 2006, was endorsed by the legendary primatologist herself, Jane Goodall, who said his work brought a “level of much-needed scientific analysis to the Sasquatch debate,” according to the journal’s website, which features a photo of Goodall holding a copy of Meldrum’s book. A second Sasquatch book, he says, is forthcoming.
Bigfoot is not the “missing link,” for one thing, Meldrum tells me. “It’s one more branch on a bushy, bushy tree, is a better way to characterize it,” he says, speaking of the taxonomy of hominoids. “That branch may just be on the ape side, you know, if its greatest affinities are to something like Gigantopithecus, which is most closely related to an orangutan. Such an animal could have evolved bipedalism in parallel to the earliest Hominids that gave rise to the Hominid lineage, as in the early Australopithecines.” 
In plain English, Meldrum’s take is that Bigfoot is most likely a type of large ape that walks on two feet. He also tells me that it is like an orangutan capable of using tools, “but that does not a human make,” he says. 
Whether Bigfoot is more ape than man is a point of contention in the field, however, according to Raymond. 
“I tend to disagree a little bit with Meldrum on this,” Raymond says. “I think they’re more human-like. I’ve had many discussions with Meldrum about this.”
 Where’s the body?

To know the answer once and for all — ape or man — wouldn’t an actual body for the sake of study be nice to have, I ask my newfound Bigfoot friends. 
Given how much time I have devoted to the consideration that aliens from outer space live among us and that the feds are holding out on sharing what they know, I should have anticipated Raymond’s answer to my question. 
“I do believe we’ve had some dead ones that the government possibly has, but it’s a cover up,” he tells me. “I’ve got some testimony on that.” He won’t go into detail, but promises he will tell the whole story in August when he appears at ‘Spiracy Con in Cave City in Southern Kentucky.
Meldrum, the Idaho State prof,  is untroubled by the lack of bodies, and explains that since he has worked with a cartographer to map trends in Bigfoot sightings, he now has an idea of likely Bigfoot territories, which he says seem to overlap with that of black bears.
“When you’re out hiking, how many bear carcasses do you trip over?” he asks. “Not many, like none,” he answers. “If the bears have been extirpated, if the habitat has been degraded or overdeveloped to the point there are no longer black bears … then you just won’t see either one,” he says about both bears and Bigfoot, then adds, however, “Sometimes bears do get into people’s swimming pools.”

It occurs to me that maybe Bigfoot bury their dead, which would explain why no one seems able to find their bodies. Well, no one but the feds.
Madison County Bigfoot enthusiast and professional archaeologist, Gene Brock, agrees with my theory.
“It’s not a strange or unheard of activity in relic Hominids,” Brock tells me over the phone from somewhere on Interstate 75. “Neanderthals did it. Homo nadeli, they took their dead and threw them in a cave, down a pit. So, that’s very likely why we don’t have bodies.”
Meldrum, however, does not agree. “It’s unlikely for a presumed solitary species,” he says. 
That is to say, unlike elephants, Bigfoot are not thought to travel in groups. “Tracks and sightings are typically of solitary individuals, or presumed females with offspring,” Meldrum clarifies.
 Where do they live?

When I ask Meldrum where Bigfoot lives, as in, which states have the highest preponderance of the upright creature, he tells me it’s a tricky question. 
“You always have to treat that kind of generalization very tentatively because there are all these other variables,” he says. They do seem to consistently appear in bear territory, he says, but that the data are “messy” because they occur by happenstance.
“These data aren’t systematically collected by wildlife biologists that are conducting standardized surveys,” he tells me. “These are hodgepodge encounters, and almost every credible or substantial encounter happens purely by chance.”
A lot of so-called evidence, he says, is illegitimate, fabricated by hoaxers. Plus, in what seems to me a tone of annoyance, Meldrum says, “There have been sightings in every state except Hawaii … but the point is, something being reported and something actually existing are two different things. People also see dog men and orbs of light.”
He brings it back to the bears. 
“You can use the density of the bear population, not just the distribution,” he says. Where go many black bears, there go more Bigfoot, essentially. In states like Oregon and Washington, or in British Columbia, Canada, places that have among the highest reported Bigfoot sightings, the black bear population is also higher. 
“Idaho has 35,000 black bear, so that suggests a lot more area and a lot more resources to support a large bear population, and that suggests there could be more Bigfoot,” Meldrum says. “My rule of thumb is 200 black bear for every one Sasquatch.”
 Where are they in Kentucky?

Kentucky’s black bear population, depending on who you ask, is real but tenuous. In casual conversation, some environmentalists have told me that bear — and mountain lions for that matter — have never not existed in the state, but that extraction companies have helped create the notion that they don’t, making it easier to drill, log and mine without conservation restrictions. 
Bears were declared extinct in Kentucky early last century, but since 2006, the state has acknowledged there are more than one thousand black bears living here, mostly in Eastern Kentucky.
If Meldrum’s ratio is accurate, that gives the commonwealth about five Bigfoot. Raymond thinks it could be more, given the large sampling of audio, tales of encounter, and hair samples he’s collected from across the state.
“It’s very difficult to come up with precise factual information on a creature that supposedly does not exist,” he says, which it occurs to me, is kind of the same point Meldrum was making, but I realize this is the whole point — Bigfoot science is emergent, and still coming into its own. 
Raymond tracks sightings by county, and says Anderson County in the southwestern corner of the Bluegrass region has among the highest number of sightings, including of a Bigfoot nicknamed “Howdy” because of multiple people claiming he likes to wave hello. 
Raymond also notes sightings in Shelby and Trimble counties, nearer to Louisville, and plenty near where he lives in the Red River Gorge. There are also sightings among abandoned drill sites in Lee County, he says. 
In Madison County, Brock claims to have had two separate nighttime encounters with an angry Bigfoot that, on each occasion, heaved a large rock across the reservoir, aimed at where Brock stood with his sons at the boat launch. No one was hurt, according to Brock. 
As for Orcutt: “The most compelling potential evidence of Sasquatch that I have seen firsthand in the woods are two apparent trackways that to this day help keep me curious.” Those were just outside of Berea, he said.

 Are they dangerous?

Raymond says that in the nearly 30 years he has been collecting stories, he has yet to hear of a violent Bigfoot, but he suggests that is cold comfort for those who tell him they’ve crossed paths with it.
“These are face-to-face encounters, where it’s terrifying,” Raymond says. “The (person is) alone. The Bigfoot is standing eight-plus feet tall. They do look scary. And if the person runs away, sometimes the Bigfoot follows them, to escort them out of the woods and out of his territory.”
The terror drains and the peace of mind returns once these people tell their stories, according to Raymond. 
“More and more of these witnesses let me videotape their testimony of their encounters. That’s like a healing process for them, because it’s a relief to get it off their chest,” he says. “It’s like I am a therapist.”
 What if the conspiracy is real?

The more academics and enthusiasts collaborate, the sooner proof will emerge, is the fervent wish of Raymond, the investigator with the Kentucky Bigfoot Research Organization.
“Hopefully, Bigfoot will be officially recognized in my lifetime,” he says. “I will tell everybody, ‘I told you so,’” he laughs. “I do believe the government knows about them.”
If and when the mystery is solved and Bigfoot becomes a fact, Raymond says he will dedicate his life to protecting them. 
The first annual Red River Gorge Bigfoot Fest held last month was one of Raymond’s contributions to the pro-am Bigfoot field, bringing top researchers like Meldrum and Cliff Barackman, a Bigfoot hunter and former co-host of Finding Bigfoot, and the general public for a day of fun and education. 
“We had to turn people away, there were so many attendees,” Raymond says. “It was a free event, so I don’t have ticket sales to count, but we think it was over 10,000 people.”
Raymond also says the Bigfoot-enthused crowd was so large, it shut down the town of Stanton, and created massive traffic headaches. Next year, he says, “We’ll have better traffic control, and also fabulous guest speakers again.”
If Bigfoot is real, Brock, the Madison County archaeologist, predicts mayhem. 
“There will be religious turmoil. The problem with it is that it will not follow religious beliefs, that there is another line, not just Adam and Eve. It’s gonna change Creationism,” Brock philosophizes, but it’s industry that will really suffer, he thinks. 
“The logging industry will have to come to a grinding halt, because if you have an endangered relic hominoid living in your deciduous forest — and your non-deciduous forest, as far as that goes — then you’re not going to be going in and cutting logs,” Brock says. 
Meldrum, on the other hand, is pretty sanguine about it all, largely because Bigfoot are apes, not men, according to him. “It doesn’t prove evolution. All we’re talking about is a gorilla that walks on its hind legs,” he tells me. “This is not a type of person. It’s not even a close relative. It is, if it is in the Hominid family, it’s a very early offshoot that persisted alongside Homo sapiens.” Meldrum didn’t comment on the possible impact of Bigfoot on industry.
As for Orcutt, who has the honor of conducting what might be the breakthrough Bigfoot study, “It could indeed prove an unknown species, depending on what the results are,” he says.
As for me, I still am not sure what to conclude, but I will attest to this: next time  I see a bear, I am outta there!

Juneteenth has been a federal holiday since President Joe Biden designated it as such in 2021. It is an optional state holiday in North Carolina. An event long celebrated by Black Americans, Juneteenth commemorates the event that took place 160 years ago in which enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed — after the conclusion of the Civil War and two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.
While many businesses and government offices (including the North Carolina House of Representatives) were closed or on very limited schedules Thursday in observance of the holiday, that was not the case in the North Carolina Senate.
In addition to placing nearly 20 bills on the chamber’s calendar for floor debate (an unusually heavy load for a Thursday, which is normally a getaway day for lawmakers, and one on which nine of the chamber’s 50 members were absent), Senate Republican leaders scheduled a busy slate of committee meetings. Several controversial proposals on topics that included the confirmation of a new Stein administration cabinet secretary, concealed handguns, and gender-affirming health care, were debated and approved in those meetings.
But if there was a subject that seemed to raise the most questions of appropriateness on a national holiday set aside to lift up the end of the nation’s original sin of human slavery, it was the decision to schedule and advance the DEI ban legislation — a bill that was approved on a party-line vote in the House on May 1 and has resided in the Senate ever since.
  Rep. Brian Echevarria (Photo: NC General Assembly)
Judiciary Committee co-chair Senator Buck Newton (R-Greene, Wayne and Wilson) saved the discussion of the issue for the end of a lengthy meeting and the bill was presented by a freshman House Republican, Rep. Brian Echevarria (R-Mecklenburg) — a lawmaker who was not one of the bill’s chief sponsors, but who is the only person of color in the House Republican caucus.
In his presentation, Echevarria framed the bill — which seeks to ban all state government programs designed to promote diversity, equity and inclusion and that would subject violators to large personal fines — as a straightforward attack on racial discrimination, which he characterized as wrong in all forms.
Echevarria struggled, however, to explain details of the legislation or to answer basic questions posed by Democratic senators Lisa Grafstein (R-Wake), Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) and Dan Blue (D-Wake) regarding its mechanics, or the intent of specific provisions. Repeatedly, Echevarria responded to questions about issues like the standing of third parties to sue, and the reasoning behind the decision to shift authority for assessing discrimination complaints in state government to the auditor’s office, by attempting to defer to legislative staff or stating only that these were decisions that the House had made.

After allowing a few members of the public to offer very brief comments, Newton chose not to allow Senate Minority Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) to pose additional questions — saying only that she would have an opportunity at a later time and quickly proceeded to a vote. The bill passed on a voice vote and now heads to the Senate Rules Committee, of which Batch is not a member.
Grafstein concluded her remarks to the committee by sardonically observing “Happy Juneteenth, everyone.”
Other bills of note
Among the other measures advanced on Thursday:

House Bill 193, which would allow private schools to authorize staff members to carry concealed weapons on campus. Supporters described the bill as a tool to provide additional security, but critics warned that it would lead to accidents, confusion and more violence. The bill was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and advances now to the Rules Committee.
Senate Resolution 767, which would confirm Gov. Josh Stein’s nominee for Secretary of the Department of Adult Correction, Leslie Dismukes. Though they voted ‘yes,’ Republican committee chairs expressed reservations about the nomination and questioned whether Dismukes possesses the experience to take on the position. The measure was approved by the Judiciary Committee and now heads to the Select Committee of Nominations.
House Bill 805, which contains an array of changes sought by social conservatives to target transgender people and establish new rules for censoring access to schoolbooks and giving parents veto powers over classroom instruction. The bill was approved by the Senate Rules Committee and now heads to the floor.
Senate Bill 266, the latest version of a controversial measure sought by Duke Energy and opposed by environmental and consumer advocates that would, among other things, eliminate the goal for Duke Energy to cut its carbon emissions by 70% by 2030 — a goal that had been set in a law adopted in 2021. The Senate voted to concur with House amendments and the bill now heads to the governor.
House Bill 328, which would regulate hemp-derived consumables like and ban their sale to minors. The bill was approved by the full Senate and now heads back to the House for concurrence in Senate amendments.
House Bill 832, an omnibus education bill that, among other things, enhances the authority of the Charter Schools Review Board at the expense of state Superintendent of Public Instruction Mo Green. The bill passed the Senate and now returns to the House for concurrence.
Republican senators also tabled an amendment offered to House Bill 388 (a bill amending state business corporations law) by Sen.

While the recently-passed U.S. House of Representatives’ version of the President Donald Trump-backed “big beautiful bill” retained federal mapping that preserves Medicaid access in Virginia, a new draft in the U.S. Senate could alter two critical funding mechanisms that support Virginia’s hospitals and their ability to bolster the state’s expanded Medicaid program. 
The Senate proposal could change provider assessment rates and state-directed payment programs. The two funding mechanisms are critical to hospital operation in Virginia and how they chip into the expansion of Virginia’s Medicaid program.
Ultimately, the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association estimates each program could take a $2 billion hit,  if the proposal is fully implemented. 
“If you are taking policy actions that impact Medicaid, that is going to impact providers’ stability, access to care for patients and could destabilize hospitals or even lead to closures,” said Julian Walker, vice president of communications with the association. 


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


Provider assessment rates are essentially a type of tax that hospitals use to help cover the state’s share of Medicaid costs, allowing them to draw down additional federal matching funds. Changing that rate would also change how much money hospitals can tap into for themselves, and to feed into the state’s Medicaid expansion. 
Medicaid is a large federal program that helps states provide health insurance to their low-income or disabled residents. In 2018, when Virginia expanded its Medicaid program to make more people eligible, Virginia’s hospitals footed some of the bill for it. Walker emphasized that the two funding tracks the Senate bill is exploring are interconnected when it comes to supporting hospitals and Medicaid in Virginia. 
More than the potential for people to lose their health insurance,  Democratic U.S. Senate leadership has stressed how rural hospitals could suffer. 
“Enacting these drastic health care cuts that will kick millions of people off their health insurance coverage, rural hospitals will not get paid for the services they are required by law to provide to patients,” wrote Sens. Edward Markey, Ron Wyden, Jeffrey Merkley, and Chuck Schumer in a letter to Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. 
“In turn, rural hospitals will face deeper financial strain that could lead to negative health outcomes for the communities they serve,” they added. 
The  cuts federal lawmakers are exploring are part of a Trump-led effort to extend certain tax cuts and trim the federal deficit, while boosting federal spending on defense and border security. Legislators have explored cutting several federal social aid programs or incentive packages to achieve these goals. Medicaid in particular has appeared to be a potential target, as it’s one of the largest sources of federal spending to states.
While Republicans, which currently control both chambers of congress, have largely been on board with Trump’s plans, some like Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo, have expressed caution as lawmakers continue to workshop the proposals. 
Walker, with the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, also said hospitals in rural areas could see a domino effect of problems if the Senate version progresses as-is.  Rural hospitals are often a key local employer, Walker explained, and they also often serve sizable portions of Medicaid patients. 
In the meantime, he said that Virginia’s hospitals are engaging with lawmakers in D.C. about the issue.
The Mercury reached out to U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine’s office for comment but didn’t hear back by press time.

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)The Virginia Conference of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), the largest organization representing university professors in the commonwealth, is raising fresh concerns, after learning the George Mason University’s Board of Visitors inquired in February 2024 about their roles in reviewing promotion and tenure cases.
The educators say they fear the pipeline of college professors could contract if more college governing boards seek to influence the process of hiring and promoting professors.
The debate has bubbled up as the politicization of governing boards at public colleges and universities nationwide, including those in Virginia, has increased. In the commonwealth, the governor appoints members to these boards and appointees must be approved by the General Assembly. Now, as appointees appear to seek more input in teaching staff’s tenure, the AAUP said it could set a bad precedent.
“This is not their job to be academics,” AAUP Virginia Conference president Tim Gibson said in an interview. “They are the guardians of the process. They’re not the guardians of the actual content or making decisions about the teaching and research and service records of faculty.”
Va. lawmakers reject latest Youngkin appointees to university boards

Gibson said one of his chief concerns is that if the pattern continues, it could lead to an exodus of current professors and educators, and deter others from wanting to come to the commonwealth, ultimately resulting in a decline in quality at Virginia’s institutions.
Last summer, the regional AAUP conferences surveyed 2,924 faculty members from 12 states, including Virginia. The results showed that 58.7% of respondents would not recommend their state as a desirable workplace for colleagues, while 28% stated that they plan to apply for a job in another state.
Eight university board appointments by Gov. Glenn Youngkin have faced criticism recently, after Democratic lawmakers in the state Senate rejected them. Senate Privileges and Elections Committee Chair Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, referred to the appointees as “MAGA extremists” and “Project 2025 supporters,” who are opposed to Democrats’ progressive ideals.
Some appointees, including former Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli, are challenging the rejection that have prohibited them from serving on the governing boards. Youngkin has also challenged the decision.
At George Mason, one of the earliest signs of the governance board’s interest in tenure candidates came during a Feb. 22, 2024 Academic Programs, Diversity & University Community committee meeting, when the public learned that the board wanted more details about professors being considered for promotion and tenure candidacy. 
Kenneth Walsh, former interim provost and executive vice president at George Mason, reminded the board at the committee meeting that the review before recommending candidates for tenure is a “comprehensive” process after the institution reviewed 70 applicants for promotion and tenure between August 2023 and May 2024.
Gibson said the conference also learned that the board requested and was provided with complete dossiers of tenure candidates. However, since board members found the dossiers burdensome to review, they requested to inspect only the publications of faculty up for promotion and tenure.

The dossiers encompass performance and achievements in teaching and mentoring, research, scholarship and creative work, and service. Before candidates are recommended, their dossiers are reviewed by faculty from the department, the department administrator, the dean, and finally, the provost.
Gibson surmised that board members would only ask for the dossiers if they planned to make decisions based on the files. He said that if this continues, future boards could also use the perceived ideological and research content that professors publish to determine whether a faculty member earns tenure, which he said could be a “gross violation” of professors’ academic freedom and the institution’s integrity and independence. 
Horace Blackman, a former appointee of Gov. Ralph Northam and former GMU board rector, added that when the list of candidates reaches the board, “we’re certifying the process has been followed correctly.” 
He said the board meets this task by checking that the “deans, the president, the provost, etc., have completed the thorough and in-depth review and that they are certifying that they’ve passed through all of the hurdles successfully, all the criteria have been adequately followed, and we are certifying to make sure there are no issues, anomalies, or disputes in the process as we move forward.”
However, Visitor Jeff Rosen, a Youngkin appointee, pushed back on the rector’s remarks.
“I think it is the responsibility in governance if there were a massive and obvious error of some kind, the board has a responsibility to identify and address that,” Rosen said. “I don’t disagree with what you said, but I wouldn’t want it to be misconstrued as though somehow there’s nothing else that’s our responsibility.”
Gibson did not name any specific tenure cases that he believed were being politicized, but encouraged faculty to report any such cases to the conference. He also reiterated the conference’s commitment to safeguarding the integrity of the tenure process and protecting academic freedom.

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)Virginia is home to over a third of the data centers worldwide. These energy hungry facilities have brought business to the commonwealth, but communities are seeing the impact of the electricity and water usage hit their utility bills. Now, many localities are debating how to balance the opportunities and challenges data centers present, and grappling with how to regulate them.
York County supervisors created new standards for data centers to follow in a June 17 meeting.
“It protects the community from having massive amounts of power drawn off the grid and then all of us facing huge energy bills,” York County Supervisor Douglas Holroyd said. York County’s new regulations are an example of the stopgap solutions counties are finding for themselves, absent statewide regulations.
Lawmakers debated House Bill 1601 by Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, in this year’s legislative session, which would have set up statewide rules mandating data centers assess how they would impact water, forests, agriculture, parks, and historic sites before their zoning or special use permits earned approval. Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the measure, stating that it infringed on localities’ autonomy. .
“This bill limits local discretion and creates unnecessary red tape. While well-intentioned, the legislation imposes a one-size-fits-all approach on communities that are best positioned to make their own decisions. Data centers represent an immense opportunity for localities around the Commonwealth, especially those that don’t already have them,” Youngkin said in his veto message.
York County’s ordinance is for future proposals of data centers. The applications now must include letters from energy and water companies stating whether or not they can handle the needs of the facility when running at full capacity. If they do not have the infrastructure in place to meet the full needs of the data center, the board of supervisors could reject a proposal.
The ordinance also calls for a sound study. Members of the community spoke at the meeting about the sound of facility lights and generators potentially being disruptive to surrounding neighborhoods and natural areas. Similar to ordinances for solar farms, data centers in York County will have to be set back from other properties, vegetative buffers, and have sound limits. The county also put in place a five-year period where companies have to revisit the energy usage of the data center and report to the board.
Many of the counties with the majority of the state’s data centers have enacted ordinances to ensure community voices are heard and proper analysis of the construction and energy use of the projects are considered.
Loudoun County, which has one of the highest concentrations of data centers, recently removed the by-right zoning rule. This means that future data centers must go through the board to get approval. 
At local government meetings across the state, supervisors have  emphasized that they do not want to block data centers from coming, but want to have more of a say in how the process unfolds.
On Thursday night, Chesapeake City Council rejected a rezoning proposal for a data center, following environmental and residential disruption concerns from residents.
Last fall, Fairfax County passed an ordinance tightening up their rules for all future projects that include setbacks from other properties, distances from Metro stations, size limitations and facade appearances.
Not all counties and city councils have been able to agree on how to manage the growing data center industry. In May, Henrico County tabled their data center regulations amid on-going community debate. They were later reintroduced in a June 10 meeting and passed. It requires data centers to be 500 feet away from residential areas, substation screenings, and vegetative buffers.
“I am very concerned about slowing down data centers. The question in my mind is what is the best way to do it,” Henrico Supervisor Misty Roundtree said at the time.
Roundtree acknowledged the concerns of some data center companies who would not be grandfathered into the old rules and allowed to bypass new regulations, who said it is not fair that previous projects did not have as many restrictions and hoops to jump through. However, the new ordinance makes the rules retroactive to projects currently in the works.
In 2023, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission did a study of the economic impacts of data centers on the state. They found the industry contributes 74,000 jobs, $5.5 billion in labor income, and $9.1 billion in gross domestic product to Virginia’s economy annually. 
Most of these economic benefits came from the construction phase rather than data centers’ ongoing operations. 
The report also highlighted the challenges the state faces with building enough energy infrastructure  to meet the demands of the data centers, even without the added requirements of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which seeks to decarbonize Virginia’s electricity sources by 2050.

Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
States move to outlaw popular ‘Glock switches’ that make some guns fully automatic

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.










When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can't save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death.


– Dr. Marie Crandall, MetroHealth medical center, Cleveland


Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.
In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Members of the North Dakota Republican Party State Committee finally said the quiet part out loud.
This year’s controversial library content bill was not about protecting kids from pornography or obscene material.
The bill was more about anti-LGBTQ+ views, as evidenced by a resolution adopted by the NDGOP State Committee at its recent reorganization meeting.
The resolution that chastises the governor for vetoing Senate Bill 2307 doesn’t mention books. Or libraries. 
It describes the bill as “a necessary measure to safeguard children from dangerous, irreversible medical interventions and harmful ideologies that threaten their health, identity and development.”
It goes on to state that the state Republican Party “stands for parental rights, biological reality, and the protection of children from coercion, confusion, and irreversible harm.”
The resolution calls on Republican lawmakers to make it a priority in the 2027 session to pass legislation that “fully protects children from gender transition procedures and other harmful interventions.” (Lawmakers already banned gender-affirming care for minors in 2023, so it’s unclear what they’re calling for here. The law faces a court challenge. And doctors have testified that gender transition surgeries were not performed on minors in North Dakota, even before the law.)
The resolution does not call on lawmakers to do anything related to libraries or so-called obscene material, which is what proponents of the bill focused on during the session. The bill would have required school and public libraries to relocate books deemed “sexually explicit” to areas not easily accessible by minors. It proposed that state’s attorneys investigate and prosecute violations.
The anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment was apparent during the session, with the sponsor of the bill passing out a list of the most challenged library books, many of which had LGBTQ+ characters or themes. Another bill supporter pointed to controversy surrounding a book in a school library that was part of an LGBTQ+ graphic novel series. But the resolution makes it clear that the bill took aim at giving children access to LGBTQ+ books.
The resolution carries no weight and doesn’t even necessarily reflect the views of a majority of North Dakota Republican Party members. But it was supported by a majority of NDGOP district chairs who participated in the June 14 meeting, signaling the type of candidates these districts are likely to endorse. Republicans hold all elected state offices and supermajorities in the Legislature.
The State Committee adopted another resolution expressing anti-LGBTQ+ views as Bismarck-area community members gathered across the street at the Capitol grounds for an annual Pride event.
A resolution meant to support two-parent families defines marriage as a “sacred covenant between one man and one woman.” It references the “biological reality of male and female” and says families “anchored by a married mother and father” are essential to society.
The issue of same-sex marriage was raised in the 2025 legislative session, with the North Dakota House approving a resolution opposing it and the Senate later defeating the resolution.
The fact that the Republican-majority in the Legislature had already waved the white flag on some culture war topics didn’t stop the State Committee from charging ahead.
Members also adopted a resolution that advocates for making it a crime to get an abortion or assist someone in ending a pregnancy.
It’s a position that some North Dakota anti-abortion advocates have opposed and party members who participated in last year’s state convention rejected. 
The resolution says “preborn human beings are entitled to the full and equal protection of the laws that prohibit violence against other human beings.”
In addition, it states “anyone who purposefully ends the life of a preborn child is legally answerable for the crime, whether they be a principal offender, accomplice, or co-conspirator of the act.”
The resolution also notes that medication abortion is readily accessible and “abortion will remain widespread and legal in North Dakota as long as abortions can be self-administered with impunity.”
Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, a stalwart anti-abortion advocate in the Legislature, opposed the similarly worded resolution considered at the state convention last year. In an interview this week, Myrdal said she hadn’t seen the latest version but continues to disagree with the approach.
“I just don’t think there’s any purpose in putting women in jail,” Myrdal said.
During the legislative session earlier this year, lawmakers voted down a fetal personhood bill that would have allowed women who obtain abortions to be charged with murder.
North Dakota in 2023 outlawed all abortions except when the pregnancy posed a serious health risk to the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest in the first six weeks of pregnancy. That law was deemed unconstitutional and struck down by a district court judge last fall, who found that women have a right to obtain an abortion until the point of fetal viability. The North Dakota Supreme Court has yet to rule on the state’s appeal.
State Committee members also supported the display of the Ten Commandments on government property and public schools, similar to legislation that failed earlier this year.
Brady Pelton, chair of Bismarck’s District 32, said he was “extremely disappointed” with some of the resolutions. He said the resolutions, which passed with split votes, didn’t go through the usual vetting process and don’t fully reflect the views of North Dakota Republicans.
Even though these resolutions carry no weight, they’re an indication that the push for culture war bills that many North Dakotans are tired of is likely to continue.

Republish photo only with original article.)Pro-abortion rights advocates are taking a proposed total abortion ban in Ohio to heart. Noting the celebration of Juneteenth and Black emancipation, they say the use of the 14th Amendment to try to exert state control over individual freedom and bodily autonomy is vile.
The new bill a pair of freshman Republican House lawmakers are planning to introduce would ban abortion and criminalize it, along with in-vitro fertilization and certain types of contraception. The measure’s filing was first reported by WEWS.
The bill is meant as a direct challenge to the state reproductive rights amendment passed by 57% of Ohio voters in 2023.
Bill supporters say the current constitutional amendment that enshrined reproductive rights into the Ohio Constitution “should be treated as null and void” because, they claim, it violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment “by denying pre-born persons the right to life.”
The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects citizenship and due process, along with equal protection under the law.
“In appealing to the 14th Amendment, the Ohio Prenatal Equal Protection Act appeals to a higher law; the U.S. Constitution,” the anti-abortion group End Abortion Ohio, who is leading the charge on the bill, said in a statement.
Republican lawmakers in Ohio to propose total abortion and IVF ban

Austin Biegel, a member of End Abortion Ohio, argued that yes, the bill would go against the majority public opinion of Ohioans, but he justified it by arguing that slavery was once also supported and legal in the U.S.
Lexi Dotson-Dufault, executive director of the resource and referral service Abortion Fund Ohio, called the use of the 14th Amendment as part of an abortion ban bill “vile.”
“A bill that bans abortion while citing the 14th Amendment misuses a civil rights protection to justify state control over our marginalized community members, especially Black people,” Dotson-Dufault said.
A report from the National Partnership for Women & Families in May of last year found that state abortion bans “exacerbate the existing Black maternal mortality crisis,” and “threaten” 7 million Black women nationwide.
The study found that mothers who can’t access abortion care see negative impacts to their “economic security and development of their existing children.”
‘Canary in the coal mine’
Dotson-Dufault and Ohio Women’s Alliance Deputy Director Jordyn Close believe Republican legislators are emboldened to attempt anti-abortion measures in part because of a Missouri Supreme Court ruling that reinstated a “de facto abortion ban” in May, lifting an injunction that had blocked abortion restrictions.

The decision came months after that state also approved an amendment to its constitution that protected reproductive rights.
The pro-abortion rights advocates see no legal standing for the new abortion ban bill, but they also see abortion rights as “the canary in the coal mine when it comes to … rights being stripped away from people.”
“I don’t think that this bill has any legs to stand on, but I do think that it’s very important to highlight just how gross it is that they would even try it,” Close said. “Because if it’s not this bill, it will be another one introduced in the next session … it just continues because they do not respect Ohioans.”
Ohio’s constitutional amendment, passed in 2023, protects abortion and other types of reproductive health like fertility treatments and miscarriage care, but more than 30 other regulations still sit on the books in Ohio law.
Those statutes would have to be undone one by one, even though state courts have blocked some of the laws, as well as a six-week abortion ban that was on the books before Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.
But Republicans in the state legislature are also trying to double-down on such regulations.
State Reps. Mike Odioso and Josh Williams have already filed House Bill 347, a bill which targets informed consent, requiring that 24 hours before an abortion doctors provide not only “medically accurate information that a reasonable patient would consider material to the decision of whether to undergo the elective abortion” — which abortion providers have said they are already required to do — but also “alternatives to abortion, including adoption and parenting.”
H.B. 347 also puts into law medically controversial and unproven language that “it may be possible to reverse the effects of the abortion-inducing drug” if a medication abortion is taking place.
This isn’t the first time Ohio lawmakers have attempted to include this language in state law.
The bill also requires a physician to notify the pregnant person, except in the case of rape or incest, “that the unborn child’s father has a child support obligation, even if the father has offered to pay for the elective abortion.”
According to a recent midyear analysis from the Guttmacher Institute, 13 states have total abortion bans on the books, with another 28 that have bans between six weeks of gestation and “viability.”
Ohio’s constitutional amendment places abortion legality at viability, as determined by an individual’s physician.
The institute’s report also said the first half of 2025 has given rise to anti-abortion state lawmakers who “have continued to push the envelope toward pregnancy criminalization, restrictions on bodily autonomy and laws that recognize fetal and embryonic personhood,” while also reducing funding for resources like sex education.

The state-level action comes as the Trump administration spent its first few months in office revoking Biden-era executive orders on abortion, including patient privacy protections, and rolling back guidance on access to emergency abortion care under the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act.
President Donald Trump also pardoned nearly two dozen people convicted under a federal law that bans threats, physical obstruction or force at the entrances to reproductive health clinics.
The language of that federal law for which Trump issued pardons also bars interference, injury or intimidation for any exercise of First Amendment religious freedom, including at places of worship.
Efforts to slash federal funding have also touched reproductive health, with cuts to Title X, which funds “family planning” grants and other reproductive health services for low-income individuals, including many services in Ohio.
Pro-abortion rights groups have already started their fight against the total abortion ban bill with a demonstration on Wednesday that interrupted an anti-abortion gathering in the Statehouse.
They want to spend more time not only raising their voices in the halls of the legislature, but also educating the voters going into 2026 elections.
“Even though we had a moment of victory in 2023, the fight is far from over,” Close said. “We have to look toward the next electoral (cycle) to protect our courts, because inevitably when we have these showdowns in the state legislature, the courts is where everything ends up.”
A spokesperson for Oho House Speaker Matt Huffman said Huffman’s focus remains on the state operating budget until its July 1 deadline, and had no other information on the bill’s introduction or timeline.
A request for comment from Senate President Rob McColley on whether he would consider such a bill went unanswered on Wednesday.
Back in November 2024, just before he began his tenure as Senate president, McColley told the Capital Journal “the inaction on the issue kind of speaks for itself,” referring to any effort to undermine the constitutional amendment. He also said since the issue had passed the year before, “there really hasn’t been a lot of discussion about it.”
“I think, by and large, people realize Ohioans spoke, and that’s the way it is right now,” McColley said then.
The Ohio Democratic Party said they were staunchly against the abortion ban measure, questioning the priorities of state Republicans, and saying the party with the Statehouse supermajority is attempting to “drag our state into the past.”
“Ohio women would die under this cruel, disastrous legislation,” said Ohio Democratic Party Chair Kathleen Clyde.

It’s summer beach season again. Over the coming months, millions of visitors will flock to the North and South Carolina coastlines and fuel a tourism-based economy that’s critically important to both states.
Unfortunately, powerful forces could soon jeopardize this amazing natural and economic resource by opening it to offshore oil and gas drilling.
Thankfully, a bipartisan chorus is pushing back. Recently, North Carolina’s Democratic governor, Josh Stein and his Republican counterpart from South Carolina, Henry McMaster, called on the Trump administration to maintain the current drilling moratorium.
As the governors noted, quote “Because of the significant risks associated with offshore oil and gas exploration, every North Carolina and South Carolina coastal municipality has passed a resolution opposing offshore drilling and seismic testing.”
The bottom line: Especially as the global climate crisis worsens, offshore oil and gas drilling is the last thing our fragile coastline needs. Kudos to Governors Stein and McMaster for taking a strong stand.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Many State Capitols Have Security Holes

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
NM lawmakers review security practices after Minnesota assassination

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Amid new restrictions imposed on federal grants that aid victims of sexual or domestic violence, multiple groups from 17 states, including Pennsylvania and Virginia, signed onto a complaint challenging its legality.
In a complaint filed this week against the U.S. Department of Justice and others, several victims’ service groups from multiple states are seeking an injunction on new restrictions that the federal government has placed on the grants. Plaintiffs include including the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance, and entities from 15 other states.
Since taking office earlier this year, President Donald Trump’s administration has targeted  a range of federal funding in opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and institutions that support transgender people. The new restrictions placed on the federal grants for sexual and domestic violence victims mean that organizations deemed to “promote gender ideology” or operate DEI programs could have funding blocked.
This goes against how congress established and amended the grants over the years, the plaintiffs argue, as grantees cannot be discriminated against on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or disability.
As Congress controls the nation’s purse strings, the plaintiffs allege that Trump’s imposed restrictions on the grants overstep his authority. The grants, created over 30 years ago, stem from the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 and the Violence Against Women Act and have bolstered organizations that support victims through legal services, housing assistance and crisis counseling.


Federal fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest >


Nonprofit organizations like the Virginia Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance have tapped into the federal funding to support their programming and assistance to victims.
“Holding this field’s already very limited funding hostage is unconscionable, and it undermines the fundamental right of all survivors to access safety, justice and healing in the aftermath of violence,” said Action Alliance executive director Kristi VanAudenhove in a statement.
Jonathan Yglesias, also with Action Alliance, called the restrictions “arbitrary” and “vague.”
The funding restrictions appear to be in alignment with an executive order Trump issued earlier this year titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.”
Action Alliance, Yglesias emphasized, does not discriminate against the domestic violence victims it serves.
He also underscored the role his organization acts as a resource for people as they sort out what types of assistance they may need in a crisis. Yglesias said that transgender people or immigrants have called Action Alliance’s hotline for initial advice following their alleged experiences with sexual or domestic violence to “test the waters,” before they may feel comfortable reporting to local law enforcement or reaching out to hyperlocal organizations.
Lack of clarity around what the Trump administration would consider “illegal DEI” means grantees could potentially set themselves up for litigation or fines if they accept a grant and are deemed to operate outside of the administration’s impositions on it, Yglesias explained.
“I think the intent of that message is that ‘your choice is to stop accepting these funds or change your work to fit the mold that we’ve created,’” Yglesias said.
But before that perceived intention turns into actual consequences, Action Alliance and others in the suit spanning 17 states said they hope an injunction will be placed on the Trump administration’s changes.

Ned Lamont and state officials from both sides of the aisle proposed measures aimed at reining in private equity in the state’s health care system. 
But when the 2025 legislative session drew to a close in the first week of June, Connecticut had failed, for the second year in a row, to pass any legislation related to private equity ownership of health care facilities. 
Two competing bills, one from the governor and one from the Senate, each laid out an approach for protecting the state’s health care system from potential bad actors. 
The governor’s proposal sought to increase oversight of major health care industry transactions — such as hospital mergers and acquisitions — by broadening the types of deals that would require state review to include those typically used by private equity-backed operators. The Senate bill focused on banning private equity involvement outright in certain parts of the health care system. 
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for the governor, laid the blame for the failure to make progress on the issue of private equity squarely at the feet of legislators. 
“Despite the Governor’s best efforts to work collaboratively with the public health committee on private equity, the co-chairs chose to not bring out a single bill on this issue and took no action. Only the legislature can bring out legislation and move it forward. Any inaction on this issue lies with them,” Blanchard wrote in an emailed statement.
Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, said lawmakers failed to thread the different approaches in time to get a bill passed.
“It’s like a funnel,” McCarthy Vahey said. “As we get closer to the end of session, it gets harder to get anything through, let alone something that involves the complex systems that we have in health care.”
Sen. Saud Anwar, a South Windsor Democrat and McCarthy Vahey’s co-chair, blamed the governor more directly. Anwar, who championed the Senate bill, said he had amended the proposal to address concerns from the health care industry and had buy-in from hospitals and physician practices. But when Anwar felt like he had reached a deal, he said Senate leadership informed him the chamber would not be taking up the bill at the direction of the governor’s office. 
“We had a responsibility to pass a bill, and I still to this day cannot understand why we did not do that,” Anwar said, calling it “legislative malpractice not to pass a bill after what the state has endured.”
Several states have tried and failed to pass legislation regulating private equity in health care. But earlier this year, facing similar impacts from private equity ownership of hospitals, Massachusetts enacted a law that combined increased transparency with bans on certain transactions. 
Massachusetts also added increased oversight for significant equity investors, including private equity investors. And the law banned hospitals from selling off their main campus buildings in transactions known as “sale-leasebacks,” a popular tool for private equity-backed hospital operators looking to generate profits.
Increased oversight
Gov. Lamont’s bill sought to, among other things, broaden the scope of health care transactions that require Attorney General review and require health care operators to notify the state 60 days in advance of any “material changes,” such as changes in ownership, transfers of assets and merging of practices.
The proposal would have required health operators to report to the state the types of transactions executed by Prospect, including sale-leasebacks, which many believe sacrificed the financial health of the company’s three Connecticut hospitals in order to generate profits for investors. 
Sale-leasebacks work like this: Hospital operators sell the land and buildings from the hospitals it owns to a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and then lease that property back from the trust. The operating company gets the profit from the sale, but the hospitals are stuck paying rent that, in the vast majority of cases, amounts to a new major expense. 
In 2018, Prospect took out a $1.1 billion loan that it used to pay its executives and shareholders a $457 million dividend, CBS News reported. To repay the loan, Prospect entered into a sale-leaseback agreement, selling the land and buildings from the hospitals it owned in Connecticut, California and Pennsylvania to a real estate investment trust for $1.4 billion.
Prospect Medical Holdings did not respond to a request for comment.
The state’s current approval process for major health care transactions is known as “certificate of need.” Over the past several years, legislators from both sides of the aisle, as well as providers, have voiced concerns that the process needs major overhauls. A bill that effectively expanded the requirements for state approval of major transactions was a non-starter, Anwar said.
“There was value in what [the governor] was proposing, except they were asking for a new [certificate of need] process. And I was informed by my Republican colleagues that that bill would never pass the Senate,” Anwar said. 
There was also disagreement between the Connecticut Hospital Association and the state’s Office of Health Strategy over the measures in the governor’s bill that “we weren’t really able to overcome,” McCarthy Vahey said.
A spokesperson with the Connecticut Hospital Association said the industry recognizes the negative outcomes of unregulated private equity in certain situations and that hospitals support “balanced measures” to protect the interests of patients and communities.
“Any solution must be carefully crafted to avoid unintended consequences, such as discouraging modest yet important investments that can support and sustain healthcare delivery in Connecticut,” the spokesperson wrote in a statement. 
OHS commissioner Deidre Gifford wrote in a statement that the agency has “seen the detrimental impact of private equity” and supported the governor’s “sensible proposal to enhance the oversight and monitoring of private equity in health care.”
“As with all proposals that impact health care business interests, there was intense lobbying by interested stakeholders,” Gifford stated.
McCarthy Vahey also noted that the governor’s proposal would have required funding not included in the budget for additional staff in both the Attorney General’s office and the Office of Health Strategy.
A private equity ban
Anwar instead threw his efforts into reaching a deal on Senate Bill 1507, which originally sought to prohibit private equity ownership of hospitals and group practices and also sought to ban health care entities from selling their land and property to REITs through sale-leaseback agreements.
After hearing feedback from the hospitals and physician practices, in particular, Anwar amended the original bill language to remove any regulation of private equity ownership of physician practices and allow hospitals to access private equity investment in certain joint ventures, including urgent care centers and outpatient surgical sites. He also changed the language to permit sale-leasebacks of hospital real estate in situations of extreme financial distress. 
Blanchard, the governor’s spokesperson, didn’t address a question regarding whether the governor’s office directed Senate leadership not to vote on the bill. But he acknowledged the governor’s office expressed concern to Senate leadership that the amendment as proposed could have favored some potential bidders for the hospitals over others.
Leadership from both chambers said, from their perspective, the bill never got to a place where it was ready for a vote. 
“Since no agreement was reached between the Governor’s office and the General Assembly, the Senate chose not to take up SB 1507 in the final two weeks of legislation,” Senate President Martin M. Looney of New Haven wrote in an emailed statement. 
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, agreed and said in the future there would need to be more of a “meeting of the minds of the Public Health Committee leadership” in order to get legislation passed.
McCarthy Vahey vowed to continue the effort.

(Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)As masked federal officers raise fears by raiding workplaces and courthouses and detaining elected officials who object, Ohio’s Geauga County is fighting to keep secret its contract to jail immigrants those officers arrest.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio last month sued Geauga County when the county failed to provide a copy of its contract to jail people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The ACLU is asking the Ohio Supreme Court to issue a writ mandating that Geauga County, which is just east of Cleveland, turn over the contract.
The ACLU contends that such a contract between two public entities is a public document. For its part, the county is arguing that only ICE can release it.
In a court filing Tuesday, Geauga County lawyers said “they have not denied that they possess these records at the time of this filing, and that they have asserted that the requested records are prohibited by disclosure under federal law, and therefore exempted from disclosure under the Ohio Public Records Act, specifically, RC 149.43(A)(1)(v).”
The provision cited under the Ohio public records law says that state officials can’t release “records the release of which is prohibited by state or federal law.” 
However, Geauga County didn’t cite any part of state or federal law saying that ICE detention contracts are exempt from release.
As a general matter, government documents can usually only be withheld or redacted if they contain sensitive personal information, business secrets, would compromise a law-enforcement investigation or if their disclosure would endanger public safety or national security. 
None of the nine exemptions the Department of Homeland Security says it has from federal open records law appears to apply to the ICE contracts.
Geauga County can’t simply hide behind federal immigration officials to avoid its obligations under Ohio open-records law, said Amy Gilbert, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU.
“Tellingly, Geauga doesn’t dispute that it is withholding public records from disclosure,” she said in an email. “The county’s supposed reliance on ICE to tell it what to do does not relieve the county of this statutory duty. As a clear legal matter, their duty is governed by Ohio law.”

Meanwhile, the lawfulness of ICE’s conduct has been called into question elsewhere in Ohio — and across the country.
ICE officers — some of them masked — on Tuesday handcuffed New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander when he asked to see the warrant they had to arrest a migrant who had appeared for a hearing at immigration court. 
The tactic in those and other courthouses has deprived migrants of a traditional safe space to engage with the legal system, critics say.
Federal agents last week took U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla to the ground and handcuffed him as he tried to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at a press conference. Noem, who has struggled to explain fundamental legal protections for individuals, oversees ICE.
In Butler County in Southwestern Ohio, supporters of Emerson Colindres had been demonstrating outside the jail against his ICE detention. Born in Honduras, Colindres, 19, had been living on Cincinnati’s West Side since he was eight.
On June 4, the recent high school graduate and soccer standout was arrested during a routine ICE check-in. CityBeat on Tuesday reported that ICE had moved Colindres to a private jail in Louisiana — even though his attorneys a day earlier had filed a motion to stop the deportation. 
In a written statement, Ohio Immigrant Alliance founder Lynn Tramonte said that if the goal of President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation program was to make people feel safer, it’s not working.
“No one benefits when masked ICE agents arrest immigrants at their immigration court hearings, while they are following the process,” she said. “When ICE tricks a high school soccer star into showing up for an appointment, and arrests him on the spot. That doesn’t help anyone at all.” 
Tramonte added, “Emerson Colindres has a U visa waiting for him. One branch of the federal government is processing it, while another branch of the same government is trying to deport him.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)Ohio House and Senate Republicans had finally agreed on a bill changing the state’s recreational marijuana policy, but hours before the vote was supposed to take place, it was pulled from the schedule.
Voters spoke loud and clear in November of 2023, with 57% of Ohioans voting yes on Issue 2: legalizing recreational marijuana.
“I voted for it,” state Rep. Jamie Callender (R-Concord), the House’s resident cannabis expert.
Callender has been smoking marijuana for decades and has been trying to reduce stigma around the product for just as long.
If you are 21 years old, you can smoke, vape, and ingest marijuana. Individually, you can grow six plants, but you can grow up to 12 plants per household if you live with others.
But since then, other Republican leaders have been trying to change the law.
For the past several months, the House and Senate chambers have been trying to compromise on their separate bills.
In short, the Senate’s proposal decreases THC content, reduces home growing from 12 plants to 6, imposes more criminal penalties and takes away tax money from local municipalities that have dispensaries. The House’s latest version had none of those.
Click here for Senate version and here for House version changes.
“The Senate had proposed taking that tax away, and the House has fought really hard to keep that in…” Callender said. “We finally had that negotiated so it would stay in.”

Recently, Callender told me an agreement was reached on following most of the House’s new version, which mainly focused on preventing children from accessing the drug. The bill was set to hit the House floor Wednesday.

But in a turn of events, Republican infighting is preventing the bill from being passed.
“Apparently, the Senate changed their mind,” Callender said.
In a shock to House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima), the Senate pulled out of the compromise.
“I’m pretty disappointed — we’re not going to have it on the floor today,” Huffman said. “To my surprise, there was a whole new set of issues, additional issues, which were raised Monday night by the Senate regarding what we were trying to do.”
It was a Senate push for 16 changes, ones that Huffman didn’t get to even see until the day before the vote was set to take place.
“They wanted to make a mandatory jail sentence for passing a joint between friends,” Callender said, referencing a provision on “sharing.”
The main holdup is the tax money, he added.
The law gives the 10% tax revenue from each marijuana sale to four different venues: 36% to the social equity fund, to help people disproportionately impacted by marijuana-related laws; 36% to host cities — ones that have dispensaries; 25% to the state’s mental health and addiction services department; and 3% to the state’s cannabis control department.
Instead, the Senate wants all the revenue from the tax to be sent to the state’s General Revenue Fund, meaning lawmakers can choose to allocate that money toward whatever they want.
The House, as Callender had mentioned, has a major sticking point with making sure that at least the local municipalities get at least some percentage of the tax revenue.
“What changed in the past 72 hours to pull the Senate out of the marijuana deal?” I asked Senate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon)
“Well, I wouldn’t say anything has changed; I think the conversations have gone pretty well on it,” McColley responded. “I think, maybe, there was a misunderstanding as to where we might have been on the bill as both chambers.”
The president wants to follow his version of the legislation.
“Our priorities are in the bill that we already passed,” he said.
The teams will work together to actually come to an agreement as soon as possible, he continued.
“I would like to get something done by the end of June; I think [Huffman] would like to get something done by the end of June,” McColley added. “We’ll see if we can get something done in the next week.”
Huffman said he’s “not very optimistic” about that.
“I just told my caucus: ‘We’re not going to just say, “OK,” because we’re so anxious to pass the marijuana bill,’ which I’d like to get it done, but we’re not going to give up house priorities to do that,” the speaker said.
Several hours later, Huffman responded to additional cannabis questions.
“I thought we were on a path, this time last week, to pass it [this week],” the speaker said. “That was the kind of clear indication we had.”
However, when I pointed out to Huffman how McColley denied their agreement, he switched gears.
“There was no agreement to pull out of,” he said.
I asked why he would put a bill on the floor if there wasn’t an agreement.
“We were hoping that there would be, anticipating there would be, sounded like we might have, but it’s not correct to say that there was an agreement that anybody pulled out of,” he said.
However, his cousin and the resident marijuana expert in the opposite chamber, state Sen. Steve Huffman (R-Tipp City), said there was. The senator had been the main negotiating party for that chamber.
“We were in an agreement,” S. Huffman said.
He continued that policy staff and McColley brought “ongoing concerns” to him, but he believes they could be easily fixed. An additional reason why it was pulled is due to drafting issues with the bill language, he added.
“I believe that things are still being worked out, and I have the utmost confidence that we will resolve this by next Wednesday,” the senator said.
Callender isn’t so sure about that.
“Do you believe that the Senate will be going against the will of the voters with all of their requests?” I asked him.
“Yes,” he said.
Callender said that this reminds him of the last General Assembly, when M. Huffman and former Speaker Jason Stephens (R-Kitts Hill) were squabbling constantly about everything, but especially marijuana.
Stephens and Callender prevented then-Senate President Huffman’s legislation from passing. Back in 2023-24, Huffman proposed a bill very similar to the Senate’s current version.
It appears that Huffman, with the House GOP, has shifted away from a more restrictive view to a position similar to the one Stephens held in the past.

But it doesn't tell the whole story. (Illustration by Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)For the past few weeks, my son has been on the East Coast at a summer camp with his friend, another Midwesterner. They have been meeting kids from all over the country — actually, all over the world. 
During a phone call the other night, he told us about the mock-horror that others displayed when they found out that he was from — of all places — Kansas. They were joking, but still …
“Do you ride horses to school?”
“Wait, you like shopping at Target? Do you have those in Kansas?”
“You must work in the cornfields, right?”
He has been a Sunflower State celebrity, although I am sure few of the kids know anything of our state flower. 
Ask people from elsewhere in the country what they know about Kansas. What you get back is often a reductive monoculture: agriculture, rural isolation and, yes, “The Wizard of Oz.”
The cultural fuel for these stereotypes includes books and movies, songs and TV shows — and the internet certainly contributes.
Largely built on the raw material of the internet, artificial intelligence has been fed blog posts, news stories, Wikipedia entries and worse. And if you consider Reddit posts and chat rooms as “intelligence,” you have an odd definition of intelligence. Artificial intelligence largely knows what we have already typed.
With all of this in mind, I went on an internet field trip this week to see what AI thinks about Kansas. Specifically, I was interested in seeing what visuals it creates about Kansas.
You might have seen something similar in your social media feeds: people prompting AI image generators to provide “The typical family from Wisconsin” or “The most stereotypical couples in each state according to AI.” Many of the AI images were filled with hallucinations, such as an impossible M.C. Escher-esque picnic table and puzzling limbs. 
Asking different AI models about Kansas showed how single minded the internet is about our state. To ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot, I asked: “Please create a photorealistic illustration that shows the most Kansas family ever.” 
(Kansas Reflector doesn’t publish work created by artificial intelligence, a limit that I understand. So, that’s why the images aren’t included here. However, I bet each model would regurgitate something along these lines with the same instructions.)
The three images were disturbingly similar: each with a quartet of mom, dad, son and daughter. The figures were all white, including a crowd of dozens in the background of the ChatGPT image. The dads were rocking denim and, most often, hats with blurry John Deere logos. The moms carried freshly baked pies or a picnic basket as they smiled at the nonexistent camera. The kids? Wearing replicas of overalls, a Kansas City Chiefs jersey or T-shirts from Kansas State University or the University of Kansas. 
In the backgrounds, agriculture for miles. 
Some questions: 

ChatGPT: Why is there a four-foot-tall version of the John Deere patriarch standing right next to the other, normally sized John Deere patriarch?
Copilot and ChatGPT: Where are you shopping that allows you to find so many sunflower-patterned dresses? 
Gemini: Why are we lighting a grill in the middle of a sunflower field? 
And to all of them: Is everyone white in Kansas? 

Certainly, everyone is attractive in the AI version of Kansas. The surroundings are idyllic — except for the tornado looming in ChatGPT’s version of Kansas. (Why does everyone in the crowd seem so calm?)
These visual mix-ups and cultural uniformity about Kansas might seem pretty innocent. Asking an AI model to imagine Kansas is going to invite pick-up trucks, farms, Jayhawks, golden retrievers and BBQ-spatula-wielding dads. These images are pretty harmless. They’re only as deceptive as their reinforcement of stereotypes about what is normal in Kansas. 
What I found more corrosive and dangerous was asking an image database, Adobe Stock, to provide images from the state. When searching the image collection, you can choose photographic images from real human photographers. Or you can select “Generative AI Only.”
What a difference a click makes. 
When you exclude generative AI from your search, you see stock images of Kansas: weather vanes standing along barbed wire fences, windmills at sunset and yes, tornadoes. It’s a limited view of the state, but accurate. 
When you review a grid of AI images though, it’s delusional Kansas. 
Behold the database’s “Aerial View of Lawrence: A Vibrant Summer Town in Eastern Kansas from Above.” Except it is not. Generated with AI, it’s an image that resembles Lawrence with evening sun illuminating low-slung office buildings and patchy farmland in the distance. But the geography and architecture have been disturbingly scrambled to create Bizarro-Lawrence. 
For Topeka, another image in the database has created a wide tree-lined path cutting right through town and becoming a main boulevard slicing right through town. That doesn’t exist. 
Another artist created “Ruined Cityscape of Topeka, Kansas: A Tragic Urban Landscape.” The image looks like a more grand and architecturally re-imagined Topeka High School in shambles. Thankfully, the image leans more toward illustration than photograph, so few people are likely to be deceived. 
Most confusing is an image titled “Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site.” It isn’t. The actual Topeka historical site was converted from Monroe Middle School, a two-story brick and stone building with a tile roof. The AI image showcases a magnificent modern monument, all windows and right angles. Who made this AI version? An artist who appropriately calls themselves “Lalaland.”
How are we to be warned away from using this image? Adobe provides this text: “Generated with AI. Editorial use must not be misleading or deceptive.” How could this image be used in a non-deceptive way?
The image collection also provides a map of Kansas — one that seems to have been made by a drunk cartographer. The outline of the state is accurate: the rectangle of Kansas with a bite out of the northeast corner. The map appears to be vintage-ish, as though printed on antique paper. 
But what is the deal with the curving lines that carve up the state? Are those cities? No. Are those counties? No. Just aimless and meaningless boundaries. They are the misleading vagaries of an AI model. 
And what is the U-shaped line swerving through the state? A wayward river? An imagined highway? Nope. Just an AI hallucination.
It’s like this everywhere that AI images live these days. 
The images paint Kansans as pie-baking, white, rural, attractive caricatures. And artists are submitting images to stock agencies, redefining our state’s cities and historic landmarks.
While one AI image might not destroy the truth on its own, they conspire as a group to make us doubt our eyes. We are forced to read the fine print for disclosures. We must do reverse image searches to see if the image exists elsewhere. We must zoom on our devices, pinching and squinting at limbs to see if they are distorted. 
In 1995, I played with Photoshop, the image manipulation tool, for the first time. I saw the power of rearranging pixels to tell a different story. I wrote an earnest philosophy paper about the power of lying through digital manipulation. Since then, I have spent many hours teaching students how to use that digital power ethically.
That 1995 version of Photoshop is nothing next to our 2025 apps that create AI images. Artificial intelligence requires less time, less creativity and little training. And yet the images are more likely to deceive.
With apologies to you, dear Kansas reader, I must say it: “Toto, I’ve a feeling we’re not in 1995 anymore.”

The Trump administration is implementing an executive order that includes removing certain historical documents, portraits and monuments from national museums and federal properties while replacing or restoring others in public spaces.
In March, President Trump signed an executive order under the guise of “restoring truth and sanity to American history by revitalizing key cultural institutions and reversing the spread of divisive ideology.”
In fact, the very opposite is true.
Instead, the executive order is an attempt to erase the factual experiences, treatment and contributions of Blacks, women and others by removing documents and other evidence from the nation’s museums and institutions.
Also, it’s purpose is to revive and glorify military leaders that led the fight to continue the oppression and disenfranchisement of Blacks.
This week as we celebrate Juneteenth  — a federal holiday commemorating the emancipation of Blacks from slavery — it is a good time to reflect on what the removal, and now the impending restoration, of Confederate monuments will or will not mean for our everyday lives.
The removal of some of the Confederate monuments in recent years has not made a difference in making things better:
In closing the great racial divide that is on display all across America. Bigotry, racism, prejudices, disenfranchisement of groups of people based strictly on skin color and economic station in life are still an ugly part of America.
In changing how Blacks are perceived and denied in the workplace.
In stopping how Blacks are treated by police and the criminal justice system, being stopped more often than whites with or without a legitimate reason, and receiving longer and harsher sentences and judgements than whites for the same or lesser offenses. This is commonplace in towns and cities across America.
In eliminating the perpetual education achievement gap where Black children are still locked in poorer inferior schools, where in racially integrated schools they are disciplined and expelled at much higher rates than white children for the same behavior and infractions.
More importantly, removal of Confederate monuments has not erased the ugly history of America they represent.
The bane of racist evilness that still remains is seen in the resurgence and boldness of white supremacy and blatant expressions of racial hatred.
So, what is the priority and purpose of the resurgence to recognize, honor and regale us in such an ugly and destructive time in American history by our president and his administration?
With an administration where so much of what is done with “made for TV” drama and flair, renaming and restoring visible symbols of an inglorious past under the guise of American gallantry is one more act taking center stage.
Displaying and honoring the vestiges of that period in public squares and other public spaces of southern cities, towns and state capitals only serve to make a statement that this part of American history is laudable and something to be proud of.
Proud of the horrible deeds of those men, and the lasting destructive attitudes, laws, and practices that resulted from them.
The resulting Civil War threatened the very existence of this country. What is the purpose of waving the confederate flag instead of or alongside the American flag?
It is long past time that America’s confederate history takes it rightful place within the walls of a national museum or several museums.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The long-standing and appropriate practice has been that American history is preserved in national and local museums where it is accessible to anyone who would like to revisit our past, visit it for the first time, or learn anew the real facts.
The Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest museum, educational and research complex, opened the National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2016. It is being targeted by the Trump administration.
Confederate statutes of generals, documents and other memorabilia belong in museums and designated parks to remind all Americans of a period in this nation’s history that was detrimental, inhumane, ugly and which should never be repeated.
Those reminders need not be destroyed or revered.
As the executive order to purge the collections and displays of historical accounts housed in some of our great museums and institutions is being caried out, will these reminders be recast, white-washed and honored?
The goal should not be to destroy history, but to learn from it.
Isn’t it enough to have lingering vestiges of racial conflict, inequality and oppression prevalent today and still affecting the quality of everyday lives?
It is progress to acknowledge that any period of human enslavement, oppression, servitude, and persecution in a country’s history is, indeed, a shameful and inglorious one.
To deny, disown or ignore it is not only crippling, but defeating.
There is a lot to be concerned about when it comes to these insidious efforts to rewrite the history of America.
We need to make concerted efforts to preserve the facts, major periods and their impact, and to make that information available to future generations.
Future generations need to know the complete American history — the good, the bad, to build a promising future.
Sadly, many American who regale in those times and symbols will likely continue to do so in their hearts and minds.
It begs the question why would any decent, compassionate, ethical, if not God-fearing, person want to honor and revel in such a time with visible, larger than life, reminders.
Only facing this scourge, confronting it, and actively taking the necessary steps to make things better will have lasting meaning.
Sadly, even then, there will be those who will stay stuck in the false sense of racial superiority that is merely a relic of America’s past.
Yes, Confederate flags and monuments are historical relics that too many are trying to preserve not because of their place in America’s history, but in an attempt to determine America’s future.
The president and his administration are leading the charge.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderIt’s easy to get discouraged or cynical about the state of American political life. Our reservoirs of civic trust have been drained dry. We’ve lost faith in each other, respect for each other, and too often those seeking popularity and power do so by appealing to the worst in us rather than the best. Too often, they have succeeded. 
We’ve allowed compromise – the essential bedrock of any democracy – to become discredited as a bad thing, as a sign of weakness in an era when, for many, dominance is the preferred outcome.  Our system of government was designed to frustrate such dominance, but at the moment its ability to perform that mission seems questionable. 
As a result, the possibility of violence lays like a shroud upon the land.
But last weekend, for the first time in a while, I felt faith refreshed. In Atlanta, Savannah, Marietta, Athens, Macon, Columbus and other Georgia cities, large and small, tens of thousands of people turned out in protest against the excesses of their government, joining millions of their fellow Americans in protest all around the country, in big cities, country towns and suburbs.
Anger and fear will find expression, if not in one outlet then in another. The organizers of the massive “No Kings” protests provided an outlet that was peaceful and purposeful. They gave a voice, a stage, for citizens who are appalled by the cruelty, illegality and corruption of our political institutions, but who until now felt helpless to take action. What they achieved over the weekend called upon the best of America, in the nonviolent tradition championed by the best of Atlanta, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lewis.
Good trouble, and I loved to see it.
The “No Kings” organizers and those millions who heeded their call did not trample the Constitution or pay it hypocritical lip service. To the contrary, they deployed it. Freedom of speech, the freedom to assemble, the freedom to petition government for redress of grievances, all are rights guaranteed us by the Constitution. The exercise of those rights, in turn, are essential to ensuring that the Constitution survives, that these rights are retained for those who come after us.
From what I can tell, none of the thousands of “No Kings” protests last weekend resulted in violence by protesters, which was critical to their success. The sporadic violence that did occur came from those who were intent on trying to disrupt the mass protest, probably because they feared what it might accomplish.
Of course, neither the protests nor the protesters have actual power to enact or force change. Those who marched hold no office; they have no vote in Congress. They control no divisions of troops and cannot make or enforce laws. But what they can do, what they have begun to do, is to demonstrate to those who do hold power that the people are watching them, that the people have the courage to act when supposed leaders quake and quail.
In his famous “I Have A Dream” speech in 1963, Dr. King warned his followers that however valid their demands might be, their struggle must be conducted “on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence.”
“We cannot walk alone,” he said. “And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back.”

Is it their principles and the policies they believe will best serve their community? Or is it the approval of party leadership?
That’s the question at the heart of a case recently revived by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in favor of the Catoosa County GOP in a 2024 challenge to the ballot access of four Republican candidates.
The recent ruling sends the case back to the district court and comes on the heels of the state GOP convention, where delegates passed a resolution seeking to bar Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger from qualifying to run for any office as a Republican.
Raffensperger, who won another term as the state’s top election official in 2022, is seen as a potential candidate for higher office in 2026. But some Republicans dislike him for his refusal to cooperate with President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia and over the state’s use of voting machines over paper ballots.
Josh McKoon, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, told reporters at the convention he didn’t see a way within state law to keep Raffensperger from qualifying.
But the Georgia Republican Assembly, a group that seeks to make the state party more conservative, said in an email to supporters that the ruling underscores McKoon’s “legal right and responsibility to enforce the resolution passed at the state convention” keeping Raffensperger off the ballot.
McKoon could not be reached for comment this week.
‘It’s a matter of rights for the voters’
The case involves four candidates who ran for the county commission last year, all either incumbents or former members. Incumbent Jeff Long and Chairman Steven Henry won their seats, while incumbent commissioners Vanita Hullander and Larry Black both lost in GOP primary runoffs.
The county party said the four should not be able to run as Republicans because local party leaders said the candidates did not share their values and policy prescriptions.
When asked via email what the candidates did, GRA President Nathaniel Darnell referred the Recorder to a 2024 statement and video outlining votes and stances he said do not comply with conservative principles, including on taxes, COVID-19 vaccine mandates, regulations on backyard chickens and the endorsement of a Democratic candidate.
In a statement posted to social media, Henry said the matter could have major ramifications for who can and can’t run for office.
“Ballot access is not just a matter of fairness for the candidate – it’s a matter of rights for the voters,” the commission chairman wrote. “Each citizen has the right to support and vote for the candidate of their choice. If candidates are removed from the ballot, it effectively silences the voices of those who support them.”
Henry said the assembly’s favored candidate who opposed him only got around a quarter of the vote in the primary but could have been elected to county chair if he had been barred from the group had their way, which he said would have silenced the majority of Catoosa County Republican voters.
“Upholding open access to the ballot protects the voices of the people and reinforces the core democratic value that government is by the people and for the people,” he said.
Legal battles
The four sued in Catoosa County Superior Court, which issued an order requiring the county party to allow them to qualify.
The Catoosa County GOP refused to comply, and on March 8, 2024, the final day to qualify, the court issued an order directing the board of elections to circumvent the party and qualify the candidates as Republicans for the primary.
The county party and its chair, Joanna Hildreth, sued at the state and federal level. Hildreth is also secretary of the Georgia Republican Assembly.
As a work-around, the county party proposed ballot questions that would have notified primary voters that the county party did not support the four:
“1. Do you think anti-Trump Democrats should be able to get a court order to force the elections board to qualify them as Republican candidates for office?

Did you know that Steven Henry, Vanita Hullander, Jeff Long, and Larry Black were not approved to run as Republicans by the Republican Party?”

In an email to the Catoosa GOP, Raffensperger’s office said the “Secretary of State cannot
publish party questions on the ballot that contain the names of candidates or commentary regarding those candidates, as that constitutes unlawful electioneering.”
Whether that is true under state law will also be under question when the case returns to the lower court.
Last year, the state Supreme Court dismissed the county GOP’s appeal and declined to weigh in on the underlying issue, whether local parties should be able to determine who can and cannot run under that party’s banner in elections.
In a separate lawsuit in federal court, U. S. District Judge William Ray II seemed to indicate that they cannot in his ruling against the party.
“Trying to limit who can run in a primary seems inconsistent with the purpose of a primary to start with,” he wrote. “Perhaps the Catoosa Republican Party doesn’t believe that the citizens of Catoosa County can for themselves intelligently decide which candidates best embody the principles of the Republican Party. The Court does not share such sentiment. It seems that our form of government is designed to allow citizens to pick their government leaders, not for insiders (of the local party) to pick the government leaders for them.”
But the 11th Circuit found that Ray was in error. In its ruling, the court cited a 1992 decision keeping Louisiana white supremacist presidential candidate David Duke off of the Republican ballot in Georgia.
“We noted that Supreme Court precedent recognized ‘the legitimacy of a political party’s exclusion of a candidate in the party primary in order to protect itself from those with adverse political principles,’” the ruling reads. “And we concluded that the party’s right to freedom of association ‘encompasses its decision to exclude Duke as a candidate on the Republican Primary ballot because Duke’s political beliefs are inconsistent with those of the Republican Party.’ Here, Plaintiffs have established an actual, particularized, and concrete burden on their freedom of association.”
Darnell celebrated the ruling in a statement.
“We felt confident this would eventually happen as the case made its way up the ladder in the federal appeals process because SCOTUS precedent on this subject is so clearly favorable to the Catoosa GOP’s position,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-20 04:01:22+00:00,CT Mirror,CT HB 5002 – a more nuanced take,Michael Chuchev,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/20/ct-hb-5002-a-more-nuanced-take/,Opponents don't  appreciate the insurmountable barrier local governments can pose to new construction. Supporters gloss over the introduction of central planning.,"On the third of this month, our state legislature passed HB 5002, the omnibus housing bill known as “Work, Live, Ride.”  Supporters contend that the bill is a necessary step towards addressing our state’s dearth of “affordable” housing, while opponents decry the bill’s cracking down of local zoning restrictions.
However, both sides miss the mark here.  Opponents to the bill do not fully appreciate the insurmountable barrier that local governments often pose to new construction, while supporters gloss over the bill’s introduction of central planning.  Therefore, I give a more nuanced summary of the bill, which hopefully provides a fuller consideration of the matter.
First, the bill restrains some of the worst excesses of municipal zoning.  Parking minimums, for example, waste land, drive up rents, and greatly increase construction costs.  The bill limits these to the extent necessary to avoid “a specific adverse impact on public health and safety,” thus making future housing cheaper to build and thus more affordable.  Furthermore, it also allows smaller lots to be used for rental units.
Likewise, with the advent of remote work, zoning restrictions have forced landlords to maintain vacant office buildings at great personal expense.  By allowing as-of-right conversion of commercial lots to middle housing (duplexes, triplexes, and the like), the bill helps lower rents by putting more units on the market.
Finally, state law currently allows existing residents to block zoning changes by complaining to the zoning board.  The bill raises the minimum proportion of affected property owners required to mount a challenge to a zoning change from 20 percent to 50 and also allows a simple majority of the board to disregard the challenge, thus preventing a NIMBY minority from holding veto power over new housing.
Another beneficial part of the bill is granting “transit-oriented districts” additional state funding, provided that they allow as-of-right development of middle housing and affordable apartment complexes. In an increasingly urban state, tying increased funding to zoning liberalization and alleviating car traffic is a great way to both lower rents and improve the quality of life for our state’s numerous city-dwellers.
Altogether, “Work, Live, Ride” takes many excellent steps towards increasing housing supply: it removes the worst barriers to new construction; it allows owners of vacant commercial lots to remodel and eventually rent them out to residential tenants; it rewards cities for facilitating the construction of new apartment buildings and even makes it easier for the residents of these buildings to get around. That makes it all the more tragic that the salutary effect of the aforementioned provisions is greatly handicapped by the pervasive spirit of state intervention in the economy.
For the most part, central planning manifests itself in “Work, Live, Ride” by the restriction of many of its protections, such as municipal plans to ease zoning regulations, to affordable housing.  This gives municipalities leeway to ban virtually all market-rate developments, so long as they permit sub-market ones.  There are two problems here: first, affordable housing, although it comes with all the risks and costs of market-rate housing, has rents so low that these risks and costs are often not worth it for investors.  Therefore, very little affordable housing will actually be built.  Second, the market-rate will remain high enough that individuals who could afford it will choose to live elsewhere, thus depriving our already-impoverished cities of much-needed jobs and tax dollars.
For the same reason, the legislature should have done away with the requirement that 30 percent of new units in apartment complexes in transit-oriented districts be affordable.  Not only does it discourage new housing, but it even leads developers to build luxury units in order to recoup their losses, thus resulting in a commensurate increase in rents.
Finally, the bill assigns a “fair share” of affordable units which each municipality is required to accommodate based on how many the Hartford bureaucrats decide are “needed.”  Once again, limiting this provision to affordable housing comes with all of the harms mentioned above.  In addition, market forces (a fancy term for our collective wants and the means to supply them) will ultimately dictate what kind, where, and how much housing gets built.  The state can set whatever goals it wants, but developers are under no obligation to meet them.
The facts of the matter being laid out, I have the following recommendations: first, Gov. Ned Lamont should call a special session of the legislature, as has been suggested.  There, the legislators should extend the bill’s protections to all housing and replace the “fair share” quotas with a general requirement that municipalities provide a friendly environment for new housing. 
Finally, instead of trying to manage the poor by requiring more affordable housing, legislators should focus on increasing economic opportunity for all our residents, so that they may be able to afford the market rate themselves.

Juneteenth recognizes the day that enslaved people gained freedom in Texas more than two years after the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation. On June 19, 1865, Union troops in Galveston Bay, Texas announced the decree that liberated more than 250,000 enslaved people.
The Rondo Center of Diverse Expression held its fifth annual Juneteenth celebration in St. Paul’s historically Black neighborhood of Rondo. More than 600 Black families lost their homes and many more were displaced  during the construction of Interstate 94 in the 1950s and 1960s. The neighborhood has persevered, however, and one of its own is mayor.

“My name is Melvin Carter. My job is ‘mayor,’ but my identity is Rondo. Because I’m from this neighborhood. This is the neighborhood that raised me,” Carter said during his remarks. “I remember driving on I-94, my dad would say, ‘You’re in my bedroom right now.’”
Carter also spoke about the evolution of Rondo and Juneteenth. Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021 and a Minnesota state holiday in 2023. The celebration took place at an intersection of Rondo Avenue, which was renamed from Concordia Avenue in 2024.

“We make it a point to come out to Juneteenth celebration every year,” Averie Mitchell-Brown, a member of the collective, told the Reformer.
Mitchell-Brown spoke about how Juneteenth has grown over time.
“One thing that I’ve noticed is that Juneteenth has just gotten to evolve into just seeing a lot more Black-owned businesses. Which is cool because way back, we couldn’t find it. We had to pick and choose, or just look around on social media and really search for Black-owned businesses, especially locally-owned,” Mitchell-Brown said.

President Trump had a legitimate interest in protecting federal employees when he deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles, an appeals court ruled.


Donald Trump can continue to control the National Guard in California for the time being after a panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals determined he followed the law in deploying troops to Los Angeles.The order is the latest in a fast-moving legal saga playing out over Trump’s decision to call up the National Guard and U.S. Marines to the Los Angeles area in response to protests after federal immigration law enforcement agents began worksite raids and arrests two weeks ago. California’s Democratic leadership, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, has called the deployment unnecessary and illegal.Their order in a lawsuit filed by Newsom contesting the deployment isn’t surprising; the panel signaled an openness to the Trump administration’s legal arguments during a legal hearing on Tuesday.
In court earlier this week, attorneys from the Trump administration argued the president’s deployment was “unreviewable” by courts. 
The appeals court judges disagreed that the decision was beyond the reach of the judicial branch, but found the president had a legitimate interest in protecting federal employees when he called up the troops. 
“The undisputed facts demonstrate that before the deployment of the National Guard, protesters ‘pinned down’ several federal officers and threw ‘concrete chunks, bottles of liquid and other objects’ at the officers.”Two of those judges were appointed by President Trump in his previous term.
What happens next could take one of several turns. On Friday a lower court judge, Charles Breyer, will hold a hearing on whether to again return the troops to Newsom through a preliminary injunction.Trump deployed the troops through a presidential memo on June 7 and cited a rarely used federal statute permitting a president to deploy the National Guard in times of invasion, domestic rebellion or the inability for the federal government to carry out its laws. Trump’s order was for 60 days and technically applied to all of the state Nation Guards in the U.S.Basically, the battle over whether federal troops can remain in Los Angeles is operating on three parallel tracks — the temporary restraining order from last week, Friday’s hearing and the full merits of the case through a prolonged trial. Technically, the government lawyers for Trump and Newsom can ask for appeals on all three tracks.
For Newsom’s legal team to prevail in Friday’s hearing, they’ll have to clear a higher threshold of scrutiny than they did when they initially won back the National Guard last week, albeit for a few hours. That’s because anyone seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate that the merits of their arguments will likely prevail in the full trial.
The appeals court’s decision could influence Breyer’s thinking, legal thinkers said, even if he initially signalled support for the Newsom administration’s arguments.“it’s kind of hard to disentangle the two processes when we think about how judge Breyer will be weighing” the preliminary injunction hearing,” because a lot of that’s going to be informed by what these higher level courts decide,” said Christopher Mirasola, an assistant law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.
No matter what Breyer does after Friday, it’ll likely quickly go back to the appeals court. And if the appeals court keeps halting the lower court’s orders, Trump keeps the National Guard for the duration of the lower court’s full trial.
Would the Newsom team try to appeal the injunction with the Supreme Court?
On one hand, “why not shoot your shot when you got the opportunity, right?” asked Mirasola rhetorically.  But there’s a chance the high court comes back with such a strong opinion favoring the Trump administration that it could “substantively affect how judge Breyer treats the merits of the case.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-SEIU-ICE-Protest-TS-29.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-19 22:59:39.109519

Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Wanda Stokes also addressed the crowd, elaborating on the importance of Juneteenth as an American holiday.
“The significance of Juneteenth extends far beyond its historical roots,” Stokes explained. “It’s a celebration of resilience, hope, and an unwavering pursuit of justice by generations of Black Americans.”
Furthermore, Stokes added, Juneteenth is a reminder that the pursuit of justice is still ongoing.
“Together, we can transform the promise of freedom into lasting change, ensuring that the spirit of Juneteenth lives in our spirits and in our hearts.”

(Carnegie Mellon University photo)Edda Fields-Black was working on a book about rice plantations when she came across the story of a raid in Beaufort that freed more than 700 slaves from Lowcountry plantations.
The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.
She tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad.
So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
Harriet Tubman
Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.

“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
Finding the story
As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands who drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)At the University of Alaska Anchorage, we understand the health of our communities depends on the strength of our workforce. As Alaska’s flagship institution for health education, UAA’s College of Health is not only preparing students for high-demand careers — it is transforming lives and strengthening communities across the state. 
Nowhere is this impact more evident than in the College of Health School of Nursing. Between 2013 and 2023, the School of Nursing educated more than 2,750 graduates, with greater than 85% of them employed in Alaska within their first year of graduation. UAA nurses currently serve in communities from Anchorage to the most remote corners of Alaska, and are the backbone of health care delivery in our state. These professionals are not just filling jobs — they are answering a call to care for their neighbors, often in the very communities where they were raised. Their journey began at UAA, and their impact is felt every day. 
In 2024, we had 458 students enrolled across our nursing programs: Associate of Applied Science in Nursing, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Science in Nursing and Doctorate in Nursing Practice. This year, enrollment remains strong, with over 450 students continuing their journey toward becoming health care professionals. In that same year, we proudly awarded 82 A.A.S., 122 B.S. and 18 M.S. nursing degrees, demonstrating our ongoing contribution to Alaska’s nursing workforce. 
A key strength of our nursing programs is their hybrid delivery model that allows instruction to occur from a distance and locally with clinical partners. This approach supports student success and strengthens health care systems in rural and underserved areas by training professional nurses already rooted in those communities. 
UAA’s health programs offer over 50 degree and certificate options, ranging from short-term credentials to doctoral degrees. Our focus is clear: educate Alaskans in Alaska for Alaska. This mission is especially critical as we face ongoing workforce shortages in health care. Each year, nearly 1,000 students graduate from UAA’s health programs ready to step into roles that are vital to the well-being of our state. These students are not just pursuing a degree — they are building futures rooted in service, community and purpose. 
The success of our nationally accredited nursing programs is grounded in our commitment to excellence, affordability and accessibility. Through strategic partnerships with health care providers, nonprofits and tribal organizations, we ensure our students receive hands-on clinical training and real-world experience. These collaborations not only enhance education but also build a pipeline of skilled professionals who are ready to serve. It’s a model that reflects our belief in the power of community and the importance of investing in local talent. 
We are also investing in the future. The UAA Health Workforce Expansion and Diversity Project is creating a state-of-the-art simulation and training facility to double the number of graduates in key allied health fields. Starting as early as high school, through initiatives like the Alaska Area Health Education Centers and the Della Keats Program, we are inspiring the next generation of health care professionals. 
As provost, I am proud of the transformative work happening at UAA’s College of Health. Our graduates are more than health care workers, they are leaders, advocates and changemakers. Their journey through UAA equips them to serve their communities with compassion and skill and their impact resonates across Alaska. 
At UAA, we believe in the power of education to shape lives and uplift communities. We stand by our commitment: Your Journey. Your Community. Your Impact. Let us continue to support and invest in the programs that keep our communities healthy and our future bright.

Families and community members gathered in Central Park for a day of live entertainment and education centered around “unity in the community.”
“Juneteenth gives an opportunity for us to celebrate the holiday, to celebrate the achievements of Black Americans, ” said Rachelle Chase, an Ottumwa author and one of four organizers for her city’s Juneteenth celebration. “That’s the one time, the one holiday where the spotlight is on that.”

In 2020, Chase noticed a local theater troupe was hosting a weeklong Juneteenth event. She recognized the attention the Black community was getting in the wake of George Floyd’s murder and decided to partner with local Pastor Diana Koger, Joe Koger and Dr. Jeff Hendred to organize a local celebration.
Ever since, the Ottumwa community has joined in the long-standing tradition of Juneteenth, which began as early as 1866. Many historians place the first celebration of what was then called “Jubilee Day” to Galveston, Texas, where many gathered to celebrate the first anniversary of the emancipation. It officially became a national holiday in 2021.
“It’s imperative that we, especially in the times we are in right now, take a moment to recognize and commemorate our history. The truth of our history,” said Dana James, founder and publisher of Black Iowa News. “The truth of this country begins its history of enslavement. Why wouldn’t we commemorate the end of that?”
James is the founder of a digital news platform dedicated to showcasing the Black community and amplifying the voices of Black Iowans. Her paper held one of several booths around the park promoting community resources such as the Ottumwa Human Rights Commission, several Black-owned businesses such as 5 Star Graphic Design, and many others.

At 1 p.m., families gathered in a shaded corner of Central Park for Eulenspiegel Puppet Theater Company’s performance of “Remembering Buxton,” based on Chase’s book “Creating the Black Utopia of Buxton, Iowa.” Her book tells the story of an unincorporated coal mining town, established in 1900, where the Consolidation Coal Mining Company provided miners with equal housing and pay, regardless of race. 
“It was a complete anomaly for its time because it was a 100% egalitarian town,” said Monica Leo, managing director and lead puppeteer for Eulenspiegel. “It only existed for 25 years because the coal mine played out.”
Leo said she was “inspired by that story and wanted to do something with it,” so she reached out to Chase and the two collaborated in interpreting the story of Buxton as a puppet show. Recognizing a need for live music, they reached out to Des Moines musician Dartanyan Brown who wrote and performs the music for the story of Buxton.

Leo and Brown have performed in shows together since the 1970s, when the two worked as part of the Des Moines Art Collective, a travelling art group that performed in towns with populations less than 5000. 
Brown said festivals like Juneteenth are important because they “give people a sense that they, their heritage, their culture and their history are relevant to the entire American picture.”
James added: “Black Americans helped make this country what it is and you can’t tell the story of this country without telling the stories of Black Americans, they’re right in the center of it.”

They crossed the Ohio River to Ripley, Ohio, made their way to freedom in Canada and later crossed back over the border to settle in Boston. There they helped lead the abolitionist movement, provided refuge to other freedom-seekers on the Underground Railroad and became renowned patrons of education.
On Thursday, the Haydens returned to Lexington — in bronze, at least, as several hundred people gathered on a steamy Juneteenth morning for the dedication of “Towards Freedom,” a monumental depiction of the couple by Jamaican sculptor Basil Watson.
The unveiling comes after years of imagining and work by volunteers and neighbors of the statue’s North Limestone site, near where the Haydens would have begun their escape from enslavement.
And it comes as historians and educators warn of efforts by the Trump administration and others to sanitize racism and remove Black history from view, an effort alluded to by keynote speaker Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear.
“We cannot ignore the mistakes of our past,” Beshear told the gathering. “We cannot turn away from even the most painful moments and pretend they don’t exist. Instead, we must learn from them and make progress for that better tomorrow. And that’s what we’re doing right here today.
“While our federal government tries to erase a lot of our history, today in Kentucky we’re celebrating it. We are celebrating it and committing to preserving important people like Lewis and Harriet.”
The statue of the Haydens is on the grounds of Lexington Traditional Magnet School. As a choir sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” students helped Beshear and sculptor Watson unwrap and reveal the monument, a man and woman, facing north, their clasped hands raised to the sky.

Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton  said the city’s Public Arts Commission had made its largest contribution ever — $245,000 — to the sculpture.
Larry Kezele, a founder of Lexington Freedom Train, which is raising money for the statue, a park to surround it and also to organize educational events and curriculum, said more than $600,000 has been raised; he said the goal is $875,000. Kezele thanked LexArts for its help. “I want to thank every single person who has supported this project. Hundreds of people have contributed through donations, time, ideas and passion,” Kezele said.
Mark Steven Watkins, a member of the Freedom Train committee and father of an 11-year-old son, told the Haydens’ story, including that when Lewis decided to leave the slave state of Kentucky he had already lost his family twice to slavery.

Hayden had been traded away from his birth family as a child, and later his first wife and their child “were sold down the Mississippi River and he never saw them again, never heard from them again,” said Watkins.
“That would have broken me. It would have destroyed me. But Lewis Hayden kept going towards freedom.”
Watkins said Lewis was determined not to lose Harriet and her son, Joseph, when they became a family.
A ministry student from Oberlin College, Calvin Fairbank, and Lexington school teacher Delia Webster helped the Haydens and Joseph escape and were imprisoned by Kentucky for their courage.
Joseph died in the Civil War, Watkins said.
In Boston, Lewis ran a clothing store and was elected to the Massachusetts legislature.
As a widow, Harriet left her estate to the Harvard Medical School to educate Black Students, a legacy that is educating  students still. 
Kezele told the gathering, “The energy we feel now, the spirit in the air, is the presence of Lewis and Harriet Hayden, the abolitionists who aided them and the countless formerly enslaved from Lexington, whose voices have waited about two centuries to be heard.”

With unusually high heat expected early next week across Vermont, health and weather experts are advising people to stay cool.

Vermont is in for a stretch of intense summer weather, with forecasters warning of heat, humidity and potential thunderstorms.
The National Weather Service is expecting potentially hazardous weather for the state through Wednesday. Seth Kutikoff, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Burlington, said temperatures are projected to reach the mid- and upper 80s. Thunderstorms are expected in the afternoon and evening that will help bring down the temperature on Friday, but hot weather is expected to return this weekend.
“The risk today of damaging wind with the strongest thunderstorms: we want people to pay attention to any severe thunderstorm warnings that may be issued,” Kutikoff said. 
People can sign up with VT- Alert for updates related to weather, roads, or emergencies.
Kutikoff said Friday’s temperatures will be much lower, with widespread west wind, whereas weekend temperatures will be moderate with a risk of severe thunderstorms, particularly on Saturday night.
Meteorologists expect high temperatures to continue into next week. 
“This is the time of year that it’s common, but at the same time, the degree of heat that we’re expecting early next week is unusual,” said Kutikoff, adding that the forecast for Burlington is projected to be around 97 degrees.
“The temperature of 97 degrees would tie for the second warmest June temperature over the last 30 years,” Kutikoff said.
The heat will affect the entire state, with the Champlain Valley, Winooski Valley, and other areas with towns at lower elevations experiencing higher temperatures.
Kutikoff advised people to be prepared for the heat, finding cooling centers if needed and avoiding activities during the hottest parts of the day, especially on Monday and Tuesday.
Jared Ulmer, climate and health program manager at the Vermont Department of Health, said the cooling centers map will also be updated — likely the day before extreme heat is expected to hit — with additional resources highlighted on the map. Cooling centers at some libraries and fire stations will be open to the public, providing relief from the heat for people experiencing homelessness and without access to air conditioning. 
According to the latest state air conditioning data report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Vermont has the fifth lowest rate of air conditioning in the U.S., with 67% of homes equipped with air conditioning. Of those, 60% have single-room air conditioning units and only 7% have central air — the lowest number in the country after Alaska.
“Heat is a growing concern in Vermont and will continue to be more of a concern into the future,” Ulmer said.
As human activities drive climate change and lead to higher global temperatures, heat-related risks in Vermont are increasing as well, according to the Vermont Climate Assessment. The 2021 study found that “Vermont already is seeing more heat stroke and dehydration from high temperatures and an associated increase in heat-related (emergency department) visits since 2003.”
According to a hot weather preparedness guidance by the Vermont Department of Health, the number of people who visit the emergency room or call 911 for heat-related illnesses is similar to the number of people doing so for cold-related illnesses.
The Department of Health has also compiled a list of heat safety tips available in different languages and specific guidance for caregivers. 
“We’ve done a lot of work just trying to raise awareness about the health impacts of heat, recognizing symptoms, how to prepare and respond, because it really is just a new topic for a lot of people in Vermont to grapple with,” Ulmer said.

Approximately 42,000 people rallied around the state, with 16,500 in Burlington alone, according to 50501 Vermont organizers.

An estimated 42,000 Vermonters attended last weekend’s No Kings Day protests, organizers said, making it one of the biggest one-day demonstrations in state history. 
Vermonters turned out on Saturday to demonstrate against President Donald Trump on the same day he hosted a military parade in honor of Flag Day and the military’s 250th anniversary, coinciding with his own 79th birthday. Millions of people attended protests nationwide, and some experts believe that it may have been the largest single-day demonstration in U.S. history. 
Debbie Peel from 50501 Vermont, the group that organized the protests in the state, provided attendance tallies from local organizers of the more than 50 protests, marches and rallies held around Vermont. 
The organizers gathered the figures through a combination of headcounts, drone footage and crowd estimation algorithm, Peel said. Calls to local police departments to confirm the figures were not returned as of Thursday evening. 
50501 Vermont sponsored its first protest of just a few hundred people on President’s Day. The effort has grown quickly since then thanks to multi-group coordination, social media, mailing lists, and volunteers working on logistics and planning, according to Peel.
Among the largest of the July 14 protests in 50501 Vermont’s data were Burlington, with 16,500 people; 5,000 in White River Junction and neighboring Lebanon, New Hampshire; and 3,000 in Brattleboro. The sole pro-Trump gathering, in Montpelier, had about 30 people in attendance.

Does this mean it was the largest single-day protest in Vermont history? 
No single source tracks attendance figures, but a review of news archives for other major demonstrations — such as the 2017 Women’s March, the 1970 Earth Day rally and the 1986 Hands Across America fundraiser — failed to turn up any bigger numbers. 
Annelise Orleck, a Dartmouth College professor and historian, said the Green Mountain State has a long track record of involvement in social activism. Vermonters have even ventured beyond its borders to attend national protests in New York City and Washington, D.C. 
“During the 1982 anti-nuclear marches … I think there were representatives from every single town in Vermont,” she said. 
Orleck joined the march in White River Junction and described it as a “remarkably large turnout for such a small town.” She said the feel of the protest was different than others she’s attended or studied. 
“What I think is different about this movement, nationally and locally, is that people don’t feel like the Democratic Party in Washington is standing up in opposition to encroaching fascism,” she said. “There’s a sense that people have to put their bodies out there and respond and resist.” 
Orleck has direct experience with that risk. In 2024, she was arrested and body slammed to the ground while trying to intervene in a clash between pro-Palestinian student protesters and police. That experience has been forefront in her mind as she’s read recent headlines, like Alex Padilla’s forcible removal from a Department of Homeland Security press conference. 
“What went through my mind when I watched how they forced him to the ground and kneeled on his back is (that) there are too many of us unfortunate Americans who know exactly what that feels like, and exactly how scary that can be when they press your face into the ground and you can’t breathe,” she said. 
The Vermont No Kings protests were largely peaceful, although a brief altercation broke out that day when a counter-protester shoved his water bottle into the pro-Trump demonstrators’ celebratory cake. Some violence broke out elsewhere in the country: A man drove an SUV through protesters in Virginia and one protester was fatally shot in Utah. 
Orleck noted that while younger people seem to be taking the lead in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, the No Kings day demonstration appeared to draw an older crowd. 
“I do feel like older people, very viscerally, are recognizing the dangers of encroaching fascism right now,” she said. 
The local nature of the protests created a decentralized feel and enabled people to come who could not have afforded a trip to a major city, she said. It also helped to build local power and hope, Orleck added. 
“When I was standing in the middle of all those people in White River Junction on the bridge to New Hampshire, I said to someone, ‘This feels like I just drank a really good cup of coffee,’” she said. “That’s what it is. It’s energy. It’s community. It’s humor.”

Vermont’s U.S. senators are backing legislation meant to prohibit President Donald Trump from using military force against Iran without first getting approval from Congress to do so — a possibility he has floated as fighting between Iran and Israel intensifies.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, on Monday introduced the “No War Against Iran Act,” which Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., and six other Democratic senators have also signed onto. The bill would prohibit the use of federal funding for military force in or against Iran without specific congressional authorization, with some exceptions for existing federal laws.
“Our Founding Fathers entrusted the power of war and peace exclusively to the people’s elected representatives in Congress, and it is imperative that we make clear that the President has no authority to embark on another costly war without explicit authorization by Congress,” Sanders said in a press release issued this week.

The senators’ push comes as Trump has made repeated warnings, many of them not entirely clear, that the U.S. would join Israel in striking at Iran’s nuclear program. At the same time, Iran’s leader has vowed the U.S. would face retaliation for such a move. 
The Wall Street Journal reported late Wednesday that Trump has privately approved plans to attack Iran but held off on giving the final order to see if the country’s government would abandon its nuclear program. Trump told reporters at the White House earlier that day that, regarding a potential strike, “nobody knows what I’m going to do.” 
On Thursday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump would make a decision on potential military action in the next two weeks.
In statements this week, Vermont’s senators raised opposition not just to the possibility Trump would join in the conflict unilaterally, but also to the fact it could draw the U.S. into a prolonged war in the Middle East and hinder diplomatic solutions.
Sanders said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — whom Sanders has fiercely criticized in recent years — scuttled the possibility of a diplomatic solution to ending Iran’s nuclear program when Israel started attacking targets in Iran last week, adding the strikes “directly contravened the express wishes of the United States, which was seeking a diplomatic resolution to the long-standing tensions” over the program.
“The U.S. must make it clear that we will not be dragged into another Netanyahu war,” he said in a separate press release. “Along with the international community we should do everything possible to prevent an escalation of this conflict and bring the warring parties to the negotiating table.” 
Welch said in a video posted to his social media feeds on Wednesday that U.S. military involvement in Iran — with or without congressional approval — was the wrong path, pointing to past U.S. conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan as examples.
Recent Israeli strikes targeting Iranian military leaders, as well as strikes that have killed civilians in the country’s capital, Tehran, “are telltale signs that the Netanyahu goal is not just about Iran’s nuclear program. It’s about regime change,” Welch said. 
“But you know what?” he continued. “We’ve learned, over and over again, that forcing regime change from outside in, in the Middle East, does not create lasting peace. Quite the opposite.”
For her part, Vermont’s sole delegate to the U.S. House, Democratic Rep. Becca Balint, said this week she was signing onto a resolution led by Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Ca., that’s also aimed at forcing Trump to go through Congress before taking military action against Iran.
Balint wrote in a post on X that she was backing the measure “to prevent the United States from entering another forever war.”

Push led by Eastern Shoshone Tribe to spare longtime federal facility from cuts reached U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's desk. 
The post DOGE’s plans to nix Fish and Wildlife’s tribal-focused Lander office reversed appeared first on WyoFile .","For the second time in four decades, tribal nations and other advocates have successfully fought off efforts to close a federal office devoted to wildlife conservation on the Wind River Indian Reservation. 
Mere months ago, staff were told the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Lander Conservation Office was among seven federal facilities in Wyoming that were being closed as part of the Department of Government Efficiency’s downsizing efforts, then led by billionaire Elon Musk. Subsequently, the Eastern Shoshone Tribe and Shoshone and Arapaho Fish and Game Director Art Lawson urged the Trump administration to reverse course and spare the office that’s been integral to the historic return of healthy wildlife populations within the Yellowstone-sized Wyoming reservation. 
The lobbying worked. 
Recently, the U.S. General Services Administration sent an email to the office and the property owner in Lander informing the parties that the federal government’s lease could continue at the site, according to a source familiar with the situation. 
“It basically said, ‘Keep going on with the current contract,’” said the source, who WyoFile granted anonymity for fear of reprisal. 
Fish and Wildlife public affairs officials weren’t able to be immediately reached for this story.

But U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also confirmed the Lander office’s continued existence in a June 11 exchange with U.S. Sen. John Barrasso. 
“The Lander, Wyoming, office is an important office, and we’re going to make sure that it’s staffed and able to execute … their important duties,” Burgum testified in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. 
Federal workers, Burgum added, will continue to complete their duties in person at the office, located on 1st Street in downtown Lander.
Until the Lander-based federal workers received word they could stay, they’d been anticipating losing their office next March.

The stay on the Lander Fish and Wildlife Conservation Office’s closure marks the second time in 43 years that plans to shutter the facility have failed. Back in 1982, there were efforts within the federal government to close the office, but its founder, Richard Baldes, pushed back and prevailed. 
“Only because of support from the tribes,” Baldes told WyoFile last winter. “They got Wyoming congressional support [in 1982]. And the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the time was supporting this office, and the National Wildlife Federation.”
It’s unclear what other federal offices in Wyoming being DOGE’d have similarly received word of a reversal of fortune, though the Dick Cheney Federal Building in Casper reportedly also came off the chopping block. Federal agencies under the second Trump administration have often been barred from disclosing workforce and facility cuts to the public, and media inquiries typically yield no information.

Are you a federal worker in Wyoming? WyoFile wants to hear from you.

Other offices told they were being closed for cost-saving purposes included the U.S. Geological Survey’s Water Science Center in Cheyenne, U.S. Attorney’s Office in Lander, Social Security Administration facility in Rock Springs, Mine Safety Health Administration Office in Green River, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration office in Cheyenne.

Schnoor, who has served as president of Northern State University in South Dakota, will start in the position July 1 with a $355,000 salary. He succeeds former UNK Chancellor Doug Kristensen, who retired in May 2024 after 22 years, the longest chancellor’s tenure in NU history. Schnoor was a long-time UNK faculty member, from 1997 to 2010, and an administrator from 2012 to 2019.
Interim UNK Chancellor Charlie Bicak came out of retirement during the transition period.
Schnoor, talking with the Nebraska Examiner after his confirmation, said he is returning to the Kearney community, a home where he and his wife, Teresa, raised their two children. All had taken classes at UNK.
“It’s home for our family,” Schnoor said. “Very excited.”
Teresa Schnoor retired this spring after 18 years as principal of Kearney’s Central Elementary School.

Neal Schnoor’s path to South Dakota also mirrors that of Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher, who leads the Nebraska Department of Education. Schnoor said he would talk with Maher soon as they share a passion for teachers and a “pipeline of talent” for various careers.
Schnoor said he would work with Maher and others to visit schools, talk to superintendents and figure out how to increase the pipeline into careers or higher education.
First steps for Schnoor include getting out, listening, talking to constituents and learning what their vision is for UNK and how it matches to future strategic planning.
NU President Jeffrey Gold, who recommended Schnoor’s final approval, called him the “right person at the right time.” Gold on Thursday highlighted Schnoor’s “wealth of experience” and deep connections with UNK and Kearney.
Gold said NU would “not immediately” pivot to finding a permanent University of Nebraska Medical Center chancellor. Interim Chancellor H. Dele Davies succeeded Gold when he ascended to president last year. Gold said NU would “absolutely” look at the three-year contract of University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett before it expires June 30, 2026.
The fourth NU chancellor, University of Nebraska at Omaha Chancellor Joanne Li, who joined NU in 2021, has no end date listed in her contract.

(Courtesy of the University of Nebraska)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska Board of Regents on Thursday approved a 5% tuition increase for the next academic year, coming as state dollars for NU have slowed under the latest budget from Gov. Jim Pillen and the Legislature.
The regents, by a 6-2 vote, approved NU’s operating budget beginning July 1 through June 30, 2026. Nebraska lawmakers approved a 0.625% increase in state dollars ($4.35 million), which is well short of the 3.5% annual increase regents had requested last August, primarily to cover inflationary pressures. The budget that regents passed also calls for $20 million in additional cuts across NU’s $1.1 billion “state-aided budget.”
Regents Rob Schafer of Beatrice and Kathy Wilmot of Beaver City opposed the regents’ budget.
Had Pillen’s initially proposed 2% cut to NU this next fiscal year been approved, regents said they could have considered a larger tuition increase or greater cuts. NU President Jeffrey Gold and Pillen, who served as a regent for 10 years before becoming governor, negotiated for what Gold described as a “modest” state increase.”

However, Gold noted, the increase doesn’t cover the rising costs of employee benefits or strategic investments “required to sustain and build upon our momentum.”
“We are responding to these challenges and doing everything we can to turn them into opportunities with discipline and care,” Gold said, noting federal funding uncertainty has also complicated NU’s mission.
This is the third straight year that regents have considered tuition increases after freezing tuition for two years in response for the COVID-19 pandemic. Tuition increased by 3.5% in each of the past two years.
‘It’s a hard day’
Multiple regents said considering tuition increases at all was “painful,” but they said it was their responsibility. Many said the alternative would have been to pass costs on to students or hurt the quality of education that Gold said Nebraskans expect and deserve. Gold said the proposal would still keep NU affordable compared to peer institutions, including within the Big Ten Conference.
“To be doing this really hurts,” said Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha.
“It’s a hard day, and we have to make hard choices,” Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha said.

Regents Tim Clare of Lincoln and Jim Scheer of Norfolk, who succeeded Pillen, said NU needed to continue working with the Legislature to highlight the critical need for investing in NU. Clare said that while budget woes have “monopolized” attention, regents need to stand by Gold and his “odyssey to the extraordinary” strategic plan to improve NU.
“We cannot cut our way to prosperity,” Clare said.
Gold told the Nebraska Examiner that NU is “laser focused” on high-value, affordable education and that it must be top quality. He said every time a student gets a degree, it must be associated with “world-class education.”
“The reality of it is it takes people, it takes focus, takes strategy, and, of course, it takes resources to make that happen,” Gold said.
Legislative investments
Clare, now in his 17th year on the board, said that rather than looking at state dollars as an “appropriation,” it should be framed as an investment — NU boasts a $10 return for every $1 investment, according to the most recent economic report commissioned through the Tripp Umbach consulting firm. Clare described the tuition increase as a “tax” on students.
Scheer and Clare noted that part of the reason state dollars are more rigid is a legislative and Pillen-led focus on property tax relief.

However, Scheer said, many entities receiving replacement revenue to lower or cover property tax rates still retain additional taxing authority to make up lost revenue. 
Scheer, who served in the Legislature for eight years, including as speaker, said that in reducing property taxes, lawmakers have been “robbing Peter to pay Paul.” He said it comes at the expense of NU this year or other institutions of higher learning in other years.
“It is what it is, but I’m hoping the Legislature will have the ability to look deeper into their budgeting process to see what happens when you reduce the funding of the university,” Scheer said.
Clare said cutting property taxes isn’t the solution; broadening the tax base is.
“We have to figure out how we’re going to grow our state, and the university has to be at the table,” Clare said.
Scheer said the tuition freezes before he joined the regents also exacerbated the current situation, saying that, eventually, those costs come back “to bite you in the ass.”
‘Toss the towel’ on college?
Schafer suggested NU needs to consider a serious restructuring, without specifying what that could look like, which he said should be investigated over the next year.

Wilmot noted she didn’t support the tuition increase in 2024 and said the Legislature doesn’t appear to be changing course. She said she couldn’t “swallow” the proposal, knowing regents could return next year for another tuition proposal if the Legislature doesn’t increase NU’s funding during its next budget adjustments.
“I do believe we’re going to have kids now toss the towel in of going to college,” Wilmot said. “We are going to impact a lot of lives.”
Multidisciplinary studies
Part of Thursday’s meeting that drew attention was whether to create a “multidisciplinary studies” major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, roughly a catch-all degree program for students who have varied college credits as a flexible degree path.
The University of Nebraska at Omaha has had a similar program since 1951, leading UNO Chancellor Joanne Li to worry whether the same degree name could cause “market confusion.”
Scheer, defending Li, said he wasn’t trying to pick winners and losers and urged his colleagues to consider the name, now or in the future.
“I don’t think it’s asking too much to try to protect that interest by that campus,” Scheer said.

UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett told the regents that it might be a good idea to look at other “duplicative” programs in the future, which Li pushed back on. She said she wasn’t talking about “duplication” but merely about markets; Li has a doctorate in finance.
Schafer told Scheer that there are many other degrees with the same name, such as accounting, and that “a rose by any other name is still a rose.”
“Maybe not, we haven’t said what color it is,” Scheer responded.
Interim Executive Vice Chancellor Mark Button of UNL said the intention of the UNL program is to provide a flexible pathway for students from community colleges to come to the university. He said the proposal was developed with multiple community colleges and that such a program could be worthwhile at all NU campuses.
On the condition that Gold consider a name change in the future, regents unanimously approved the program at UNL, which officials said wouldn’t require additional faculty or funds.
A ‘forward-thinking’ NU
Gold said the path ahead would not be easy, especially with financial constraints, but that there are “real opportunities” to be more nimble, innovative and intentional in serving Nebraskans.
“With a unified team and with a shared sense of purpose,” Gold said. “I have no doubt that the University of Nebraska will continue to thrive, to be one of our state’s and our nation’s greatest assets and an exemplar of superb and forward-thinking public higher education.”
Also unanimously approved during Thursday’s meeting:

An undergraduate robotics engineering degree within UNL’s College of Engineering.
A Diabetes Center of Excellence in Diabetes Care, Research and Education (C-DIACARE) in the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s College of Medicine to leverage existing UNMC dollars with external funding to coordinate NU research and education around diabetes (nearly 12% of the county had diabetes as of 2021). Dr. Andjela Drincic, a UNMC professor of diabetes, endocrinology and metabolism at UNMC, is set to be the inaugural director of the center.
Neal Schnoor as the next chancellor of the University of Nebraska at Kearney, beginning July 1 with a $355,000 salary.

(Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan)You probably don’t know much about “The Chop House Affair” or the man who was arrested at his own wedding for wearing an Elks pin because those stories were intentionally left out of most state history accounts for differing reasons – some deliberate and malicious, others more benign.
But as Montana celebrates Juneteenth — the commemoration of the Emancipation Proclamation, and news of which finally reached slaves in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865 — historian Kate Hampton of the Montana Historical Society spoke about the unexplored and unheralded contributions made by African-American Montanans, and the efforts to read those histories, many heartbreaking and discriminatory, into the record. Hampton spoke at the Western Heritage Center on Thursday afternoon in Billings.
“The Chop House Affair,” as Hampton has named it, didn’t even have a name because nearly as soon as news of it became public, the white press in Montana wanted to ignore it, or it was relegated to several innocuous sentences. Montana had three Black-owned newspapers, which have helped preserve a different, largely unrecognized history.
The incident took place in September 1881 in Butte when William Woodcock, a Black man, traveled to Butte from Helena with the man he helped care for, Alexander Botkin, a white man who would later go on to become Montana’s second lieutenant governor from 1893 to 1897. Botkin was paralyzed, used a wheelchair, and Woodcock was his hired servant and a beloved figured in Helena.
However, as the two met Botkin’s brother for dinner in Butte, they went to the Virginia Chop House, which was arranged with large tables, making dining communal. When the table with Botkin was too full, Woodcock moved to a different table, upsetting an unnamed white patron. The restaurant told Woodcock he couldn’t dine there.
Woodcock became so upset by the treatment that he took the proprietor to court, suing under the relatively new 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guaranteed equal protection of the law. Amazingly for its time, Hampton said, the district court found in Woodcock’s favor, awarding him $500 — which would translate to more than $16,000 in today’s value.
“That should have been front-page news, but it wasn’t. You could hardly find any mention of it because there was a concern among leaders and newspapers that it would suggest others do the same,” Hampton said.
The silence seemed to work because a decade later, Black-owned newspapers around the state still noted the state’s largest mines — the largest economic engine in Montana — refused to hire Black citizens to work. Meanwhile, Black people reported searching for places to eat because restaurants, even in its capital, refused to serve them.
Montana’s white Legislature even passed laws that took banning interracial marriage farther than other states. In addition to outlawing interracial marriage, Montana took the unusual step of nullifying marriages or refusing to recognize marriage between couples of mixed races, even refusing to recognize the marriages if they were performed in a different state or where the practice was legal.
In a sign of how deeply Jim Crow laws penetrated beyond the states of the Confederacy and American South, the Legislature in 1907 outlawed non-white members of fraternal organizations from wearing pins, ribbons or other identification associated with those organizations.
“In Montana, they only wanted people wearing these insignias who looked like them,” Hampton said.
In 1908, William Holland, a Black man, was literally ripped away from his own wedding for wearing a diamond pin with the Elks insignia.
“He was arrested at his own wedding,” Hampton said.
The Montana Supreme Court struck down the law, saying it clearly violated the Equal Protections clause, punishing one group of people for wearing a pin or symbol that others could wear freely.
That case, too, Hampton said, escaped much notice from the media at the time, again fearing that widespread knowledge of it might encourage others to take their civil right complaints to court.
“Most of our history books and articles fail to realize or mention the contributions of the past,” Hampton said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Hampton-Juneteenth-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-19 18:02:59.621665

Kelly Ayotte speaks to reporters about the House's budget proposal on Wednesday, April 9, 2025.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte vowed Thursday to veto the New Hampshire budget unless lawmakers reverse cuts to health care services, education, and retirement benefits — plunging the spending agreement into uncertainty as it enters its final stretch.
Speaking to WMUR Thursday, Ayotte said she could not sign the two-year spending bill, pointing to last-minute changes made by the House and Senate this week..
“If this budget were to come to me now I couldn’t support it and I’d have to veto it,” she said. 
Ayotte’s pledge leaves little maneuvering room for lawmakers. House and Senate negotiators reached an agreement Thursday on House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, the spending and policy budget bills. Those bills cannot be changed now.
And while the full House and Senate will meet Thursday, June 26, for an up-or-down vote on the  final spending package, lawmakers are not allowed to make changes then either. Floor amendments are not permitted this late in the process, according to House Clerk Paul Smith. 
That leaves lawmakers with two unpalatable choices: vote down the budget next Thursday and assemble a package Ayotte will sign, or pass it and challenge the governor to veto it.
Meanwhile, the Legislature faces a tight deadline. The current two-year budget expires June 30; there must be a spending agreement in place by then. That might require lawmakers to pass a short-term continuing resolution when they meet Thursday.
The standoff echoed the budget process of 2017, when a small group of fiscal conservatives derailed the House’s budget over complaints it did not cut enough spending, forcing the Senate to forge a compromise bill with Democrats. And it came as Ayotte has faced broad disagreements with House Republicans over spending, in a year where state revenues have been lagging behind expectations. 
The last time a governor vetoed the budget was 2019, when Republican Gov. Chris Sununu rejected a Democrat-passed budget over objections that it did not continue a series of planned business tax cuts. In that case, lawmakers passed a continuing resolution in June and a compromise bill did not pass until September.
For Ayotte, three concerns are driving her veto threat: the paring back of a proposal to restore certain state retirement benefits; reductions to the state Department of Health and Human Services; and a change in school funding formula that would see Manchester receive $10 million less than under the current formula. 
Ayotte also expressed frustration about the secrecy of the late budget agreements.
“The 11th-hour backroom deal fails to deliver on the promise that we made to all of New Hampshire,” she said Thursday.
Retirement fix jumps the rails
One of Ayotte’s biggest policy priorities this year has been to reverse what was supposed to be a short-term cut to first-responder retirement benefits made 14 years ago.
In 2011, facing the global financial crisis and a massive unfunded liability in the state’s pension fund, lawmakers made deep cuts to retirement benefits for “Group II” employees. Those employees, who include former police officers, corrections officers, and firefighters, saw promised benefits cut as part of a change in the pension formula. 
Ayotte devoted funding in her budget to providing additional benefits to Group II retirees vested before Sept. 1, 2013, by increasing what counts toward their earnable compensation when they were working. And the House and Senate passed similar versions of that policy in their budget proposals this year.
But on Wednesday, four days into public negotiations between House and Senate leaders over the final budget agreement, lawmakers introduced an amendment to scale back the previously agreed to restoration of benefits, with some raising concerns about the unpredictable cost of Ayotte’s approach. The new amendment introduces a cap of $120,000 per year for the eligible Group II retirees and eliminates their three highest-earning years from consideration toward compensation, among other changes.
Ayotte swiftly opposed the late amendment, as did a coalition representing police, fire, and corrections unions. “We have a responsibility to take care of the men and women who have helped make New Hampshire the safest state in the nation,” the governor said Wednesday, hours after the surprise amendment. “The changes made to the budget today shirk that responsibility and continue the past mistake of not providing police officers, firefighters, and corrections officers the benefits they have earned.” 
But on Thursday, after Ayotte’s veto comments, House Speaker Sherman Packard praised the final deal. 
“The Group II retirement proposal is better than what these folks have today, and it is what’s currently possible with funding limitations, while balancing the needs of everything else that gets state funding,” Packard said in a statement.
Health care funding cuts
Ayotte has also objected to cuts to health care services. In the House budget proposal, the House passed a $46 million “back of the budget” cut to the Department of Health and Human Services. That cut would require the department to find $46 million in savings without directing the commissioner how to do so. 
When the budget came to the Senate, the chamber increased that back of the budget cut to $51 million. 
Meanwhile, lawmakers nearly cut $18.8 million to developmental disabilities services in the budget. They passed an amendment to do so Wednesday, but reversed course Thursday morning, restoring the funding. 
Ayotte’s proposed budget, which relied on rosier revenue projections than the House or Senate versions, did not include any back-of-the budget cuts to DHHS. 
On Thursday, Ayotte said the budget “fails in terms of serving our most vulnerable citizens.”
An education funding formula change
Ayotte’s final concern with the House’s budget centered on lawmakers’ proposed change to the school funding formula — specifically, a shift in targeted aid that could see Manchester lose out on $10 million in funding.
The state currently has two targeted aid programs in which the state pays out additional funding on top of the standard per-pupil adequacy funding to school districts with higher populations of low-income students and districts with low property values.
The two types of assistance, known as “fiscal capacity disparity aid” and “extraordinary needs grants,” are designed to give an additional boost to “property poor” districts and help bridge the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged districts. 
But this year, Republican Sen. Tim Lang, of Sanbornton, added a cap that would reduce the amount paid out per pupil for large districts. The amendment would apply a cap to school districts with 5,000 or more students; those districts would receive per pupil funding under the standard formula for the first 5,000 students but any students after that would be capped at $3,750 per pupil. 
The cap would apply only to targeted aid; it would not affect the $4,200 in base funding districts get per student under the adequacy formula, nor any additional aid categories under that formula. 
According to estimates by the Legislative Budget Assistant, the cap would affect only Manchester, which has 12,105 public school students. In the 2024-2025 school year, Manchester received $116 million in targeted aid; under the proposal, the district would receive $128 million in the 2025-2026 school year, but then $117 million in the 2026-2027 school year, when the cap took effect.
In a statement Wednesday, Manchester Mayor Jay Ruais spoke against the cut.
“I appreciate the difficult nature of this budget cycle and respect the challenging decisions that must be made during this process,” he said. “I urge the Legislature to pursue an alternative path forward that prevents a significant $10.2 million cut that will detrimentally impact Manchester’s students, and our city.”
Manchester Executive Councilor John Stephen, a Republican, accused lawmakers of making Manchester “the whipping child” for balancing the budget. 
And Ayotte also opposed what she called a “drastic cut” that “hurts students and teachers and undercuts our future.”
“I urge the Legislature to reverse this cut so we can deliver a best-in-class education to children in Manchester and continue to return historic levels of education funding to the local level,” Ayotte said Wednesday. 
By Thursday evening, though, the committee of conference budget agreement was signed, and lawmakers were heading home.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4093387-Ayotte-budget-remarks-1024x756.jpg,,,2025-06-19 18:02:59.621665

In the latest development in an ongoing animal cruelty investigation, the owner of the Friesians of Majesty horse farm was charged Tuesday with animal cruelty and violating conditions of release. Authorities seized more than three dozen horses from the property. 
Thirty-nine horses were removed from a private Townshend business as part of an investigation by the state Animal Welfare Division and Vermont State Police, Joshua Morse, a spokesperson for the Fish & Wildlife Department, confirmed to VTDigger in a statement.
“The 39 horses have been moved to a private partner that can provide adequate space and care,” the statement read. 
Friesians owner Robert Labrie faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $2,000 fine under the animal cruelty charge. The charge for violating conditions of release could result in up to six months in prison and a $1,000 fine.

Jen Straub, executive director of Dorset Equine Rescue, said this was the fourth time she has assisted an investigation at Friesians of Majesty. The rescue has taken in 74 horses from the farm since the first seizure in 2023, she said. 
Straub said she has aided in animal welfare investigations numerous times over the years in Vermont and other states, but Tuesday’s operation was by far the most horses the organization has taken in one seizure. 
Approximately 25 horses remain on the farm, she said. 
Straub said the seized horses had various ailments, including emaciation, skin infections or other injuries, some that were left untreated. Two of the 39 horses needed to be hospitalized, she added.

According to a probable cause affidavit, Detective Sgt. David Taddei for the Department of Fish & Wildlife’s Warden Service wrote he visited the Townshend farm Tuesday after obtaining a warrant to investigate potential animal cruelty. 
State Veterinarian Kaitlynn Levine accompanied Taddei and identified horses that were underweight. The duo said they witnessed “unacceptable conditions for horses to be living in,” according to the affidavit. 
“They did not have access to shelter and there was no natural shelter,” the affidavit stated. “Their entire paddock was mud and horse feces, with the exception of a large rock in the upper area of the paddock, which all the horses were competing to stand on.”
Labrie was arrested Tuesday morning on an animal cruelty charge. Labrie was ordered to appear in court in Brattleboro the next day, and then he was released from the Westminster State Police Barracks on the condition that he not return to the farm until after the state had completed its investigation.
However, Labrie returned to the property Tuesday afternoon while the search was ongoing and was arrested a second time, according to a probable cause affidavit by Warden Noelle Kline. 
Labrie refused to sign citation documents as well as the bail and conditions of release orders after both arrests, according to court filings. 
Straub said some of the 39 horses will remain at the Dorset rescue, while others are set to go to rescue farms in Maine and Maryland while the case proceeds. 
“To absorb 39 horses when you already have a full rescue full of horses is really, really challenging,” Straub said. “We are really grateful that a couple of other rescues were able to step up and offer help to take in some of the horses, so once they’re medically sound and stable, we will be transferring some to them.”
Straub said a judge ordered the 13 horses seized in 2023 to be forfeited to Dorset Equine Rescue, and most have since been adopted. But the horses seized in 2024 from the Townshend farm have not been forfeited through the court system and are still under the rescue’s care.
Dorset Equine Rescue is tasked with covering all medical bills, transportation, food and staff to care for the horses because neither the state nor federal government provide funding for animal welfare organizations in Vermont, she said.
Straub said she purchased a 178-acre property in Rupert after a fundraiser last year. She set up temporary fencing and structures on the property for the influx of horses from the Townshend farm. Straub plans to launch a fundraiser to build permanent structures to expand the rescue’s capacity and better meet the high need to care for rescued horses.
“We get asked to take horses every single day, whether it’s from a neglect case or the owner surrenders (because) they can’t afford the horses,” Straub said. “The need is huge.”

Annual premiums for plans sold to businesses and nonprofits with more than 100 employees will increase by almost 14% on average next year.

The Green Mountain Care Board approved double-digit increases to the premium rates that Vermont’s biggest health insurance provider can charge large employers next year.
Vermont’s main health care regulator will allow Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont to increase the cost of health insurance premiums for Vermont employers with more than 100 employees by an average of 13.7% in 2026, according to a press release from the Green Mountain Care Board. The rate increase is expected to affect just under 5,000 people in the state.
The approved rate increase for the same category of plan for 2025 was 8.4% on average.
“We are committed to ensuring that health insurance rates are as affordable and fair for Vermonters as possible while balancing the need for insurer solvency and access to care,” Owen Foster, Chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, said in the press release. 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont is facing significant financial challenges brought on by a surge in the cost of health care claims over the past several years. In response, Blue Cross Blue Shield and the state’s other major insurer, MVP, have both increased rates significantly, making health insurance costs in Vermont among the highest in the nation.

Foster pointed to the findings of a study done last year by national consulting firm Oliver Wyman as evidence of the need for major restructuring in Vermont’s health care system to bring costs under control.
“As identified in the Oliver Wyman report, Vermont’s health system requires significant transformation to address gaps in care, ensure provider sustainability, and to protect Vermonters from excessive healthcare costs.”
The rate increase approved by the Green Mountain Care Board represents a reduction from the 17.3% premium hike that Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont had initially requested for next year. 
Cutting the increase was possible because of recent efforts by the board and lawmakers to clamp down on the prices for hospital-based services and certain prescription drugs, the regulator said. 
According to the press release, the bulk of the reduction is due to the passage of H.266, a law that caps the price that hospitals can charge insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont for outpatient pharmaceuticals. In testimony before lawmakers this year, a spokesperson for the nonprofit insurer projected that the cap would contribute to a reduction of between three and four percentage points on premium increases for next year.
The trimmed rate increase also reflects the Green Mountain Care Board’s enforcement actions against the University of Vermont Medical Center and Rutland Regional Medical Center related to their earnings from 2023, as well as the guidance the regulator set for all the state’s hospitals as they build their 2026 budgets.
The decision comes as Blue Cross Blue Shield Vermont awaits approval to raise rates in 2026 for other plans sold on the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace. Last month, the insurance company asked regulators to approve an average rate increase of about 19.8% for individual plans and 22.8% for small group plans. 
This decision suggests that the Green Mountain Care Board may also reduce those premium rate requests in similar ways.

Friday evening and lasting into Sunday, a prolonged rain event could produce 2-4 inches in a 48-hour period, which could result in potential rock and debris slides along steep terrain in Glacier National Park.
From Saturday afternoon through Sunday, higher elevations of Glacier National Park, such as Going-to-the-Sun Road and Logan Pass, could see heavy wet snow accumulation of up to a foot for elevations above 6,000 feet and up to 4 inches for elevations down to 4,000 feet.
Visitors are encouraged to prepare for inclement weather if they plan to travel to the park this week.
Check the weather forecast and the park website before your visit, dress for varying degrees of weather, and be on alert for potential hazards on roadways and trails. Visitors can also sign up for GNP notifications to receive road status updates by texting GNPROADS to 333111.

Going-to-the-Sun Road Reservations and Amenities
Visitor information services and the Glacier National Park Conservancy bookstore will be available at the Logan Pass Visitor Center starting June 14. Visitors are reminded to pack water and snacks as food and water are not available for purchase at the Logan Pass Visitor Center. Restrooms will be open.
Timed entry vehicle reservations are available through the next-day reservations available at 7 p.m. each day. Timed entry vehicle reservations are only available on Recreation.gov and not available at the park.
Timed entry vehicle reservations are required to enter Going-to-the-Sun Road from the west side of the park past Apgar Campground. Reservations will be required for those traveling by vehicle or motorcycle from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. beginning June 13 through September 28, 2025. Visitors who miss their time block or visitors without a timed entry vehicle reservation can enter after 3 p.m.
Visitors with lodging, camping, or commercial activity reservations (e.g., boat tours and horseback rides) within the specified reservation areas can use proof of their reservation for entry instead of a timed entry vehicle reservation to gain access to the area for which they have a service reservation. Service reservations originating east of Logan Pass cannot be used instead of a timed entry vehicle reservation for access past the Apgar Check Point heading east on Going-to-the-Sun Road.
Parking at Logan Pass, Apgar Village, and other areas may be congested or temporarily unavailable. Daily shuttle service along Going-to-the-Sun Road will begin operating July 1, on a first-come, first-served basis at the Apgar and St. Mary Visitor Centers with stops along Going-to-the-Sun Road. Visitors are encouraged to take advantage of the free shuttle for hiker access to Logan Pass although waits for shuttles may be long depending on the time and location. Check the park website for additional information on shuttle stops.
While driving along the road, particularly through the Rim Rock area (approximately one mile west of Logan Pass) visitors should be aware of potential rockfall and should not slow down or stop in this section. Rocks and other debris continue to fall throughout the summer, requiring daily clean up. With the level of snow at Logan Pass, visitors should use extreme caution and refrain from crossing snowfields or standing under snow overhangs.

The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.
She tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad.
So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
Harriet Tubman
Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.

“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
Finding the story
As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands who drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

Juneteenth commemorates the date when enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, received news of the Emancipation Proclamation. One year later, they gathered to honor the anniversary of their freedom, eventually leading to Texas being the first state to formally recognize the date as a state holiday.
In New Orleans, slavery was abolished through a constitutional council meeting on May 11, 1864, amidst the Civil War. Black New Orleanians gathered in Congo Square — where Juneteenth celebrations are still held today — to celebrate with a parade and live music.

(Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)South Dakotans should be grateful they’re not represented by the likes of Mike Lee.
When the Republican U.S. senator from Utah heard about Saturday’s murder of a Minnesota Democratic state representative and her husband, along with the wounding of a Democratic state senator and his wife, Lee’s instinct was to politicize it.
On his personal X page (formerly Twitter), Lee described the shootings as a “Nightmare on Waltz Street,” in an apparent attempt to connect the tragedy to Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, whose name Lee misspelled. Lee also posted, “This is what happens when Marxists don’t get their way,” apparently implying that people with views on the far left side of the political spectrum deserved the blame.
Widespread criticism of the grossly false and inflammatory posts caused Lee to remove them on Tuesday. Yet he did not remove other posts with similar language about the shootings, including one that said “Marxism kills.”

  Screenshots of X posts that remained on Sen. Mike Lee’s personal page as of June 19, 2025. The posts were in reference to June 14 shootings in Minnesota that killed a state representative and her husband, and wounded a state senator and his wife.

Unlike Lee, South Dakota’s all-Republican congressional delegation responded humanely. Senate Majority Leader John Thune was “horrified” by the shootings, Sen. Mike Rounds was “disturbed,” and Rep. Dusty Johnson was “appalled.” All three condemned political violence in their public statements. South Dakota’s legislative leaders also released a joint, bipartisan statement condemning the attacks.
I am grateful for that. But I’m also frustrated. I’m frustrated by politicians who condemn violence some of the time, and then enable it at other times with their silence and their votes.
Earlier this year, Thune, Rounds and Johnson stood by as President Trump pardoned or released from prison about 1,500 people who violently stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. None of the three men forcefully condemned the pardons, presumably because doing so would’ve harmed their standing with Trump and his supporters. At the time, all three of their staffs ignored multiple emails from me seeking a comment.
But they could not duck the questions forever. Thune had the toughest time dodging reporters, due to his leadership role. When a pack of journalists confronted him in a D.C. hallway, he avoided criticizing the pardons. “We’re not looking backwards,” Thune said. “We’re looking forward.”
Rounds went a little further, but not much, telling NBC News, “The president made that decision. You’ll have to ask him. I will not defend it.”
Johnson told South Dakota News Watch in February that “we shouldn’t be condoning violence,” but he did not directly condemn Trump for doing precisely that. Then Johnson pivoted to criticize former President Joe Biden’s pardon of his son, Hunter Biden.
Republican legislators in South Dakota, meanwhile, have spent years enabling gun violence by eliminating every common-sense gun restriction our state ever had. Last winter, they passed laws allowing concealed handguns on college campuses and in bars.
Not every Republican has always fallen in line with their colleagues in the Legislature’s super-majority party. Some have defended the decades-old societal consensus that there are places guns don’t belong. Two examples leap to mind from the legislative session that ended in March.
Rep. Jim Halverson, a Republican from Winner and a former Highway Patrol trooper, spoke out against guns on college campuses.
“I have a really bad feeling about people in dorms with weapons,” he said. “It feels to me like a recipe for disaster.”
Rep. Steve Duffy, a Republican from Rapid City, spoke out against guns in bars while noting that he grew up in a family that owned a bar.
“This is crazy,” he said. “When you mix booze and guns, I don’t know how you can expect anything good to happen. Sooner or later, there’s going to be trouble.”
Halverson and Duffy didn’t just condemn violence. They each voted against the bill they criticized, at great risk to their electoral fortunes in a party that’s heavily influenced by gun lobbyists.
We need more of that if we’re ever going to turn back the modern tides of gun violence and political violence. Having better sense than Mike Lee is a start, and issuing condemnations when it’s the easy and obvious response is even better. But we also need condemnations when it’s politically risky, and we need votes along with voices.

(Julia Beverly for the Georgia Recorder)MARIETTA, Ga. – Selina and Howie Newton were first-time visitors at Marietta’s Juneteenth festival, but the anniversary of the official end of slavery in America has always been a big deal in their household.
Selina enjoys decorating the front of their house during the month of June to mark the occasion. And as they strolled through Marietta Square last weekend, the couple sported Juneteenth shirts and color coordinated shoes.
“We really don’t celebrate the Fourth of July as Independence Day the way some people do,” Howie Newton said. “So that has a lot to do with why I feel the way I do about Juneteenth.”
This year, Georgia’s Juneteenth celebrations  are happening at a fraught time nationally for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as President Donald Trump moves to scale back DEI programs and funding. And some of these Juneteenth celebrations, including here in Georgia, have felt the impact, as some sponsors withdraw their support.
“In spite of those efforts and the repressive, tense political climate generally, there will be a number of Juneteenth celebrations here in the metro Atlanta area and throughout the state this year,” said Clarissa Myrick-Harris White, who is a professor of Africana studies at Morehouse College.

Juneteenth commemorates the freeing of the final group of slaves under the Emancipation Proclamation. Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the proclamation in 1863, it took an additional two years for the news to reach Galveston, Texas. It wasn’t until General Gordon Granger led Union troops through Galveston on June 19, 1865, that over 250,000 slaves learned of their freedom.
Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021 after the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by former President Joe Biden. Georgia Gov. Brain Kemp signed similar legislation in 2022 making Juneteenth a state holiday with paid time off for state employees.
While at least one state – West Virginia – has revoked the 2025 holiday observance, Juneteenth is still a federal and state holiday in Georgia.
“It has just really always been the intention to embrace what freedom is, embracing freedom and inclusion all the way across the board,” said Jeriene Bonner-Willis, the Cobb County NAACP president. “This has been about unification. As we look at 2025, it’s a celebration. It’s supposed to honor the history and the experience of enslaved, African Americans.”
Pat Snipes, the executive director of the Before Slavery Project, saw Juneteenth as the perfect place to reach her target audience. The project aims to educate people on the rich history and legacy of the people caught up in the Transatlantic slave trade.
With an exhibit at the Marietta History Center just steps away from where she set up her booth, Snipes said she hopes to help African Americans forge deeper connections with their culture. Aware that the emphasis on Black history could be diminished by DEI cutbacks, Snipes is determined to continue her mission not only on Juneteenth, but every day.
“It’s disheartening to hear that our country is taking several steps back, but we can’t let that stop us,” Snipes said. “We have to continue to move forward and be hopeful.”
While some celebrated Juneteenth on Saturday, others participated in “No Kings” Protests across the state. This juxtaposition occurred in Marietta, where smells of smoked meat and fresh popcorn floated in the air joining echoes of noisy chants from neighboring protesters.
The anti-Trump protests transpired as a nationwide response to a D.C. military parade for the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army. Saturday was not the first time Trump has hosted a large event around Juneteenth. He faced criticism during his first term for planning a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19, 2020. The rally was eventually rescheduled for the next day, but not until after Trump claimed to popularize the holiday with his scheduling conflict.
Marietta wasn’t the only city celebrating Juneteenth last weekend. Atlanta also celebrated with a parade and music festival in Piedmont Park. Other cities, including Augusta, will continue celebrations throughout the week.

Atlanta and Augusta’s festivals faced difficulty fundraising after sponsorships were withdrawn due to DEI reversals. Johnny Gregory III, the president of Band of Brothers Augusta, which hosts the Juneteenth festival, said that a few previous sponsors of the annual celebration ended their sponsorship after company-based DEI changes.
“We’ve noticed that it’s more of the corporations that are internationally and nationally known that are not supporting the local events and cultural events,” Gregory III said.
Juneteenth Atlanta faced similar problems, according to an Instagram post just days ahead of last weekend’s celebration.
“As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, we’ve faced unexpected challenges with sponsorships this year due to the national DEI backlash. But here’s the thing: our community deserves this celebration, and we believe in the power of coming together!” the post said.
As Juneteenth celebrations continue, a shared sense of preservation and perseverance remain.
Small business owners in Augusta have helped fill the gap of withdrawn sponsorships. In Atlanta, festivities continued through summer showers. Even with the challenges this year, supporters of Juneteenth say the holiday serves as a reminder and opportunity to celebrate and reflect.
“Music, parades, food and cultural commemorations are very good and important, but it has to go beyond that,” Myrick-Harris White said. “There needs to be an understanding that Juneteenth, in and of itself, as a national holiday, is symbolic. It affirms the importance of remembering historical events that uniquely impact Black people. I applaud the symbolic act as a reminder, it’s a reaffirmation of the promise of freedom.”

(Washington State Department of Transportation)This article was first published by TVW.
Summer in Washington is supposed to be a season of celebration: high school graduations, family road trips, long weekends at the lake. But traffic safety officials view it as the most dangerous time of year.
The 100 days between Memorial Day and Labor Day are statistically the deadliest stretch on Washington’s roads. This year, the state is expanding efforts to turn the tide on a post-pandemic spike in highway fatalities.
“In 2023, we had the highest number of traffic deaths that we’ve seen in 33 years,” said Shelly Baldwin, acting director of the Washington Traffic Safety Commission. Speaking on TVW’s Inside Olympia, she told host Austin Jenkins, “It’s just unbelievable when you think about all the progress we’d made prior to this.”
Preliminary numbers for 2024 show a roughly 10% decline in fatalities, the first in several years. But Baldwin calls the improvement modest and warns against complacency. “After four years of increasing, that decrease feels like I can take a breath. It’s good. Although I know and met with the families that have lost loved ones this year…we just have so much work ahead of us.”
Targeting the “fatal four”
State officials say the vast majority of deadly crashes can be traced back to just four risky behaviors: impaired driving, speeding, distraction, and failure to wear a seat belt.
“About 75% of fatalities have one of four factors: the driver was impaired, the driver was driving too fast, people in the car weren’t buckled up, and distraction,” Baldwin said.
That data point is at the heart of Washington’s summer safety campaign, dubbed “The 100 Safest Days of Summer.” Instead of focusing solely on enforcement, the campaign also emphasizes public awareness, social norms, and behavior change.
“Culture changes through conversations,” Baldwin said. “We’ve been hitting the news media a lot. We’ve been hitting paid media a lot. We have a network of Target Zero managers that represent every county in the state.”
Engineering and enforcement
The state is doing more than messaging. It’s also redesigning the physical landscape. More roundabouts are going in across the state — especially in rural areas — to reduce intersection speeds. Road designs are increasingly intended to “make you feel like you’re going the right speed, rather than having a big open road that makes you feel like you’re safer going faster,” Baldwin said.
On the enforcement side, the Washington State Patrol is adding 21 troopers focused on high-risk corridors, using crash data to guide their deployments. Target Zero Troopers — officers assigned specifically to traffic safety — are also being deployed in eight districts this summer.
“They’re very serious about changing this bad trend,” Baldwin said. “And I think it’ll be amazing. I’m so excited to see what happens.”
Telematics and technology
One of the state’s most powerful new tools is telematics — anonymized GPS and sensor data collected from cars and phones that reveal real-time driver behavior. With funding from the Governor’s Highway Safety Association, Washington has created telematics maps for each patrol district, showing exactly where and when dangerous behaviors are happening.
“We can see really dangerous speeders,” Baldwin said. “So we might know that at night in this location, there’s a handful of people who like to race.”
This data-driven approach is allowing law enforcement to target resources efficiently. And the technology has revealed some troubling trends: while roadside surveys observed about 10% of drivers using phones behind the wheel, telematics showed it was closer to 30%.
Washington is also experimenting with in-car technologies to deter repeat offenders. The Legislature recently passed a law allowing judges to order speed-limiting devices in the vehicles of chronic speeders.
“That device actually knows where you are, knows what the speed limit is, and just prevents you from going over it,” Baldwin said. “It doesn’t just tell you you’re speeding. It doesn’t let the car speed.”
Prevention through policy and education
Officials had hoped to take another leap this year by lowering the state’s legal blood alcohol limit from 0.08 to 0.05 — a move already adopted in Utah and many countries abroad. The bill passed several committees but did not receive a floor vote.
“I’m very, very disappointed that we didn’t pass it,” Baldwin said. “We know that it will have at least an 11% effect on our fatals…It’s the most preventative bill we could pass.”
Lawmakers did approve a major overhaul of Washington’s driver education system. Starting in 2027, the state will phase in a requirement that all drivers under 21 complete a certified training program. Scholarships and instructor recruitment will target rural and underserved communities.
“What we saw was a lot of people waiting until they were 18 to get licensed — and skipping driver’s ed because they couldn’t afford it,” Baldwin said. “This bill is going to fix that.”
Measuring progress, facing uncertainty
Even as the state steps up its efforts, Baldwin says Washington’s ability to maintain momentum is tied to fragile federal funding. Her agency relies on federal dollars for 80% of its budget, including enforcement and education programs.
“We’re in this era of great uncertainty about federal funding,” she said. “Even the number of federal employees that are leaving — our regional office was cut in half. So not only am I worried about whether or not I’m going to get the funding, I’m worried about whether or not I’ll have the support to pay our bills.”
Despite the challenges, Baldwin remains focused on what she sees as achievable progress — through policy, design, data, and conversation.
“It just is within our grasp,” she said. “We could have the safest summer ever.”

Process is mandated every five years, but this one comes charged with new court ruling that Wyoming is violating state constitution by short-changing public education.
The post In shadow of court ruling, Wyoming begins to ‘recalibrate’ public school funding appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming lawmakers have launched the state’s 2025 school recalibration, an exhaustive and tedious assessment of public education funding mandated every five years. 
This time, however, they are doing so in the shadow of a district court ruling that the Wyoming Legislature violated the state’s constitution by underfunding public education and must amend that. 
The new ruling loomed large during the Legislature’s Select Committee on School Finance Recalibration’s two-day meeting in Casper this week. 
Due to the court decision, school finance consultant Dr. Larry Picus told the committee, “we really recommended that probably all of the elements [of Wyoming’s model] needed to at least be looked at as part of the recalibration, so that’s what we intend to do.”
Picus’ team has been enlisted to lead the assessment — the sixth recalibration he’s worked on for Wyoming. For this one, he said, the court ruling has also spurred his team to bring in additional experts on issues such as teacher pay. The judge determined some of the past state-hired experts on public school funding had “diminished credibility.”
The recalibration effort, which will entail more than a dozen meetings and a thorough look at everything from student-to-teacher ratios to school lunches, will shape what public education looks like in Wyoming into the future.

Though the byzantine and laborious endeavor could make it easy to ignore, public interest is high this year. On Tuesday, the Casper meeting room was packed with people, including many affiliated with Better Wyoming, a nonprofit that encourages civic action. Many attendees — galvanized into action by a Republican lawmaker’s online statement — urged the committee not to underfund public education.  
“We are asking you as elected officials, as stewards of the public good and as human beings to fully fund public education, to meet your constitutional duty obligations,” said retired teacher Robyn Edwards, “because without a robust public school, our small towns will unravel, our communities will erode, and our children, especially those in poverty, will be more vulnerable to falling through the cracks.” 
What is it? 
The recalibration process is required every five years to ensure the Legislature fulfills its constitutional duty to “provide for the establishment and maintenance of a complete and uniform system of public instruction.” 
It basically entails “asking what do schools look like to be successful, what do they need to be successful and what that costs,” Picus told the committee.  
To do that, consultants will hold meetings with Wyoming educators, analyze data and make recommendations over the course of several months. 
This year, they will be doing so with the February court ruling in mind. The ruling, which the state is appealing, is the latest in a string of court cases that have further delineated the state’s education obligations.

In his 186-page ruling, Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher found the Legislature failed to properly fund the “basket of quality educational goods and services,” that the Wyoming Supreme Court in 1995 ordered lawmakers to set, update and fund every two years. The judge also found the state failed to properly adjust funding for inflation; failed to provide funding for adequate salaries for teachers and staff; and failed to provide sufficient funding for mental health counselors, school safety resource officers, nutritional programs and computers for students. Lawmakers have failed as well to properly assess school buildings for “educational suitability,” and have allowed inadequate facilities to exist for too long without repair or replacement, he ruled. 
The recalibration, he added, makes for “an excellent window of opportunity to address these issues.”
Emerging issues
In a preliminary audit, consultants identified issues that most need to be recalibrated this time around: “educational personnel salaries — which many in Wyoming argue are too low; pupil teacher ratios at the secondary level; adjustments for inflation and regional cost differences; educational technology; and the number of mental health professionals in schools.”
School resource officers and school nutrition programs in particular “also need to be considered in the 2025 recalibration,” the audit states.
During two days of presentations and testimony before the recalibration committee in Casper, many echoed these concerns. School officials repeatedly told committee members that teacher pay in Wyoming has not kept up, a fact that’s hurting the public education system and contributing to a teacher shortage.

“The price of labor has changed over time. Our model hasn’t,” Johnson County resident Travis Pearson told the committee. “If we adjust that model base pay … That’ll straighten out almost all of the issues” identified. 
The message on teacher pay was consistent as a number of curriculum directors, superintendents and special education directors testified. Wyoming, they said, is losing out to neighboring states because it doesn’t pay as well comparatively as it once did. 
Sen. Wendy Schuler, R-Evanston, a former teacher herself, said she remembers when Wyoming was consistently among the top states for teacher salaries. “We’ve dropped considerably,” she said. 
During sessions held with school staff and experts so far, Picus said, that sentiment was also clear. “There was a consistent view that the salary levels are too low.”
Educators also testified about high insurance costs, the need to supplement school lunch programs, growing mental and behavioral health needs and career-and-technical-education resources. 
Legislative duty
This recalibration comes at a time when lawmakers have been expressing growing interest in cutting spending and promoting private education alternatives. That has led to rising public concern. 
Wyoming passed a new universal school voucher program this spring that gives up to $7,000 for private school costs, for example. Many worry this will lead to an exodus from public schools and result in smaller funding pools. That voucher program was challenged last week in court. 
The state also passed a roughly 25% reduction in property taxes, which will lead to declining mill levy revenues for local school districts, among other things.

A Facebook conversation about those tax reductions helped motivate the Better Wyoming crowd to show up in Casper. In that post, former state lawmaker Scott Clem asked how the Legislature plans “to cut education by 50-80M annually to pay for the 25% permanent tax cut exemption, especially in light of the legislature being 0-6 in the courts for not adequately funding education.” 
“Recalibration,” Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, answered. 
Potential actions like that, Better Wyoming Executive Director Nate Martin said, have people worried. 
“Our public school system is a major driver of our state’s economy,” Martin said. “And there’s also a growing perception that some of the people who are tasked with upholding and supporting a complete and uniform system of public instruction per the constitution are instead working to undermine it.”
The Legislature’s recalibration job, Rural Wyoming Matters Executive Director Joey Correnti testified, is nuanced and complicated. It is also, he added, “not to take a chainsaw to the budget.”

(Photo by Mikaila Kraus/For Oklahoma Voice)EDMOND — It’s not unusual to see a line snaking its way down the hallway leading to the entrance of a small room tucked inside the University of Central Oklahoma’s student union.
The university’s students and employees wait in those long lines to choose items like nonperishable food staples such as beans, rice and canned goods from neatly labeled shelves. But unlike the grocery store, these shelves have no price tags and the items are free to UCO students and employees who need them. 
Organizers say the Central Pantry’s small size belies an outsized mission. It has helped feed hundreds of UCO students and employees since it became the state’s first college food pantry to open its doors in 2012.
Nicole Doherty, the director of community engagement at UCO and director of Central Pantry, says there is a common misconception that anyone who can afford to attend college must be able to afford food. 
“Which is just not the reality as we see every day on our campus and many other campuses in Oklahoma,” Doherty said. 
College students aren’t usually the first group that comes to mind when people think of hunger, but about 3.8 million experienced food insecurity in 2020, according to an analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. A 2020 Temple University survey found that 50% of college students could not afford to eat balanced meals, and 35% missed meals because they couldn’t afford them, said Austin Prickett, a spokesman for the Oklahoma Regional Food Bank. The organization serves more than 1,300 food pantries across central and western Oklahoma, according to their website. 
“You could just be scraping by and the money that you pay for your tuition is all you have,” Prickett said. “That doesn’t mean they’re fully skipping every meal, it could just be, I can only eat breakfast today, so that’s not a full balanced diet”. 
Prickett said many college students suffer from low-level food insecurity, which means they may be eating everyday but are not getting enough to maintain a healthy diet.
“That’s why the pantries are there,” Prickett said. “We want them to be there to help folks get by, and we know also that if you’re not eating a well-balanced diet and eating all your meals, it’s going to make it a lot harder to pay attention to class and to get through your college work.”

Community support
There are 19 college food pantries in Oklahoma that are affiliates of the Regional Food Bank. Affiliate food banks can purchase food items from The Regional Food Bank at a significantly cheaper cost than if they were buying the items from a store. The Regional Food Bank assigns donors to college food pantries, such as local supermarkets, so that pantries have a ready supply of food available. 
Food pantries try to provide students with the items that they need to have a nutritious, balanced diet, Prickett said. The Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma has nutritionists on staff and will award pantries that meet the criteria a Healthy Pantry Certification. The Healthy Pantry Certification shows that a pantry provides good nutritional products such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Currently, 5 of the 19 college food pantries in Oklahoma have this certification. 
“A lot of people come in and they might see, for instance, vegetables. They might see a vegetable and say, ‘What is this? I’ve never seen this before, And it’s a turnip, right?’ And so I said, ‘Oh, well this is what you can do for turnips. You can mash it like a mashed potato. You can do this.’ So we also have recipe cards because we are a healthy pantry with the Regional Food Bank. We’ve put together several different little cookbooks,” said Monique Bruner, the president of the Campus Resource Center at Rose State College.
Bruner said the Campus Resource Center serves an average of about 200 students a week. Bruner, who created the food pantry in 2018, said she was moved to do so when a student confided in her that they only received $70 in food stamps for a month’s worth of groceries. 
“I thought, I wonder how many other people are out there that just need a little help,” Bruner said. 
Bruner said funding for the food pantry initially came from private donations, but as more support was given to the project, eventually the student senate at Rose State voted for a portion of student activity fees to be allocated to the pantry’s budget. Bruner also applies for grants to supplement the pantry’s expenses, which has made additions such as a storage shed possible.
“If I hadn’t got that grant we would not have had the money to get a storage building,” Bruner said.
‘A lot of personal experience’
A common problem that college food pantries have is keeping high-demand items in stock. These include peanut butter, pasta, meat products, frozen products, rice, and eggs. 
Brian Blevins, the coordinator for Basic Needs Resources at Oklahoma State University, said that his desire to help create a food pantry there came from his time working at Central Pantry at UCO and his own personal experiences with food insecurity. 
“I’ve had a lot of personal experience, I’ve had a lot of professional experience, and Oklahoma is also a pretty hungry state, so there’s a lot of work to be done,” Blevins said. 
College food pantries often struggle with a lack of space. Having to store items like meat and cheese means that freezers and refrigerators are needed. In addition, the storage needed to store nonperishable items can make college food pantries cramped. 
Doherty, with UCO’s food pantry, said it has been a long term goal of hers to find a larger space for Central Pantry. Doherty said that she has applied for many different spaces on UCO’S campus over the years, but none of them have been approved by the university. 
“The people that are shopping in the pantry are already experiencing a frustration or a roadblock in their world,” said Doherty. “We want to provide a space that people feel comfortable and welcome in.”

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Over 100 state and local officials from the Midwest and West, including Iowa, are asking the U.S. Senate to eliminate tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration as part of a federal budget reconciliation bill.
Established by Congress and then-President George W. Bush in 2008, the 45Q tax credits incentivize companies to capture carbon dioxide from processes such as ethanol production and sequester it underground, so it won’t contribute to climate change by acting as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The carbon can also be sequestered as part of enhanced oil recovery, in which pressurized gas is used to push more oil to the surface.
Opponents say the credits don’t work as intended.
“The 45Q tax credits really only make sense to the industries that are poised to make billions of dollars from them,” said North Dakota state Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo. “They are supposedly intended to reduce carbon emissions, but in fact, 45Q tax credits pay polluters for polluting and subsidize private oil production at the expense of the taxpayer.”
Companies receive up to $85 per metric ton for regular sequestration and up to $60 per metric ton for sequestration via enhanced oil recovery — though there is a provision in a draft portion of the Senate reconciliation bill that would raise the maximum oil recovery credit to $85.
The repeal effort includes 27 officials from Iowa, as well as officials from Colorado, Indiana, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. A few of those officials held a virtual press conference Wednesday.
South Dakota state Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, described the tax credits as wasteful spending.
“We are concerned about preserving taxpayer dollars, and that’s the main gist of our conference today,” Hohn said.
Mathern said repealing the tax credits would put projects like Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed five-state carbon dioxide pipeline “in dire danger.”
“And that’s really positive,” he said.

Summit’s project alone could qualify for more than $1 billion annually from 45Q credits. It aims to capture some of the CO2 emitted by dozens of ethanol plants and ship the carbon via pipeline to a sequestration area southeast of the oilfields in western North Dakota.
Earlier this year, South Dakota’s legislators and governor adopted a law banning the use of a legal process known as eminent domain to acquire land access for carbon dioxide pipelines. South Dakota regulators also rejected Summit’s project application, saying there was no path forward for the project under the eminent domain ban.
Those moves came after several years of anti-pipeline activism by landowners focused on property rights and the danger from potential leaks of toxic carbon dioxide plumes. The project has permits in other states, but some of those are being challenged in court.
Congressional Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move a budget package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. The House recently passed its version of the bill without a repeal of the 45Q tax credits. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, voted for the bill.
A spokesperson for Johnson sent a statement when asked via email if the congressman supports repealing the tax credits: “While Dusty wished the reconciliation bill was more conservative, he voted in favor of it when it passed the House. We’ll see what the Senate passes.”
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, said Rounds met with a group of South Dakota lawmakers when they traveled to D.C. to voice opposition to the 45Q tax credits.
“Senator Rounds has long held the belief that many industry specific tax credits should not be perpetual, a belief which this group of landowners shares,” the statement said. “However, he has not had a chance to hear details of President Trump’s interest in this program. While many in South Dakota may oppose 45Q, it has been a popular proposal for other states for almost two decades and was included in the House-passed reconciliation bill.”
The office of Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, sent a similar reply that did not disclose his position on the tax credits.
“As congressional Republicans work with President Trump to pass legislation that will create long-term strength, safety, and prosperity for America, Sen. Thune appreciated the opportunity to meet with and hear firsthand from state legislators who have been on the front lines of this issue.”
Anti-pipeline activists are also concerned about a provision in an early draft of the House budget reconciliation bill that they said would have allowed federal regulators to approve natural gas and carbon dioxide pipelines over prohibitions in state law. That provision was removed before the bill passed the House. The rest of the statement from Thune’s office appeared to address that issue: “He understands their concerns, and he conveyed that the provision removed by the House is unlikely to be included in the final bill.”

BURLINGTON — Sailing on Lake Champlain on a beautiful evening was an “uplifting” experience for Roshaunda McLean who recently moved to Vermont from Chicago.
She and her husband have been on the water before but this wasn’t like boating off the busy Lake Michigan shore.
“It felt like we were the only people on the water,” said McLean, 33, who was among a group of Black Vermonters coming off two classic sailing sloops — the Wild Rose and the Friend Ship — behind the ECHO Center at the Burlington waterfront Wednesday evening.
McLean experienced one of the six sails organized for Black Vermonters this week to commemorate Juneteenth, which marks the day in 1865 when Union soldiers arrived in Texas and told enslaved African Americans of their freedom, more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation.
“This is often the first thing they say they’ve done in community in Burlington,” said 
Ferene Paris, a Black resident and entrepreneur who created the Juneteenth sails five years ago, in partnership with the Whistling Man Schooner Company, to make sailing accessible to the Black community.
Many who set sail yesterday said the event is the highlight of their Juneteenth festivities this year. Often called America’s second independence day, Juneteenth marks the end of slavery in the United States. It was declared a federal holiday in 2021 and is a state holiday in Vermont as of this year with several events planned across the state.
Black freedom, however, can be a loaded concept for some in the U.S. and in Vermont, the third whitest state in the nation. Paris said she left her university job due to a toxic culture and systemic racism, issues many Black professionals continue to face here. While sailing and water sports are popular in the Green Mountain State, they remain largely white activities, often seen as elitist and exclusionary by communities of color.
That’s something Paris is hoping to change.

First wind
Paris said she was nervous when she quit her university job in 2020 and started a business — All Heart Inspirations. But she also wanted to celebrate. 
A graduate student suggested a sail with a local company and Paris was intrigued.
It was June 2020 and the world was dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic so she wondered how a group sail would work. She messaged the Whistling Man Schooner Company, bought a picnic basket, donned a mask and hopped on board a classic sailing sloop downtown.
“It was so peaceful. I didn’t realize how much my mental health would enjoy the openness of the water, and what that would feel like,”  said Paris, who has struggled with anxiety and depression.
When Black and brown communities do come together, she added, it’s often a reaction to suffering and anchored in pain. That first sail felt soft, she said. It felt like something she deserved. It felt so good she teared up. 
It’s not something most Black Vermonters have the privilege of experiencing, she admitted. 

“You don’t get this unless you have access to a vessel to put you on the water. And not a lot of folks who look like me are doing this,” she said.
Originally from Haiti, Paris has fond memories of the community and care she grew up with where it was literally a village that raised her. She wanted to create that in Vermont. And she wanted to recreate what she felt during her first sail. So she did.
In partnership with the sailboat company, Paris created the Juneteenth sails in 2020.
“It’s been a wonderful thing,” said Cory Dalsimer, owner of the sailing company.
Paris sets an intention for each sail telling participants to leave the stress behind in what is “the perfect complement to the sailing experience.” She’s a true professional and the people who do the Juneteenth cruises “really leave refreshed,” he said.

Setting sail
Now in its fifth year, the event has helped more than 250 Black Vermonters experience the lightness and wonder she felt when she first went out on Lake Champlain. 
Out on the lake for the first time Wednesday, Stephanie Holden, 39, from Essex Junction, said it was an incredible experience, not just to be out on the water on a beautiful evening but to be surrounded by other Black Vermonters and find how much they have in common. “That was very surprising,” she said, and quite the “freeing experience.”
Paired with storytelling and snacks in community, the event has become an annual tradition for Danila Dinan of Burlington, also from Haiti, who enjoyed her third Juneteenth sail this week.

“I love coming to this because it’s wonderful to see other LGBTQ and Black folks on board,” she said. It’s been a great way to meet new friends in a shared experience that “warms your heart.”
As one group came off the dock at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, another group was preparing to board. They were quick to greet each other and were soon sharing contact information, hugs and joy.
Among them were former city councilor Zoraya Hightower, former gubernatorial candidate Esther Charlestin and Harmony Edosomwan who runs a popular soul food popup and catering business – Harmony’s Kitchen. 
Wearing a sash that read Miss Black Vermont, Edosomwan from Winooski, was invited by Paris to host the second boat yesterday. 
“I’m really excited. It’s a beautiful evening and I’m happy to be a part of it,” she said, stopping to pose for photos with some of the participants. “I think Ferene is doing a great thing trying to bring the community together and supporting local businesses.”
Paris partners with local businesses to raise funds for the sails, which in turn benefits a local organization. This year, the money raised from the Juneteenth sails, after costs, will be donated to the Richard Kemp Center in Burlington, Vermont’s first community center for people of color that is run by Black and brown Vermonters. She hopes others who support the sails will donate to the center too.
For Paris, her work as a Black woman and storyteller has always been about community and “holding space.” She sees the annual event as a mutual aid initiative connecting and supporting local Black businesses.
“When I think about the climate right now, people are looking for spaces where they can just be. And it’s always been my value to do that with All Heart Inspirations,” she said. “I got you. Be on the water with me. You, yourself. We give food, we give drinks. … If all you can do is just get yourself down to the waterfront, we got you. And I don’t think we have that enough in this community. We got you.”

Meredith’s chance to be nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022 was tanked by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican. Biden abandoned his plans to nominate Meredith after Paul vowed to block his confirmation in the Senate.
This time Paul is supporting Meredith, the Associated Press reports.
Meredith, the son of state Sen. Stephen Merdith, R-Leitchfield, is a partner in the law firm Squire Patton Boggs.
He served as Kentucky’s solicitor general from 2019 to 2021 when Cameron was attorney general and before that as chief deputy counsel in Bevin’s administration.
As part of Bevin’s legal team, Meredith was involved in decisions about hundreds of controversial criminal pardons and commutations Bevin issued after losing reelection to Democrat Andy Beshear in 2019. Among those pardoned was a man convicted of reckless homicide during a robbery whose family had held a fundraiser for Bevin. 
In his prior roles, Meredith also defended laws and policies restricting abortion, a record that drew loud objections from Democrats when Biden considered nominating him. At that time Meredith had the enthusiastic support of Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, then the Senate’s Republican leader. 
On Thursday the Kentucky Democratic Party issued a statement criticizing the nomination and highlighting Meredith’s role in Bevin’s pardons. “Chad Meredith has no business being on the federal bench after helping orchestrate pardons of murderers and child rapists.”
After graduating from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 2007, Meredith clerked for Judge John M. Rogers on the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals and also for Judge Amul R. Thapar, now a federal  appeals court judge, when he was a judge in Kentucky’s Eastern District.

It’s lunch time, and she’s surrounded by other campers who are busy digging into french fries and stuffed-crust pizza. 
Jeffries is taking part in the recreational summer camp, and though it’s her first day, she said she’s already making friends.
“ I like how we get to cook and stuff. We get to learn about each other. We get to do new things every day,” Jeffries said.

Stewpot Community Services is one of Jackson’s main meal kitchens and provider of shelters for people experiencing homelessness. Jeffries is one of about 150 children who are here for the summer camp, and she said spending time at Stewpot allows her the chance to do something other than being at home. 
“ It gives me time to breathe,” she said. “I get to relax and I don’t have to worry about anything happening here. I get to cook stuff. I get to enjoy myself.”
Yolanda Kirkland, Stewpot’s director of teen services, said that’s the point. She hopes to cultivate a welcoming environment where her campers can be comfortable.
“ It’s very important that people have places of rest,” Kirkland said. “I think when they’re in a place where they are loved, they can rest.”
Stewpot has held summer camps for children in west Jackson for more than 30 years. The seven week program is designed for students who are in kindergarten through 10th grade. Here, children from underprivileged communities can go on excursions with peers and take part in educational opportunities, such as weeklong camps at the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science and biology lessons in the garden behind the Teen Center. 
On this day, volunteers from Brilla Soccer Ministry are teaching a group of middle schoolers the basics of soccer, while others are headed to the Two Mississippi Museums. The next day, the teenagers will be headed to Spinners roller rink in nearby Florence for skating or the Margaret Walker Alexander Library. There’s a well-rounded calendar of activities which keeps them social while also opening their worldview.
“ I want the kids to know they do have a rich community in Mississippi,” Kirkland said. “Some of our students stay in one location. They stay around their neighborhoods. I try to expose them to what’s in Mississippi. I want them to know what they have in their state that’s unique.”
That includes trips all across the state, such as the Grammy Museum in Cleveland or the Biedenharn Coca-Cola Museum in Vicksburg. 
“We go everywhere if I can get there in our little mini-bus,” Kirkland said. “If I can get there and get back for 3:00, we’re gone.”

Verse Norris, a rising eighth grader, said he finds the summer camp fun because she’s introduced to something new every day.
“It is adventurous. You never know what could happen,” Norris said. “They take you somewhere fun and there’s a lot of other things to do, like cooking and gardening. You just do more stuff than you can at your normal summer camp.”
But Stewpot’s summer camp isn’t just about having fun. Nearby, in a building adjacent to the Teen Center, LaQuita White helps a young camper attach yarn to a craft project. Today, they’re learning about summer fruits. 
“Some of our kids don’t usually have things to do in the summer, and our camp keeps them engaged and thriving because we also do learning,” said White, director of children’s services at Stewpot.  “We do summer reading. We do STEM activities. We do a little math because we have JPS tutors who come weekly and do different educational activities with them.”
Studies have shown that children are at risk of losing vital reading and math skills during the summer months when they aren’t in school. Children who come from lower-income households, like many of the children that Stewpot serves, may find themselves at a greater disadvantage. 
“We are here for them, because some of our parents can’t afford to send them to a seven week summer camp, and so if we were not here, they’d probably more than likely just be sitting at home or at grandma’s house with nothing to do. No learning going on, no reading,” she said. 
White said that she wants her campers to thrive and grow, even as they age out of her program and into the teen group and beyond.
“Our big thing here is graduation. That’s the name of the game,” White said. “Educate, motivate, graduate. That’s our motto.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12171450/Stewpot-summer-camp-11.jpg,,,2025-06-19 15:04:56.377900
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-19 17:45:43+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT DOC delayed man’s treatment as cancer worsened, suit claims",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/19/ct-doc-cancer-lawsuit/,A Bridgeport resident says the CT DOC's failure to provide timely treatment led to 28 rounds of chemotherapy and the removal of his bladder.,"A Bridgeport resident has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Correction, alleging that the department failed to provide timely treatment for his cancer, resulting in the need for multiple rounds of chemotherapy and the removal of his bladder, lymph nodes and prostate. 
Glenn London, 61, entered Bridgeport Correctional Center in January 2023 for a nonviolent crime. During an intake exam with the prison’s medical department, he informed them that he had been seen at the VA medical center because he was urinating blood. The center, he said, had advised him to follow up with the urologist and mentioned a possibility of bladder cancer.  
But in the months that followed, London claims, the Department of Correction failed to get adequate treatment for him. When he was finally brought to the University of Connecticut Health Center in August 2023, they found a cancerous mass the size of a golf ball, according to the lawsuit. 
London spoke about his case at a press conference earlier this month, where Barbara Fair, the executive director of Stop Solitary CT, referred to him as someone who had experienced medical neglect first-hand within the Department of Correction. 
During the same press conference, London’s attorney, Ken Krayeske, referenced the legislature’s failure to compel Connecticut’s Department of Correction to release an independent report on some of the worst medical malpractice and neglect cases that happened in its custody.
“ We have an emergency room physician who has filed a good faith certificate with us explaining that what happened to Glenn was unconscionable. And this happened six years after we have the cancer cases of Wayne World and Billy Bennett and Patsy Camara,” Krayeske said at the press conference.
Waiting for appointments
London said he asked the staff at the Bridgeport Correctional Center if he could see a doctor when he first entered, in January 2023. But in the three days he was at the facility before posting bail, he wasn’t given any medical attention. 
In March, London went back into Bridgeport Correctional Center. He told The Connecticut Mirror that he’d been waiting since January to get an appointment through the VA medical center. The appointment he’d gotten, he said, was in March, and his incarceration made it impossible for him to go. 
According to the lawsuit, London had told medical staff at the Correctional Center in late March that he’d been urinating blood and asked to go to the emergency room. The medical staff suggested he drink more water. 
The following day, London went to court, where he asked the judge to have him brought to the emergency room. At the ER, he was told to follow up with a urologist within two weeks. But he was never sent for an appointment, the lawsuit claims. 
At his next court appearance in April, London again asked to be transported to the emergency room. The bleeding was getting worse, and London told CT Mirror that urinating was painful. This time, medical staff advised him to follow up with a urologist within two days. Once again, the request went ignored, according to the lawsuit. 
London said the Department of Correction did make an appointment for him to see a urologist but failed to first send him to have scans taken, meaning that the doctor was not able to make any treatment recommendations. After that appointment, which took place in April, the DOC made no further appointments for him, according to a grievance he filed in July. 
The Department of Correction responded that they had scheduled an appointment for London on July 11, which they said he refused — a claim that London disputes. 
It wasn’t until August 2023, when London was sentenced and transported to Carl Robinson Correctional Institution, that he was finally sent to UConn Medical Center, where, according to London, doctors discovered a mass in his bladder “as big as a golf ball.” The cancer was diagnosed as Stage 3A. 
“I was praying hard,” London said. “ It may not be a death threat, but I was really concerned. My children were concerned. I thought it was going to take me out, to be honest.” 
28 rounds of chemotherapy
London’s daughter, Karen London, who works as a patient care coordinator, said it was difficult for her, as someone working in the medical field, to not be able to advocate for her father. Finding out that the mass was cancer, she said, was a shock. She said she worried that her father might not get the best care. She also said it was difficult to get information about his condition and that she wasn’t able to be present while he was in chemotherapy. 
“I wasn’t able to be by his bedside during those treatments. There wasn’t any by-your-side. There wasn’t any emotional support for him, because I wasn’t able to be there,” she said. 
London ended up going through more than 28 rounds of chemotherapy, during which time he stayed at the medical unit at Osborn Correctional Institution. After being released on transitional supervision — similar to parole — in January 2024, he underwent a nine-hour surgery that March to remove his bladder, prostate and lymph nodes. 
He now lives with a urology bag, which he said limits his day-to-day mobility and causes a lot of emotional pain.  
“I can’t pick up my grandson in a normal way that any grandfather would want to pick him up,” he said. 
Karen London added that the idea that her father had to wear a urology bag was something she had to get used to. 
“My dad is one of those guys, he takes pride in his appearance, he’s a very sharp man. So knowing that he now had to walk around with a bag to urinate from mentally was just — wow. It was a shocker,” she said.  
London is asking for $10 million in monetary relief. 
He said the real goal of the lawsuit was to ensure that other inmates in the Department of Correction don’t have to go through the same difficulties. He referenced the death of a man held in Bridgeport Correctional about six months prior to London’s first incarceration there. According to a report, the man died after not receiving the proper care for his ALS and opiate withdrawal. 
Krayeske, London’s attorney, said that he’s litigated multiple cases against the Department of Correction — including the case of Wayne World, whose skin cancer was repeatedly misdiagnosed by the Department of Correction, and Karon Nealy Jr., a 19-year-old who died from lupus. Generally, the people whom he represents have already died in custody. 
“Glenn is a gifted speaker. It is not often that I have clients who can talk about what they experienced,” Krayeske told CT Mirror. 
Krayeske said he hoped that having someone who survived the inadequate care they received in the Department of Correction would spur changes within the system.
“I want a judge to hear what the state put Glenn through,” he said. 
Andrius Banevicius, public information officer for the Department of Correction, said the department does not comment on pending litigation.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9094-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-19 14:08:36.469971

WILMINGTON — The Sunday Breakfast Mission (SBM) held a ribbon-cutting ceremony Tuesday to celebrate the dedication of two newly rehabilitated homes aimed at supporting individuals transitioning out of homelessness.
The homes, developed in partnership with Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County, will serve as transitional housing for SBM’s New Life Discipleship Program graduates and its interns through the Aftercare II program. The initiative offers residents one to two years of stable housing while they pursue goals such as completing education or saving for a home.

“This is something we want to see happen not just here, but around the nation,” said Sunday Breakfast Mission President and Senior Pastor Rev. Tom Laymon. 
Two additional houses on the same block are currently under construction for future participants, with building efforts led by The Challenge Program.
“We’re setting it up for interns to come here and live in one of these houses as well and begin to learn what happens here at Sunday Breakfast Mission and be able to take it back to another rescue mission across the United States,” Laymon said. 


The marks a milestone in cross-sector collaboration between faith-based organizations, nonprofits, and local leaders. Habitat for Humanity served as the general contractor for the housing renovations, an emerging role that the organization hopes to expand with similar partners.
“This created an opportunity for us to pilot being a general contractor for other nonprofits,” said Kevin Smith, CEO of Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County. 
Mayor John Carney, who attended the event, praised the effort as a model for meaningful collaboration.
“The only way to make progress is through very solid, committed partnerships,” Carney said. “And what I think about those partnerships that we have here in Wilmington, and the ones that I see right in front of me—we’re really set up to make real progress at so many levels.”

We live in a time when institutions with the honesty and integrity to tell difficult historical truths are bullied by those who seek to paper over our past. 
The post As we mark Juneteenth, don’t let Trump’s cuts to vital cultural institutions whitewash history appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","I GREW UP under the unflinching eyes of my great-great-great-grandfather, William Lloyd Garrison, a fierce abolitionist who reshaped America’s moral conscience on slavery.
A portrait of him held a place of pride in my grandfather’s house in Lincoln, and my parents took every opportunity to point out the Olin Levi Warner statue on the Commonwealth Avenue Mall in Boston that honors his life of service. Juneteenth, marking the end of slavery in the United States, is a fitting moment to reflect on what his story means in my life. 
I am proud of my family’s legacy, and I am proud to be a lifelong resident of Massachusetts, a state that has been a vanguard of liberty and justice since the birth of our great nation. I believe we have a responsibility to nurture a rich connection with our past as we work to create a better future. That’s why I was outraged to learn that in April the federal government began terminating Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) grants, an essential source of funding for arts and educational institutions that preserve and elevate that historical connection. 
 In light of this shortsighted and destructive choice, we the people must step up. Our nonprofit institutions need us, just as we need them.

My support starts with the Museum of African American History | Boston & Nantucket, which has had $500,000 in IMLS funding, originally awarded last June, rescinded. This is a major loss for an institution with an annual operating budget of $3 million. The termination of this grant forced the museum to reallocate resources towards fundraising efforts and reimagine the development of programming offered at the museum’s landmark sites.  
I first discovered this cultural treasure when I, along with hundreds of other descendants of William Lloyd Garrison, convened in 2005 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of his birth. We visited the museum, toured Garrison’s house in Roxbury, and traced his footsteps through the many famous corners of the city he called home during his fight against injustice.  
All through my childhood, I had gathered tidbits about Garrison from family members, but my first deep look at his life came in middle school when I read All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery by Henry Mayer, a book my mother shared with me. I was engrossed, learning how Garrison was famed for his unwavering demand that slavery be abolished immediately and unconditionally.  
This view, radical at the time, was unwelcome among the rich and powerful who wanted at most slow, gradual emancipation. Garrison himself favored gradual emancipation at first until he attended a life-changing meeting at the African Meeting House on Joy Street in Boston’s Beacon Hill neighborhood, now one of four sites under the museum’s care. At this gathering, he listened and understood that emancipation cannot wait until it is convenient for those in power. That urgent message became his clarion call. 
Garrison, a white abolitionist, stood strong in the face of threats and criticism. In 1831 in Boston he founded The Liberator newspaper, recognized for its uncompromising stance of immediate abolition. A year later, he launched the New England Anti-Slavery Society from that very same Meeting House.  
At age 30, Garrison’s fiery appeals for justice nearly cost him his life when a lynch mob of so-called “gentlemen” chased him to his office in what is now Government Center. Thankfully, the sheriff placed him in protective custody until the crowd dispersed. Despite threats like these, he never retreated a single inch from his principles. 
In 1865, the United States abolished slavery, but the scars and fault lines of racism remain. When American white nationalists tried to host a rally on Boston Common in 2017, I joined tens of thousands of others in a boisterous counterdemonstration.  
Today, rich and powerful people again want to silence voices they dislike and attenuate our connection to the lessons of history. My family and I strengthen that connection through support of the Museum of African American History I Boston & Nantucket.  
The African Meeting House, built in 1806 by free African American artisans as a sacred space and part of the museum complex on Beacon Hill, is sacred for us too. We are humbly grateful to the museum for its work to uplift the stories of agitators and advocates like William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, Wendell Phillips, and Sarah Grimke. We show our support as members and with donations of time and family artifacts. 
Since news of the IMLS grant termination became public, elected officials have spoken out, and citizens of every age and background have become members and made donations. Still, this moment calls for more. 
We live in a time when institutions with the honesty and integrity to tell difficult historical truths are bullied by those who seek to whitewash our past. I urge residents of our Commonwealth to join the Garrison family in supporting this museum — and all cultural institutions that face these challenges — and to take courage from the stories these institutions help illuminate. 
Garth Griffin has served on the board of directors of the Museum of African American History | Boston & Nantucket since 2020. He is the co-founder and chief technology officer of the tech startup Gigasheet.

The Mississippi State Board of Education voted Thursday to remove the requirement starting this fall. 
Department officials reiterated at the meeting that high schoolers would still have to take and pass history classes to graduate. 
Paula Vanderford, the education department’s chief accountability officer, said the agency has informally discussed releasing test resources to local districts if they want to create their own assessments. 
She said at a previous board meeting that getting rid of the test would save the state money.
The state board voted to open public comments about the decision in April after the Commission on School Accreditation voted to propose eliminating the test. Ultimately, it received 20 comments in support of the test’s removal, many of them from parents who cited their children’s test anxiety, and 16 against it, arguing that getting rid of the test would diminish the importance of the country’s history. 
U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker recently co-authored an editorial advocating against removing the U.S. history state test with board member Mary Werner, who voted against the decision at the meeting. 
“Our state has been making remarkable strides in education, and this progress is equipping the very Mississippians who will lead our state into the 21st century,” the editorial reads. “As they take on our future, we believe they should be as knowledgeable as possible about our past.”
Passing the state algebra I, biology and English language arts tests will remain a graduation requirement. The U.S. history assessment was the sole test not required by state or federal law. 
“Though the U.S. history statewide assessment will be eliminated starting next school year, it’s important to emphasize that students will still learn U.S. history and will be required to successfully complete the course to graduate,” said Dr. Lance Evans, state superintendent of education, in a press release. “Having fewer state tests required to graduate should be less taxing on educators, students and families alike.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/07024100/Teacher-Shortage8.jpg,,,2025-06-19 13:16:19.657703

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)Bishop Craig Coates doesn’t want to name names.
But, the organizer of Annapolis’ annual Juneteenth celebration said, eight of the event’s main sponsors have dropped their support for the two-day event this year. In total, Coates said the festival and parade lost about $150,000 in sponsorships and federal grant money.
This is the first time the celebration has ever faced a decrease in funding from the previous year, he said. To cover the losses, Coates has had to rely on community support and individual donations to fund the $185,000 project.
“We were so dependent upon our relationships we built,” Coates said. “It was just so shocking and disheartening when you’re getting these declines in the email.”
Though most didn’t say it outright, Coates said he could “read between the lines” that the sponsors’ decisions to cancel their support stemmed from the cuts to and dismantling of DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — programs.
But Coates worked to keep the funding cuts from dampening the celebration. It expanded from one day to two, and he expects about 3,000 people will attend the parade in downtown Annapolis on Saturday and more than 12,000 will come to the festival at the Anne Arundel County Fairgrounds.
“We’ve had hardships before, and yet in the midst of it, we celebrated,” he said. “We won’t put the spotlight on what’s been cut, but what we’re able to do despite those challenges.”
Annapolis Juneteenth’s financial struggles are not unique. Many Juneteenth celebrations across the country have been forced to scale back as they face decreased corporate sponsorships and lowered government support.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Still, not all events have fared as Annapolis has. Organizers of other Juneteenth celebrations across the state, from the National Harbor to the Eastern Shore, said their events have remained steady — or even gained more support than last year.
Lauren Fells, the marketing content manager at National Harbor and the organizer of its Juneteenth celebration, said the event has gained sponsors this year.
After starting with just one sponsor for the first event in 2022, Fells said this year’s celebration gained three more, including Ben & Jerry’s and the MGM National Harbor. She expects between 500 and 1,000 people will attend the event Thursday.
“Every year seems to be where more people are interested in really wanting to make sure that they are a part of the community, and they reach out through these types of cultural events,” Fells said.
Juneteenth, the nation’s newest federal holiday, is celebrated on June 19 each year and honors the ending of slavery in the U.S. The date commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger led troops to Galveston, Texas, where they delivered the news that the Civil War had ended and the enslaved were free.
After more than 150 years without nationwide recognition, former U.S. President Joe Biden declared Juneteenth a federal holiday in 2021.
Makya Purnell, the president and co-founder of Eastern Shore Juneteenth, said the celebration has grown significantly since the organization’s first event in 2018. After starting in a cultural center’s backyard, the organization hosts its parade and festival in downtown Salisbury.
While the celebration on Saturday has three fewer sponsors this year, Purnell said she didn’t know whether there was a political reason for their lack of support or not. Overall, she said the event has remained steady.
Purnell said larger events which rely on corporate sponsors may have been more impacted than celebrations like Eastern Shore Juneteenth, as its sponsors are primarily local.

“When you build those local relationships, I don’t think that there’s going to be much impact,” she said.
But some celebrations scaled back for different reasons.
The NAACP’s Allegany County branch, which usually hosts an annual festival and parade, opted for a smaller community BBQ after focusing much of its efforts this year on turning a historically Black playground in Cumberland into a community garden.
Tifani Fisher, president of the chapter, said the group will host a new festival this September which will highlight the experience of being Black in Appalachian Maryland. The chapter’s Juneteenth festival will return next year, however.
But Fisher said she has seen the second Trump administration and cutbacks to DEI programs created a sense of wariness among donors and corporate sponsors.
“We haven’t experienced that here locally, and part of that is that we’re just a tight-knit community,” Fisher said. “Those who have supported our Juneteenth festival and the branch’s work are still those who support that.”
LaTisha Gasaway-Paul, president of the Scotland Juneteenth Heritage Festival, said the weeklong celebration in Montgomery County has continuously grown since 2021. The festival has added three new events this year, and has also grown in sponsors, increasing to 17 this year from about a dozen last year, she said.
The festival, which she said drew more than 10,000 people across all its events last year, is located in Scotland, a historically Black community in the Potomac area of Montgomery County. The community started off as 36 acres purchased in 1880 by Gasaway-Paul’s great-great grandfather, William Dove.
After a surge in development in Potomac in the 1960s, she said local residents tried to force the Scotland community off their land, leading to the creation of a campaign to protect the community. She said she feels the weight of preserving her community and its legacy.
Gasaway-Paul said that for her, Juneteenth is more than just a date on a calendar.
“It’s the date that we endure the spirit of the ancestors, the resilience of our people and the promise of a future fate shaped by justice, truth and unity,” Gasaway-Paul said. “It’s the sacred remembrance of freedom.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1499842189-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-19 13:16:19.657703

(Photo: Angela Dennis)As cities across Tennessee prepare for Juneteenth celebrations with banners unfurling, vendors setting up, and leaders finalizing programs honoring Black liberation, a deeper question lingers: What does it mean to celebrate freedom in a state restricting how that freedom’s history is taught?
In Tennessee, state lawmakers have gutted DEI programs, banned books by Black authors, and restricted how teachers can talk about race and history in the classroom.
This year’s celebrations have also come with cutbacks. Across the country, Juneteenth events have been scaled back due to shrinking DEI funding, canceled federal grants and  retreat from corporate support for racial justice initiatives.
For many Black educators, organizers, and students, the policies feel like a modern day echo of the delayed freedom Juneteenth was created to mark. It represents a continued struggle for true freedom and liberation.
 

“The attacks on our history, on information, professors, universities and on teachers, are horrifying,” said Tennessee State Rep. Justin Pearson. “One of the first tools of oppression is to deny the education of people. In this moment in Tennessee and across the country, we are seeing policies and practices that are very harmful to our society’s memory about how we have gotten to where we are.”
On June 19, 1865, enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been free for more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. That delay in freedom highlights, for many, the same struggle seen today as laws and policies seek to suppress the teaching of Black history and limit the freedom of education.
What began as a regional celebration has grown into a national symbol of Black freedom, with Juneteenth becoming a federal holiday in 2021, signed into law by President Joe Biden. Gov. Bill Lee signed a law recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday in 2023.
“Recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday, while passing laws that harm Black communities, reveals deep hypocrisy,” said Pearson. “We’re still trapped by systems, academically, environmentally, politically, and civically, despite being technically free.”
For other community leaders, the recognition of Juneteenth as a federal holiday is significant but raises important questions about the intent and timing of such a move.
Chris Woodhull, a longtime civic leader in East Tennessee, reflected on how he and others were teaching the significance of Juneteenth decades ago, long before it gained national visibility.
“Back in the ’90s, I was teaching about Juneteenth with young people through our organization called Tribe One,” Woodhull said. “We were talking about emancipation and the legacy of slavery before it was popular.”
  “Recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday, while passing laws that harm Black communities, reveals deep hypocrisy,” said Rep. Justin Pearson, a Memphis Democrat. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
When Juneteenth was made a federal holiday in 2021, Woodhull couldn’t help but notice the timing after the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer — and subsequent uprisings —and growing momentum behind the movement to defund the police.
“Juneteenth became a federal holiday not in a vacuum but in the wake of George Floyd’s death, when people were in the streets demanding justice, systemic change, and real transformation,” he said.
While he appreciates the symbolism of the recognition, Woodhull said it felt, in part, like a concession, a gesture meant to appease, rather than challenge systems of power. Still, Woodhull believes Juneteenth holds real significance, especially when it’s rooted in truth and history.
“There are a lot of well-meaning people who want to celebrate Juneteenth but don’t really understand what it means,” he said. “We can’t afford for it to become just another day off. The challenge is to make sure we’re not just marking the day but honoring the story, and the struggle behind it.”
In recent years, Tennessee lawmakers have passed sweeping legislation targeting the teaching of race, diversity and Black history. In 2021, the state passed a law banning divisive concepts in public education, followed by restrictions in 2022 on mandatory DEI training in higher education. These measures were followed by further legislation in 2025 aimed at dismantling DEI programs across the state.
Book bans and curriculum restrictions have also spread across Tennessee. In January 2022, McMinn County removed the Pulitzer-winning graphic novel Maus from its eighth-grade curriculum.
That same year, Hamilton County established a review board to evaluate books for “offensiveness,” leading to the removal of titles with Black and LGBTQ+ voices. In Knoxville, 113 books, including Push by Black author Sapphire, were pulled from schools. Wilson County removed nearly 400 books, including works by Toni Morrison, while Nashville’s public libraries responded by promoting banned books during Banned Books Week. In Chattanooga, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas was also removed.
Despite political efforts to restrict classroom content, educators across Tennessee are finding ways to teach Juneteenth and center Black freedom.
“Juneteenth has always been a topic I discussed in my classes,” said Dr. Learotha Williams, associate professor of African American and Public History at Tennessee State University and director of the North Nashville Heritage Project. “It’s one of those celebrations that has persisted.”
Williams believes Black history must extend beyond traditional classrooms. His courses split time between lectures and community exploration, including visits to historic sites. At Hadley Park Community Center in Nashville, he also led a community course on Black Nashville, taking community members to former enslaved markets and lynching sites. He draws that inspiration from Carter G. Woodson — the author and historian known as the “Father of Black History” — who urged scholars to consider whether their work uplifts or alienates the communities they study.

“That was one of the most rewarding teaching experiences I’ve ever had,” he said. “It involved students and many elders in the community engaging directly with their city’s history.”
In Knoxville, Melody Hawkins, a nationally recognized and award-winning educator, sees Juneteenth as an opportunity for reflection and liberation in classrooms, despite growing restrictions on educators like herself
“Whenever people hear about all the banned books, there’s this assumption that it means we can’t still do the work,” she said. “But you can still be affirming. We just call it being good teachers.”
She believes the focus should be less about restricted terminology and more about how educators show up for their students.
“Juneteenth teaches us about our history and also helps us build classrooms where Black students feel safe, valued, and free to thrive,” she said.
Her upcoming book, Black Girl in the Middle, explores how race and gender bias shape education for Black girls, particularly in middle school. While educators didn’t create the systems that marginalize students, Hawkins says, “we’re still responsible for how we respond to them.”
In East Tennessee, Black in Appalachia, an educational organization, preserves and amplifies Black history and community stories in the region, especially in rural areas where much of the history is whitewashed. Director William Isom sees the current climate as part of a larger historical pattern of erasure.
“From my perspective, none of this is new. This repression is just a continuation of our history,” he said.
Isom points to Reconstruction as a parallel.












Juneteenth strengthens the whole idea of the American narrative and any effort to erase the difference in perspectives around this significant day.


– Adam Dickson, Langston Centre




“If local archives and historical societies looked closely at how their communities were shaped by Reconstruction, and its dismantling, they’d see the throughline.”
His advice is to focus on community record-keeping.
“Everyday people creating their own records, sharing their family stories, can be more powerful than anything an organization can do.”
Adam Dickson, Cultural Director of the Langston Centre in Johnson City, runs a monthly public series called Community History 365. He believes the burden of preserving and teaching Black history now rests heavily on local communities.
“Juneteenth strengthens the whole idea of the American narrative and any effort to erase the difference in perspectives around this significant day,”  Dickson said.“For so long, the Black perspective around Juneteenth had been ignored. That’s why it’s such a pivotal moment and never really considered as it should have been so it was a pivotal moment.”
For Pearson, embracing Juneteenth is also about Black joy. He said it’s as essential as any political or educational fight.
“There’s a song that says, ‘This joy that I have, the world did not give it to me, and the world can’t take it away,’” he said. “We are still here, despite everything that has been done to diminish our humanity. That’s good news. And we have a responsibility to carry the spirit of those who came before us, both in our struggles and in our celebrations. Because they persevered, we can persevere. Because they sacrificed, we can serve. Because they gave, we can do more.”

According to the National Education Association’s most recent data, the average teacher salary in Connecticut was $86,511 in 2023-24, which placed the state sixth in the nation for teacher compensation.
California ranked first with an average salary of $101,084 and Mississippi ranked last with a $53,704 average. The national average was $72,030.
Starting salaries for new teachers averaged $49,860 in Connecticut, placing it 15th nationwide in that category.
Teachers in Connecticut often note the impact of the high cost of living in the state on their pay. The NEA union’s report included a calculation for a minimum living wage for each state, which is defined on its site as the “income needed for [a] family of one adult and one child to have a modest but adequate standard of living in the most affordable metro area.”
Connecticut’s was calculated at $90,897.

I’ve worn a mask the entirety of my college career, far outlasting my peers and others. Being one of only a few people still masking has been a major part of my routine almost every time I leave my house. 
I just like wearing it, even if I’m the only one in the room doing so.
Given how divisive masking was for a time and how so many people were quick to ditch them the second they could, it surprises me that I never got many comments about why I was still masking. It seems like it just became part of the culture, though the assumption now is that you only mask when sick. 


But I don’t really care what people might think of me if they see me in a mask. It’s a free (somewhat) country and masking is still a viable way to protect against viruses.
I’ve greatly enjoyed how masking has prevented me from getting colds these past few years. Back in middle school and high school, it used to be typical for me to get four or five colds a year when cold and flu season rolled around. No matter how hard I tried, it was inevitable I’d get sick and I hated it. But masking proved very effective indeed. 
My pride in not having any more colds was shattered in early 2023 when I caught one from a friend’s brother as we were playing Uno. I became stricter with myself when it came to masking as I recovered. At least when I masked while sick, I could prevent myself from passing it on to others.

Masking has also given me a sense of privacy. I’m usually a rather shy and dislike being looked at. Ever since I was young, I preferred to not be visible to others. Face masks provided me an opportunity to have a sense of the anonymity I craved. Even after most people stopped wearing masks and I surely was sticking out because I was still masking, I still had my privacy. 
Seeing me in-person, you don’t know how I fully look and I can act with greater agency in letting you get closer or not.
It’s been fun to show off my collection of face masks over the course of my college career. I got most of them between 2020 and 2022 and have just cycled through them over the years. During the height of masking, it was fun to see people come up with designs for their masks. If we were going to be required to wear them, we would do so with style. That was the popular attitude I subscribed to at the time. And honoring my collection by showing them all off was how I could express myself at college. Not only was I the perpetual mask wearer, but I was wearer of interesting masks. 
Masking has also benefitted me in terms of avoiding COVID. The only times I’ve gotten COVID was when I didn’t mask properly. The summer of 2022, my family went to Disney World for vacation and were wearing masks. In Animal Kingdom, I was wearing my mask kind of loosely and started to feel stuffy. I tried not to think of the implications and adjusted my mask. The next morning, I woke up feeling certain I was sick and did test positive for COVID. It was a week before classes for my sophomore year started.
In fall 2024, in the first week of classes of my senior year, I had a slight feeling of being sick. When I went home and tested myself, the COVID test came back positive. Déjà vu. My mom said she had it, and that she’d likely caught it while we were at the airport as we returned home from our vacation. Each time a family member or I got COVID strengthened my resolve to continue wearing the mask.
I’m not as worried about COVID as I used to be. I am lucky to be healthy enough to get through with little trouble. But it still is worth it to be careful and considerate of others who have compromised immune systems. It remains important to slow the spread of this disease that is still very present and affecting people to this day, even if it is on a much smaller scale than in previous years.
It’s not particularly enjoyable to still wear a mask. But masking still remains a recommended practice to prevent the spread of COVID. Even after the end of the public health emergency that the COVID-19 pandemic caused, we still live in its shadow every day. I mask regularly when I go out by myself, but I’ve slowly stopped when I’m out with friends or family. 
Maybe I’ll remove to mask for good one of these days but for now I keep at it because I like it.

Picnics. Family outings. Special jazz concerts sponsored by Black sororities and social clubs.
In those days, Juneteenth was an intra-communal gathering, shared between us like secret knowledge, because we knew the story behind the tradition. In June 1865, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation, and months following the Confederate surrender in the Civil War, Union General Gordon Granger finally reached a group of slaves in Galveston, Texas. These enslaved people did not know that the South had lost the Civil War. General Granger informed them they were free. The enlightened former slaves threw a joyous celebration, which became alternately known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day or (today) Juneteenth.
It was originally celebrated every June 19 in Texas. Its popularity spread throughout Black communities in the 1930s when it represented the aspirations of Black Americans who knew they were liberated from slavery, yet lacked full equality. The Fourth of July represented independence, in the sense of breaking from England, while Juneteenth symbolized freedom in both a legalistic and spiritual sense — freedom from slavery before the next step toward full humanity.
In 2023, I was the main speaker at the annual Juneteenth event sponsored by the City of Santa Fe, NM, at which Mayor Alan Webber officially proclaimed Juneteenth Day locally. I reiterated the classic script, describing Juneteenth’s origin, but I also used to the occasion to discuss how New Mexico still had a way to go achieving freedom from hunger, child poverty and the malaise of substance abuse. This is the narrative that Juneteenth bequeaths to the country, since becoming a national event: Celebrate social and economic justice, and believe someday it is coming!
There is no doubt in my mind that this country needs a federal holiday like this one, encouraging the populace to address perceived forms of oppression, with belief that they can survive the travails and, in the end, achieve redemption and renewal. Freedom is both specific, to a particular set of circumstances, and universal, which is why Juneteenth eventually spoke to the hearts and minds of all Americans.
This year, however, the holiday arrives at a time when President Trump is waging an unprecedented war on civil rights, first amendment rights, free speech rights, academic freedom, or the freedom to protest. The administration uses executive orders to force government grantees to desist engaging in speech the administration dislikes, including anything that honors diversity, equity or inclusion; seriously addresses climate change; or highlights the LGBTQ community.
It arrives at a time when Trump’s ICE agents engage in massive raids that terrorize Latino communities, indiscriminately ordering civilians inside unmarked vans and “disappearing” immigrants who have positively contributed to American society. Following protests that erupted against ICE raids in Los Angeles, California Gov. Gavin Newsom accurately critiqued Trump’s immigration policy, asserting that Trump’s methods do more harm than good because, “Instead of focusing on undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records and people with final deportation orders — a strategy both parties have long supported — this administration is pushing mass deportations. Indiscriminately targeting hardworking immigrant families, regardless of their roots or risk. What’s happening right now is very different than anything we’ve seen before.”
With increasing authoritarianism, without consulting California government officials, Trump deployed National Guardsmen and marines to Los Angeles using tear gas and rubber bullets. This move against the populace (which Gov. Newsom called “a reckless deployment of American troops to a major American city”) is among the many ways that the administration discourages citizens from engaging in legal protest or enjoying free speech.
This year, we will celebrate freedom from chattel slavery. We will celebrate a victory for humanity. But the celebration is shadowed by an awareness that bondage can take other forms. It is fear of being arrested, economically disenfranchised or “disappeared.” Fear that the country is inching towards totalitarianism is against the spirit of Juneteenth.

Jeff Hood, a witness to 11 executions, plans to travel to Parchman to pray outside if  Richard Jordan’s is executed June 25.","The Rev. Jeff Hood is “determined to let people know you’re killing my friend.”
Those are the people he’s grown close to before witnessing their executions — a dozen so far and a number that continues to grow as Mississippi prepares to put 79-year-old Richard Jordan to death and the death penalty continues being handed down in over half of all states, particularly the South.
Hood is a spiritual adviser who accompanies death row inmates to their executions, praying for them and sharing last words with them as a culmination of a months-, sometimes years-long relationship. 
By doing that, Hood said he can bring members of the public as close to the execution chamber as they can get and see the impact of the death penalty.  
To date, he has witnessed 11 executions: four in Oklahoma, three in Alabama, two in Texas,  one in Missouri and one in Florida. 
It’s something he may be called to do one day in Mississippi. Hood is not Jordan’s spiritual adviser, but he has communicated with a member of Jordan’s family and he plans to travel to Parchman to pray outside on June 25 if Jordan’s scheduled execution goes through, just as he did in 2022 for the execution of Thomas Loden, a Marine Corps recruiter who kidnapped, sexually assaulted and killed a 16-year-old waitress.

He and advocates have spoken out against Jordan’s scheduled execution, questioning whether it makes sense to see someone who is almost 80 as a safety risk and the fact it’s been 48 years since he was first convicted of capital murder in the kidnapping and death of Edwina Marter in Harrison County. 
He participated in a video released by the Mississippi Office of Capital Post-Conviction Council in which Jordan shares his story and asks the state to commute his sentence to life without the possibility of parole. In the video, Jordan says he was a model citizen until he returned after three tours in the Vietnam War. His defense has argued that he suffered post-traumati striss disorder from the war, a view bolstered on the video by Jordan’s younger siblings — brother Houston Jordan and sister Nordeen Jones — who said he was kind and a role model to them. Former schoolmates, ministers and a retired corrections officer also appear on the video, talking about Jordan’s willingness to help others.
‘Whatever you did to the least of these’
Hood grew up in Georgia in a Southern Baptist family and studied theology. As he studied in Atlanta, he was part of organizing against the 2011 execution of Troy Davis, who maintained his innocence to the end in the murder of a Savannah police officer. 
Connecting with death row inmates and being present at their deaths is something he said he was called by God to do, saying the work aligns with Matthew 25:40: “(W)hatever you did for the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” 
Hood can’t think of a group that embodies “the least of these” more than those sentenced to death. He said he shows them the love of God and encourages them to have the courage to live, even if they have weeks or months left and people want them to be executed. 
“It’s my job to make them hungry to live,” Hood said. “I think that is the greatest resistance possible.”
Innocence isn’t a requirement to work with someone, and he said he will love someone “irrespective of what they’ve done.” But Hood said that doesn’t mean there haven’t been difficult interactions or that he doesn’t think about victims’ families and the severity of death row inmates’ crimes. 
Hood sees how nearly 50 years of waiting for an execution has been torture for any victim’s family, especially the Marters. 
Eric Marter, the elder son of Edwina and Charles Marter, was 11 years old and his younger brother was 4 when their mother died. 
He said it’s been so long and he would have preferred Jordan to have been executed years ago. Over the years of his appeals, Marter said he hasn’t made his ongoing legal case and whether an execution happens a priority. 
“At this point in my life, maybe 30 years ago I may have had more interest in wanting him to be executed,”said Marter, who is 59 and lives in Louisiana. 
“But at this particular point, I don’t really want to waste my time thinking about him.” 
A ‘moral sacrifice’ to be in that chamber’

Spiritual advisers like Hood have been allowed to be in the room and stand alongside the condemned since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with a Texas death row inmate who sued for the right to have his pastor beside him.  
June 10 was the executions of Anthony Wainwright in Florida and Gregory Hunt in Alabama. As both of their spiritual advisors, Hood said the states put him in a position to have to choose whose to attend and break a promise. He was with Wainwright at his execution. 
The week before that, he was on the road and traveled from his home in Arkansas to Alabama and Florida to be with the men and organize against the death penalty with local advocates. From a virtual event streamed from his car June 6, Hood raised issues about violations of Hunt’s and Wainwright’s spiritual liberty and constitutional rights. 
Like Mississippi, most death penalty states use lethal injection, but others are starting to use lethal gas and firing range. Since 2022, Mississippi allows those methods along with the electric chair, but lethal injection is the state’s preference.
Jordan continues to challenge the constitutionality of the drugs Mississippi uses for lethal injection through a federal lawsuit. 
Last year, Hood witnessed the “horror show” execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith in Alabama by nitrogen gas. The pastor remembers seeing Smith start to heave back and forth violently as soon as the gas hit his face, his veins looking like ants under his skin. Smith thrashed against the restraints, and Hood remembers crying – something not typical for him. 
Even if an execution has not been scheduled, Hood stays in contact with two dozen people on death rows around the country. Some call him several times a week and on specific days. 
His contact includes seven in Mississippi, including Willie Manning – for whom the state is seeking an execution date – and others who are still pursuing legal challenges such as Willie Godbolt and Lisa Jo Chamberlin. 
Chamberlin, convicted of two counts of capital murder in 2006, is the only woman on death row in the state, and Hood said he reached out to her knowing a bit about her story and that she needed help. What he found was someone who “desperately needed a friend” and whose mental health suffers because she is isolated.

Unlike death row in Parchman where most of the men are together, Chamberlin is kept on her own in a maximum security unit in the women’s prison at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility. Hood said that often means Chamberlin spends hours in her cell or time in the dayroom on her own. 
Ahead of Jordan’s execution, Hood has called out elected officials like Gov. Tate Reeves, Attorney General Lynn Fitch and justices of the Mississippi Supreme Court for allowing executions to happen but not having to attend or witness them. 
“There’s a moral sacrifice it takes to be in that chamber,” Hood said. 
When he stands beside the condemned, Hood prays and tells them how sorry he is that he wasn’t able to stop the execution. And each time he leaves, he said it’s as if he leaves a piece of his soul behind. 
The next execution might be scheduled in a matter of days, weeks or months, so he doesn’t have much time to recover. Continuing to intervene in executions and speak out against the death penalty also makes him the target of threats and potentially puts his family at risk. Hood is married and the father of five children.
But Hood takes on the risks to his wellbeing and health and sees it as a privilege to work with people on death row and do something he cares about.

WILMINGTON— Delaware Shakespeare is reimagining a comedy favorite with Twelfth Night, O Lo Que Quieras, a bilingual musical adaptation set to run July 17 through August 3 at Rockwood Park as part of the 2025 Summer Festival. 
The production blends English, Spanish, and “Fake-speare,” combining Shakespeare’s classic language with vibrant original music and Latin American influences.
The story follows Venezuelan twins Violeta and Sebastian, who are separated after a shipwreck on the island of Illyria. As Illyria undergoes a political shift, the twins and local residents grapple with protest, power, and identity in a narrative that Ghant says “felt so necessary and important right now.”
Mariah Ghant, Delaware Shakespeare’s Producing Artistic Director, said the musical has been years in the making. Originally developed for the organization’s Community Tour in 2022, the show was born out of a creative challenge extended by former artistic director David Stradley to co-creator Liz Filios. That idea evolved into a full musical with contributions from Tanaquil Márquez, Robi Hager, and Ximena Violante.
“Liz quickly started to feel like the story really spoke to a Latinx, Spanish-speaking group of folks,” Ghant said. “She brought in Tana Márquez, a Latinx playwright and director, and together they built this beautiful, bilingual adaptation.”
Performing a musical outdoors for the first time at Rockwood Park presents new challenges, Ghant noted, especially in terms of sound projection and musical clarity.
“It’s a lot more breath work, a lot more preparation to make sure that the music is being heard clearly,” she said. “Singing and performing outdoors is incredibly different than just doing Shakespeare outdoors.”

The festival typically draws 1,500 to 3,000 attendees across its three-week run, and Rockwood Park’s expansive, sloped grounds offer plenty of space for lawn chairs and large audiences.
This year’s schedule includes special events like Pay What You Will Wednesdays, Family Night Sundays (offering free admission for children under 12 with a paid adult), LGBTQIA+ and BILAM+ Night on July 23, and a Relaxed Performance—a welcoming, “shush-free” show—on July 27.
Ghant hopes the production will connect with audiences of all backgrounds, even those unfamiliar with Shakespeare or Spanish.
“A lot of people think Shakespeare isn’t for them. But as long as you’re willing to be open and see the story, you’ll probably find pieces of yourself in it,” she said. “You don’t have to understand every word. It’s about sitting with the story—and the actors, the music, they really let you in.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-DelShakes-TwelfthNight-IGFeed-1080x1440-rev01-1-2-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-06-19 12:18:59.420722

(Provided, SC State Ports Authority, Walter Lagarenne)MOUNT PLEASANT — It’s a simple economic reality: The number of cargo containers moving through the Port of Charleston closely mirrors growth — or declines — in consumer spending.
Not so simple is U.S. trade policy and President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff pronouncements.
That has the S.C. State Ports Authority looking at a wide-ranging forecast for cargo volumes in the coming fiscal year, which starts July 1.
“If we have a good sense of where durable goods spending will be in the coming months, we can estimate what pier container volumes look like,” said Joey Von Nessen, a research economist with the Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina.
  Joey Von Nessen is a research economist at the University of South Carolina (Provided, University of South Carolina)
Von Nessen, who presented his forecast Tuesday for the authority’s board of directors, said positive trends in spending will go head-to-head with erratic tariff policies over the coming 12 months.
Depending on which factor prevails, Von Nessen sees the number of pier containers moving through Charleston’s terminals ranging from a little more than 1.3 million on the low side and a maximum of 1.5 million in fiscal 2026.
For budgeting purposes, the authority’s board voted to split Von Nessen’s forecast in the middle, with the expectation of about 1.4 million pier containers — that is cargo boxes of all sizes — for the coming fiscal year.
That’s unchanged from the 1.4 million containers the port will see by the time the current fiscal year comes to a close at month’s end.
“With so much uncertainty in our industry and the broader market, we are anticipating mostly flat growth for FY26,” the authority said in a statement.
The past few months have seen stable or growing cargo volumes, and the authority expects a stronger summer as some shippers rush to get goods to market while tariffs are paused.
“The outlook is uncertain after that,” the authority said. “We plan to reevaluate our outlook in January and may reforecast then, depending on the broader market.”
Barbara Melvin, the ports authority’s president and CEO, said regardless of short-term economic situations “the port is a long-cycle business.”
“We are investing today to have the capacity to support our customers for decades to come,” she said.
Von Nessen said a surge in consumer spending during the pandemic years created an artificial bubble — boosted by stimulus dollars — that has largely deflated.
That means people are now in the mood to start buying again. They just might not have the means.
“It turns out we haven’t seen that much growth this year because of the impact of tariffs and changes in trade policy,” he said. “That’s had an impact on prices.”
The cumulative growth in U.S. prices has topped 25% since May 2025 while wages have increased at just a 20% clip during that time.
Tariffs will raise prices even more, “which can make it harder for consumers to continue to spend at current levels,” Von Nessen said.
“The primary headwind is the potential rebounding of inflation due to tariff activity,” he added. “That’s the No. 1 metric to watch.”
The National Retail Federation is forecasting higher inflation that will impact spending.
“Consumers are seeing their way through the uncertainty with trade policies, but expect the inflation associated with tariffs to be felt later this year,” Jack Kleinhenz, the federation’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Consumers remain very price sensitive, and those costs are likely to weigh heavily on consumer budgets.”
Charleston’s port, while impacted by national trends, will be somewhat buffered by population and economic growth in the Southeast, which is outpacing every other U.S. region.
It’s a key reason credit ratings firm S&P Global affirmed the authority’s A-plus rating while downgrading the U.S. port industry as a whole.
“Despite the back and forth and uncertainty that we’ve seen emerge in 2025, as we look ahead this does nothing to change our long-run bullishness on South Carolina and the Southeast,” Von Nessen said. “We have strong economic competitiveness in this region primarily because of the population growth that we’re seeing.”
The ports authority’s board also approved a $294 million capital plan for fiscal 2026 that will support completion of the Navy Base Intermodal Facility where cargo containers will be transferred between trucks and trains.
The budget also includes money for the second phase of the adjacent Leatherman Terminal in North Charleston and upgrades to Columbus Street Terminal in Charleston to alleviate flooding concerns.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cargo-ships-at-wando-1024x366.jpg,,,2025-06-19 12:18:59.420722

(Photo by David Wren/SC Daily Gazette)MOUNT PLEASANT — The $550 million in taxpayer funding that South Carolina lawmakers set aside for two projects at the Port of Charleston will now be used for just one — a rail-based cargo hub adjacent to the Leatherman Terminal in North Charleston.
The Navy Base Intermodal Facility, where cargo containers will be transferred between trucks and trains, is over budget and behind schedule.
The State Ports Authority said this week the project’s budget now totals $545 million — up from an original $349 million price tag three years ago.
Legislators want to know more about SC Ports projects delays, cost overruns

The cost overrun means a second project that was supposed to be funded by the taxpayer dollars — a $150 million barge facility to move containers between port terminals by river instead of trucks — is on indefinite hold.
The remaining $51 million from the 2022 general fund appropriation went to pay off a loan used for early planning documents related to the cargo hub.
The Joint Bond Review Committee’s fiscal accountability subcommittee will meet with ports authority leaders in July to hear an update on the projects. That meeting of the legislative oversight panel has not yet been scheduled.
It’s not clear what legislators will say about the barge project’s suspension.
Those interviewed by the SC Daily Gazette said they are still trying to get up to speed on the ventures ahead of next month’s meeting.
However, the $550 million was given to the authority without a mandate that both projects are completed.
The ports authority said any further increases that could push the cargo hub’s price tag beyond $550 million will be paid for from the maritime agency’s own funds.
Part of the construction delay has been due to disagreements between CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern railroads over how their trains will access the container transfer site, which has been in the works for more than a decade.
Barbara Melvin, the authority’s president and CEO, has also blamed tariffs, trade uncertainties, a changing business climate and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that forces the ports authority to use union labor at new terminals — citing training issues — for the delay.
At this point, the 118-acre Navy Base Intermodal Facility is roughly 80% complete, with miles of new tracks and three of six electric, rail-mounted gantry cranes installed.
Concrete paving has finished, and new buildings and canopies have been completed.
Also, the Cosgrove Avenue Extension — an overpass and pedestrian bridge connecting North Charleston to the city’s Waterfront Park — will open in July. The project also includes other work to minimize the impact of rail traffic on local roads.
The ports authority has long lobbied for a rail-based cargo hub near its waterfront terminals, saying the lack of on-dock or near-dock rail puts the Port of Charleston at a disadvantage to other ports.
Charleston is the only major East Coast port without such rail access.
About 300,000 containers, or roughly one-fourth of the port’s annual total, are moved by rail each year, with trucks handling the rest.
The Navy Base Intermodal Facility will have the capacity to nearly triple that number while potentially eliminating thousands of tractor-trailer trips along local roads and state highways.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/nbif-3-1024x521.jpg,,,2025-06-19 12:18:59.420722

As summer temperatures rise and more Delawareans head outdoors, state health and environmental officials are warning of increased risks from ticks and tick-borne illnesses.
The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) and the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) are urging residents to take precautions to avoid tick bites, which can transmit serious diseases including Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and the increasingly reported Alpha-gal Syndrome (AGS).
According to DPH’s 2024 Vector-Borne Disease Surveillance Report, there were 344 reported cases of Lyme disease in Delaware last year.
The disease, which is transmitted by blacklegged ticks (also known as deer ticks), can cause symptoms ranging from fatigue and fever to joint pain and neurological complications if left untreated.
A telltale bullseye-shaped rash may appear at the site of the bite in some cases.

State health officials also noted a rise in AGS cases, a tick-related condition that can cause an allergic reaction to red meat.
The illness, linked primarily to the lone star tick, became a reportable condition in Delaware in December 2024 after more than 100 cases were documented in the latter half of the year.
“Defending yourself from ticks is not just about comfort, it’s about health,” said DPH Director Steven Blessing. “By following these simple, effective steps, you can protect yourself and your loved ones from tick bites and tick-borne illnesses, ensuring a safe and enjoyable summer.”
DNREC Tick Biologist Dr. Ashley Kennedy emphasized the growing diversity of tick species in the state.
Delaware is now home to at least 15 different tick species, possibly as many as 19, she pointed out.
The most common tick in Delaware is the lone star tick, which does not carry Lyme disease but can transmit ehrlichiosis and is strongly associated with AGS.
The American dog tick, another prevalent species, can spread spotted fever rickettsiosis.
Defending against ticks
Officials recommend preventive measures:

Dress smart: Wear long sleeves and pants, and tuck pants into socks when walking in wooded or grassy areas. Light-colored clothing helps spot ticks more easily.
Avoid tick habitats: Stick to the center of trails and steer clear of tall grass, leaf litter, and dense brush.
Use repellents: Apply EPA-approved insect repellents containing at least 20% DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus.
Conduct tick checks: After spending time outdoors, check yourself, children, and pets thoroughly. Pay close attention to warm, hidden areas like armpits and behind the knees.
Practice yard care: Keep grass trimmed, clear leaf litter, and use gravel or wood chips to separate play areas from wooded zones.

If a tick is found, experts advise removing it promptly with fine-tipped tweezers and cleaning the bite area. Anyone who develops a rash, fever, or flu-like symptoms within 30 days of a tick bite should consult a healthcare provider.
Delawareans are also encouraged to report tick encounters to DNREC and consider saving the tick for identification, which can aid in diagnosis if symptoms develop.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-19-at-11.19.56-AM.png,,,2025-06-19 12:18:59.420722

After the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and Mongolian, the Negro is a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and gifted with second-sight in this American world,—a world which yields him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through the revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his twoness,—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.
The history of the American Negro is the history of this strife,—this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self. In this merging he wishes neither of the older selves to be lost. He would not Africanize America, for America has too much to teach the world and Africa. He would not bleach his Negro soul in a flood of white Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world. He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without having the doors of Opportunity closed roughly in his face.

(Kevin Hardy/Stateline)TOPEKA — Kansas farm income in 2025 is expected to be among the strongest in the last 20 years, bolstered by $2 billion in government payments for depressed crop prices and weather conditions, an agricultural economics expert said Tuesday.
“If you look at the inflation-adjusted farm income for 2025, it’s by far the largest we’ve seen in several years,” said Jennifer Ifft, professor and extension specialist in agricultural policy at Kansas State University. “What drove that sharp increase that we see from 2024 to 2025? The answer is government payments.”
Ifft spoke at a webinar about the outlook for farm income in Kansas and nationally, based on a report from the Rural and Farm Finance Policy Analysis Center at the University of Missouri and Kansas State University’s Department of Agricultural Economics.
Crop and livestock farmers face opposite market conditions, as livestock farmers are thriving amid strong demand while crop farmers face lower prices and high input costs, Ifft said.
“We’ve seen an increase of over $5 billion in livestock receipts since 2020,” she said. “On the crop side, you have seen a decline in crop receipts since 2020. These numbers are very much moving in opposite directions, even though crops have leveled off a little bit.”
Crop receipts fell about $1.6 billion from 2020 to 2025, according to a chart Ifft shared. Data in 2025 is projected.
“Somebody recently reminded me that there’s never been a year when all farms are doing well, and I think that’s especially true this year, and it’s especially important to look under the hood to understand what’s happening with these numbers,” Ifft said.
Although crop farm expenses have decreased, they are still high compared to previous years, she said.
“In 2015, fertilizer expenses have come down, but they’re still 28% higher than the long-run average,” Ifft said. “Pesticides … have come down in 2025, and they’re still 30% higher than that long-run average.”
The long-run average was determined from fertilizer and pesticide expenses from 2006 to 2024.
Ifft highlighted government payments made in recent years, including during the first Trump administration after trade tariffs affected sales; in 2020-2021 related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and those approved at the end of 2024 that will be paid this year related to economic losses for some crop farms and disaster payments.
Gregg Ibendahl, K-State associate professor of agricultural economics, shared data that narrowed Kansas numbers down to a farm level, using information collected from farmers who are part of the Kansas Farm Management Association.
He noted that in 2024, without government payments, about half of Kansas farms in his data would have lost money.
Ibendahl said the current global situation affects farm income projections.
“Some other issues to maybe think about or worry about, is what’s going to happen with the oil supply,” he said, adding that there are wars involving two of the biggest areas in the world where oil is produced, Russia and Ukraine, and now the Middle East conflict between Israel and Iran.
“Surprisingly, though, with the fact that we have two major conflicts going on in two of the major oil-producing areas of the world, oil is still in the $70 range,” Ibendahl said. “I don’t know if the traders are being a little optimistic. They kind of got burned a little bit when the Ukraine war first started, because they had jacked up oil prices into about the $130 range. Turns out that it really didn’t affect Russia’s ability to produce oil.”
If oil prices would escalate quickly, it would affect diesel and fertilizer prices, he said.
 National outlook

Kansas parallels what is happening across the country.
“The bottom line at the national level is that we are seeing short- and medium-term pain for field crops because of lower prices, sticky costs,” said Alejandro Plastina, director of the Rural and Farm Finance Policy Analysis Center. “In the cattle sector, I would say the picture is better. There are limited supplies, mostly on beef and cattle production, high prices and lower feed costs than in the past, still high, but lower than the past.”
Plastina said government payments, specifically ad hoc payments made based on need to address situations such as weather events, were important in 2023 and 2024.
“At the aggregate level, we are projecting higher net farm income in 2025,” he said. “But there’s a lot of uncertainty regarding the impact of tariffs and trades, whether we will have a farm bill this year, reconciliation and what it will look like, and then what’s next? That’s a big question for us.”
Like Ifft, Plastina said government support from 2023 and 2024 being paid out this year will increase net farm income.
“In the absence of another round of big ad hoc, direct government payments in 2026, which there’s no sign or signal at this point that they might occur —  without those payments, net farm income would decline by 20% in 2026 to be barely above what we have as an estimate for 2024,” he said.
Of the $41 billion in net farm increase predicted in 2025, $33 billion of it is in government payments, Plastina said.
“Net farm income is up for one time in 2025 for those who will receive the payments, but managing that cash flow generated in 2025 to cushion the drop in margins going forward, I think will be critical for the ag sector,” he said.

States will not be allowed to enforce any law for a 10-year period, “limiting, restricting, or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate commerce.” The bill text also says states could not enforce artificial intelligence laws during the moratorium.
Montana is a leader in artificial intelligence legislation according to one legislator who driving much of the state’s legislation. Both Republicans and Democrats expressed concern this week the provisions in the Big Beautiful Bill Act could undo progress when it comes to protecting privacy and as a potential state rights issue.
Artificial intelligence is not an issue following traditional party lines, and some U.S. Senators are trying to send that message. On Wednesday, Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, and Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti held a joint Zoom press conference on the issue.
Blackburn spoke, Cantwell answered a variety of questions, and the attorneys general talked about some of the laws they’ve had on the books and the impact a ban could have. 
“Hopefully, as a result of those laws there, there are guardrails baked in that prevent the worst abuses that we fear,” Skrmetti said in response to a Daily Montanan question. “But this is a technology still in its infancy, and the earlier the law can shape the contours of what products provide, the safer people will be. And if we lose the ability for the states to regulate that, you know, Congress, even moving as fast as it can, will not be able to keep up with all of the risks.”
Montana artificial intelligence legislation was held up as an example of some of the laws that could become unenforceable during the press conference. None of Montana’s federal delegation returned a request for comment on this story.
The Treasure State has a slate of artificial intelligence laws on the books, many crafted or pushed by state Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, a Billings Republican, who has been a leader on the issue. Zolnikov, along with Rep. Jill Cohenour, a Helena Democrat, and Rep. Braxton Mitchell, a Flathead Republican, all saw artificial intelligence bills signed by Gov. Greg Gianforte. 
The Republican governor famously sold RightNow Technologies to Oracle for $1.5 billion in 2011, an acquisition that likely helped kickstart Bozeman’s push toward becoming a technology hub.
“Regulation tends to follow, not lead,” Gianforte said during a press conference on April 24 when asked about tech legislation during the session. “So I think we have to be careful as we look at regulations, that we don’t impede the adoption of new innovations. If there’s a problem, let’s fix it.”
Under the 10-year moratorium, Montana might not be able to fix things.
During the April press conference, the governor also pointed to a bill studying social media impacts on mental health, using it as an example of a technological consequence “we could never have anticipated.” He advocated caution but said he wants the government to stay out of the way of advancements. 
Gianforte signed numerous laws passed in 2025 relating to artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, blockchain and data centers. This included limiting the state government usage of AI and the technology’s use in elections, as well as people’s rights to privacy and to compute.
In Montana, the issue and the reasons people have for their opinion on AI is varied. 
Data centers, which help run the digital modern world, need huge amounts of power and became a topic of discussion at the legislature. Montana’s utility monopoly is in the middle of a public rate case, and some are worried adding more tech infrastructure could make power even more expensive.
For others, it’s trying to protect the average Montanan. That’s where Rep. Coenhour’s approach on the issue comes from including a bill to protect people’s personal data, called name, image, and likeness. On that bill, HB 514, she also worked with the governor’s office, specifically Lt. Gov. Kristen Juras, on amendments to help get it to pass. Juras did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Cohenour, along with Sen. Laura Smith, another Helena Democrat, pushed for bills against fabricated explicit images, such as fake sexual images of teens being used more frequently as a bullying tactic.
“I’m scared. And I think Montanans should be scared about their data and the way they’re affected by AI working in these different systems,” Cohenour said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “It’s scary.”
Zolnikov’s said that Montana was putting artificial intelligence laws on the books because Congress has done little to regulate the issue. He’s expressed multiple times he feels Montana is far ahead of other states and the federal government on artificial intelligence and other new technologies.
He also expressed a little frustration that some states have fully banned certain artificial intelligence technologies, calling it “an overreaction.” Zolnikov, who believes in open sourcing of code and software over big tech companies controlling the entire industry, wants innovation, but wants sideboards as well.
“It’s kind of a Catch-22. They don’t want states to do it,” Zolnikov said. “They refuse to do it. Now they’re looking at a ban. What do you do?”
He’s well aware of the dangers it can bring, but said that America cannot get behind its “adversaries” in innovation by stifling artificial intelligence.
“There’s a whole other side to this coin,” Zolnikov said, “It’s way above my pay grade, I’ll put it that way.”
Mitchell, who often expresses his support for President Donald Trump, said that while he supports “99%” of the Big Beautiful Bill Act, the 10-year moratorium is not something he can support. He said it undermines the intent of HB 178, which limits government usage of AI.
“We shouldn’t be blocking states from protecting citizens against surveillance abuse, censorship, and tech-driven manipulation,” Mitchell wrote in an email on Wednesday. “I’ll keep standing for individual liberty and limited government, with or without a moratorium. Hopefully it’s stripped out in the Senate or when it goes back over to the House.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/capitolpeople-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-19 12:18:59.420722

(Carnegie Mellon University)COLUMBIA, S.C. – Edda Fields-Black was working on a book about rice plantations when she came across the story of a raid in Beaufort that freed more than 700 slaves from Lowcountry plantations.
The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.

She tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad.
So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
Harriet Tubman
Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.
 

“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
Finding the story
As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands who drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

On his right is State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The owners of 82 smoke and vape shops and other THC-friendly retailers in Lincoln are receiving cease and desist letters this week from Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers about selling THC-containing products. 
Hilgers, the state’s top prosecutor, ramped back up his push to get stores to stop selling delta-8, delta-9 and other products containing tetrahydrocannabinol that he argues offer people an unregulated, unsafe, illegal way to get high.
Store owners in several cities that Hilgers has targeted have argued state law is unclear about the legality of selling the products. Some have argued that federal law might have a loophole allowing it.
Hilgers had said he would pause his efforts to warn and then sue retailers still offering the targeted THC products if the Legislature in the 2025 session passed a bill to clearly make them illegal in the state, which stalled. The bill is likely to return in 2026.
His office, which also files civil cases to enforce state law, has sent the letters to 204 stores statewide alleging unfair business practices, deception and violations of safety requirements for food. That tally includes 104 stores in Omaha, four in Kearney and three in Nebraska City.
This year, the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office worked with AG’s Office investigators to purchase products from stores in the Lincoln area. The AG’s Office said the products were incorrectly labeled as hemp.
The letters threaten multiple aspects of the businesses, including their tobacco licenses and their bottom lines. They offer not to sue if the stores voluntarily pull the products off shelves.
“Our office’s testing showed that nearly every one of these products were mislabeled,” Hilgers said. “It operates without regard to the health or safety of Nebraskans.”

(Stock photo from Getty Images)Cincinnati-based Bon Secours Mercy Health describes itself as a “ministry” that seeks to serve “the poor, dying and underserved.”
However, it’s one of two Ohio “nonprofit” hospital systems to face scrutiny from Congress over the huge amounts it’s raking in from a federal program meant to subsidize care for the poor.
It’s using some of that money to pay lavish salaries and buy stadium-naming rights.
Meanwhile, it is reportedly boosting the bottom line by serving wealthy communities and neglecting poorer ones — an outcome that, if true, would directly counter the program’s intent.
In April, the U.S. Senate Health, Labor and Pensions Committee released the results of a years-long investigation it made into a federal program that has exploded over the past 15 years. Among the committee’s concerns was that there appeared to be few — if any — controls on the way hospitals, clinics, and contract pharmacies spend the billions they receive from the program.
And it singled out two Ohio-based hospital chains for special focus — Cleveland Clinic and Bon Secours Mercy Health.
“These hospitals were selected for this investigation as a result of media reports alleging abuse of the 340B Program, such as hospitals cutting services to underserved populations and expanding into affluent areas to increase reimbursement rates and subsequent revenue under the 340B Program,” the committee report said.
The committee’s findings about Cleveland Clinic, which received nearly $1 billion from the program over a 38-month period, are detailed here.
The report focused on Bon Secours Mercy Health because of media reports that it had gained 340B status from a hospital it owns in a poor, Black neighborhood in Richmond, Va. It steadily depleted resources at that hospital, while adding them at facilities in more affluent neighborhoods nearby, the reporting said.
Bon Secours Mercy Health didn’t respond to requests for comment. But observers said such conduct is likely happening elsewhere in the 50-hospital chain.
 Explosive growth

Intended to subsidize care for the needy, the 340B program has grown from $5 billion a year in 2010 to nearly $67 billion in 2023, and analysts say that growth is only accelerating.
An obscure drug discount program stifles use of federal lifeline by rural hospitals

The program works by requiring drugmakers to give deep discounts off of list prices for drugs to qualifying hospitals, clinics, and the pharmacies with which they contract.
Those entities are then allowed to charge insurers and uninsured customers the full list price and pocket the difference.
The idea behind 340B was to help providers with a large share of uninsured and Medicaid patients make ends meet while they shoulder the cost of uncompensated and under-compensated care.
Cleveland Clinic claimed last month that the program has no impact on taxpayers. But Antonio Ciaccia, a Columbus-based drug-pricing analyst, said the program creates billions in higher costs for insurers and ultimately consumers.
After Congress created the Medicaid Prescription Drug Rebate Program in 1990, it created 340B in 1992, requiring drugmakers to give discounts to qualifying hospitals and clinics that were equal to the Medicaid rebates.
The program grew relatively slowly until passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, when rules changes allowed a lot more entities to qualify. It’s since grown by leaps and bounds and is now the second-largest federal prescription-drug program, behind only Medicare Part D.
Growing numbers of hospital systems have joined the 340B program through seemingly giant loopholes.
Cleveland Clinic, for example, doesn’t admit enough Medicaid and uninsured patients to qualify under the original 340B rules. But under a quirk in the new rules, it was allowed in as a “rural-referral center” even though it’s headquartered in the middle of a big city.
Rural referral centers have lower barriers to qualify and are the fastest-growing type of 340B hospitals. Possibly indicating abuse, by 2022, 82% of so-called “rural referral centers” were located in urban areas, as were 77% of their patients, according to the Berkeley Research Group, a consulting firm.
 Intended outcome?

Facilities owned by another Ohio-based group — Bon Secours Mercy Health — qualified another way.
Its Richmond Community Hospital in Virginia is located in a low-income Black neighborhood in the city’s East End, where it qualifies as a federal “disproportionate share” hospital and thus for the 340B program.
However, the New York Times reported in 2022 Bon Secours Mercy Health hollowed out Richmond Community, closing its intensive care unit, its maternity ward, and other vital departments.
At the same time, it created legal connections between the hospital and other clinics it owned in wealthier parts of town so that they could get 340B drug discounts. In those facilities it could reap a greater percentage of the 340B benefit because more patients are privately insured. That’s because transactions involving Medicaid patients aren’t eligible for the discount.
The paper reported on the perverse outcome of Bon Secours Mercy Health’s practices: It stripped its hospital in a poor neighborhood of resources while it used money meant for it to build and renovate lavish facilities where few poor people went.
“Bon Secours was basically laundering money through this poor hospital to its wealthy outposts,” Dr. Lucas English, who worked at Richmond Community until 2018, told the Times. “It was all about profits.”
For participating hospitals, the profits can be huge.
Bon Secours Mercy Health collected $276 million in 340B benefits over a five-year period that ended in 2023, the Senate committee reported. That was just for the facilities that participate in 340B under Richmond Community’s designation — not those connected to any of the chain’s dozens of other hospitals that might separately be part of the 340B program.
 Questionable spending

Some critics who want to see reform say there must be greater controls over how money collected under the program is spent. As it is, there don’t appear to be any.
Bon Secours Mercy Health and Cleveland Clinic told Senate investigators that they simply put the money into their general revenue and don’t specifically account for it after that.
As tens of billions more flow each year into hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies that participate in 340B, some are accused of spending on things that have nothing to do with health care — much less health care for the poor.
For example, how much New York University’s Langone Hospitals receive from the 340B program is not publicly available, but the number surely isn’t small. The system raised eyebrows when it spent an estimated $8 million advertising itself during the Super Bowl.
Bon Secours paid $4.5 million in 2013 for the 10-year naming rights of a sports and concert arena in downtown Greenville, South Carolina, claiming it would produce better health outcomes for the community. A five-year extension to keep the name Bon Secours Wellness Arena was signed in 2023.
“We’ve truly used this collaboration to expand our reach beyond hospital walls and live out our mission of building healthier communities, which is why we are very excited to extend this partnership and continue working together to make a difference in our community for many years to come,” Mark Caldwell, an executive with the 340B hospital, said in a written statement.
How the community would be made healthier by the arena’s food and beverage offerings isn’t obvious.
“The arena proudly offers Carolina Smoke BBQ, Well Pressed and Swamp Dog food stands, Reedy River Roost (our in house fried chicken shop!), GVL Pizza, Moe’s Southwest Grill, Pepsi products, and a nice selection of craft beer, domestic beer, and wine,” says the arena’s website, which has a picture of a bartender pouring gin into a cup.
Mercy Health also held the naming rights to the Lake Erie Crushers baseball stadium in Avon, Ohio, until last year. Mercy Health Lorain Hospital, 12 miles away, is a 340B facility.
 Community benefit

Nonprofit hospitals receiving huge amounts from 340B aren’t just facing questions about whether they’re using those funds in the best interest of the poor and uninsured.
Nonprofit hospitals generally have been coming under fire as analyses have shown that most are not providing community services that are commensurate with the huge tax breaks they enjoy.
Theoretically, institutions are given tax exemptions in exchange for providing community benefits, but in Ohio most nonprofit hospitals receive more than they give, according to a recent analysis.
An obscure drug discount program stifles use of federal lifeline by rural hospitals

The nonpartisan Lown Institute this year reported that Ohio’s nonprofit hospitals get $2.2 billion annually in tax breaks. Yet nearly three quarters (74%) of them provide less than that in community service, the report said.
That creates a $1.3 billion annual “fair share” deficit — the second-highest of the 20 states studied, the report said. Cleveland Clinic was the biggest offender in the state, with a $207 million annual deficit. That also qualified as the fifth-highest among any hospital in the 20 states, the report said.
Some of these “nonprofit” hospitals are also paying their top brass huge salaries. In the case of Bon Secours Mercy Health, CEO John Starcher Jr. made $8.8 million in reportable compensation in 2023 and an estimated $3.5 million more in “other compensation from the organization and related organizations,” the nonprofit’s IRS Form 990 says. The resulting $12.3 million is 176 times the median household income in Ohio.
The Economic Research Institute in 2022 put Starcher among the 10 highest-paid nonprofit CEOs in the country. The average nonprofit CEO made much less — just $152,199, the report said.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)On June 3 in Pierre, a gaggle of Mitchell city leaders delivered an unambiguous message to the state’s prison construction work group.
The city council, mayor, county commission, sheriff and various economic development officials were all in agreement: a patch of land south of Mitchell could easily host a new prison for 1,500 or more inmates, and their community would reap the benefits.
That wall of official support has since cracked under the weight of fierce public opposition.
A sea of people in red T-shirts – red for “stop,” like a stoplight – have greeted city council members and county commissioners during the public comment portions of recent meetings in Mitchell.

The Davison County sheriff withdrew his support within days. Mitchell’s mayor pulled back shortly thereafter. Both men said their backing was provisional and subject to change by the will of the community.
About 50 of the people on hand for an informational session Tuesday night at Mitchell Technical College wore red T-shirts.
To hear Dwight and Barbara Stadler of Mitchell tell it, support for a prison in their town had never extended beyond leadership offices. Neither of them wore red T-shirts on Tuesday, but both are firmly in the anti-prison camp.
“They didn’t tell us about it until after the fact,” Barbara Stadler said of Mitchell’s initial pitch to the Project Prison Reset task force.
The opposition in Mitchell mirrors what state officials already faced in rural Lincoln County – and are beginning to face in Worthing – as they try to find space for a men’s prison. The facility would ease overcrowding in the correctional system and replace the oldest parts of the Sioux Falls penitentiary, a facility that dates to the late 1800s.  


 Locations of the potential prison locations that remain in play, plus the location of the original rural Lincoln County site that’s been ruled out.
Other sites see pushback
The selection of land for a new men’s prison south of Harrisburg in late 2023 spurred the creation of a nonprofit organization whose activism contributed first to that $825 million project’s legislative defeat in February, then to the removal earlier this month of the land set aside for it from the list of possible sites for any future prison.
Neighbors Opposed to Prison Expansion (NOPE) also sued the state in hopes of forcing it to abide by local zoning rules. A Lincoln County judge rejected that argument; the state Supreme Court is considering an appeal, though its ruling would now matter for future state-local disputes, not the dispute over that specific prison site.
No one in Mitchell has sued – the state hasn’t decided to do more than study the land as an option – but community members have launched a Facebook group called “NO Davison County,” whose page is populated with skeptical dialogue about the prison idea.
The group had 1,200 members as of Wednesday afternoon.
Prison group narrows options
That Mitchell became a focal point at all is an outgrowth of a choice made at the June 3 meeting in Pierre.
The Project Prison Reset group, convened by Gov. Larry Rhoden to find solutions for overcrowding after the initial prison plan’s legislative loss, left four locations on the table at the end of its meeting that day, culled from a list of more than a dozen: Mitchell, a separate Lincoln County site in Worthing, Springfield and Sioux Falls. 
Open process and publicity draw wide range of offers for state prison site

The latter two options would involve building on land the state Department of Corrections already owns, even though no tract of that land would be large enough for a prison the size of the one shot down by lawmakers in February. The request for proposals sent in April sought potential sites with more than 100 acres.
In Springfield, the state would need to build within the footprint of Mike Durfee State Prison, which is less than 70 acres altogether. In Sioux Falls, it could mean building another floor onto the penitentiary complex’s Jameson Annex, on land adjacent to the penitentiary (less than 30 acres), or on land west of town currently used to house juvenile offenders (68 acres).
In addition to its vote to narrow down possible prison sites, the group opted to cap the price of any new prison at $600 million – far less than the $2 billion a consulting group called Arrington Watkins had suggested the state would need to spend on new facilities to address overcrowding over the next decade.
Members of the NOPE group were celebratory on social media over the removal of the initial Lincoln County site from consideration. Since then, the group has shifted the focus of its activism to Worthing, where task force members are considering a site off Interstate 29 that’s not far from the original Lincoln County site.
The NOPE group discussed the Worthing site at a meeting in Canton on Tuesday. Today, the group will lead an informational session at Worthing Elementary School.
Seven days ago, Worthing Mayor Crystal Jacobson came out against a prison near her city.
Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said in 2023 that he’d prefer a new prison be built outside the city. 
He was more measured at the first Project Prison Reset meeting in early April. At that point, TenHaken testified that he wasn’t going to advocate “for a specific location,” but predicted that the task force would face the kind of pushback that’s since appeared from the neighbors to any site large enough to hold a new prison.
“No matter where you decide, you’re going to have a fight on your hands,” TenHaken said.
Less fight – but little space – in Springfield
The second project prison reset meeting was in Springfield, and included testimony from residents who told the task force that the prison was a positive force for the town.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen and Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko both took time at the end of the meeting to assure residents that the state’s commitment to the Mike Durfee facility is solid.
South Dakota corrections work group formally backs need for new prison

The mayor of Springfield, Scott Kostal, was on hand for Tuesday’s meeting in Mitchell and told residents not to fear a prison. The medium security facility in his town, once a university, has been a good neighbor, Kostal said, hasn’t forced the city to pay more for public safety or infrastructure, and hasn’t affected property values.
Kostal said he’s been surprised at how much his town’s property is worth.
“If there’s a problem with property values going down because of the prison, will somebody please call the Bon Homme County Assessor’s Office and let them know?” Kostal said Tuesday.
Springfield can’t address the state’s full slate of needs though, Kostal told South Dakota Searchlight in a Wednesday interview. There isn’t enough space on the Durfee campus to build a 1,500 or 1,700-bed facility, which is what the most recent consultant’s report suggests is needed to address overcrowding.
There is some green space inside the fence and a parking lot that could hold a few hundred more inmates, according to a previous consultant’s report, but Kostal says anything more substantial would put vocational and educational programming at risk.
“The only way you could remotely do that would be to remove those buildings or eliminate those programs,” Kostal said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PXL_20250617_223817084-scaled-e1750343012549-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-19 11:01:16.812836

The Capital Chronicle asked Braun about the idea after he spoke to Future Farmers of America students at a state convention in West Lafayette.
“I get asked that often by people that are good supporters, especially from the time I spent out in the Senate. But when I came back here and gave up another term there, this was about a job that looks like you’re going to get a lot more done with the time that you’re spending at it.”
The 71-year-old is Indiana’s oldest governor and a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, who is term limited. He spent much of his time in the U.S. Senate criticizing the nation’s deficit. The wealthy businessman has spent his first months in office as governor trimming the state budget, trying to reform property taxes and focusing on health care regulations and laws.

(Photo: Bertie County Schools)Even as teachers’ salaries have risen in some states, the changing housing market has left many of them “priced out” of communities where they work, according to a recent paper by the National Council on Teacher Quality (NCTQ) titled “Priced Out: The Growing Challenge of Teacher pay and Housing Costs.”

Author Katherine Bowser, a research analyst NCTQ, contends it’s more important than ever for teachers to be able to afford to live where they work. She cites recent research showing that teachers with long commutes are more likely to leave districts, be absent from work and receive lower observation scores than those who live closer.
“To retain a high-quality teaching staff, it is in districts’ best interest to pay teachers enough to afford housing reasonably close to where they teach,” Bowser wrote. “Yet given skyrocketing housing costs, district leaders are left wondering where the money will come from.”
Finding affordable housing has been particularly difficult for beginning teachers who earn lower salaries than veteran counterparts, Bowser said. The percentage growth of home prices and percentage growth of one-bedroom rental costs have “consistently and dramatically outpaced beginning teacher salary growth and general inflation,” she said.
Between 2019-2025, home prices increased by 47% while rental costs jumped 51%. Beginning teacher pay only increased by 24%, Bowser reported, while inflation increased 26%.
“This means that although salaries have almost kept pace with inflation, there is a widening gap between income and housing affordability,” she said.
Teachers who began their careers in 2019 have less purchasing power today than when they started, Bowser said. From 2019 to 2024 home purchase prices and rental costs increased by an average of 44% and 42% respectively while pay for teachers who started in 2019 saw an average 34% to 35% salary increase, which outpaced the 23% growth in inflation, she said.
“Despite this growth, it still failed to keep pace with the housing market,” Bowser said. “Consequently, teachers who started in 2019 in our sample districts lost purchasing power for buying or renting a home compared to when they began teaching.”
Bowser’s study examined 72 large, urban districts. It found that new teachers can’t afford to rent a one-bedroom apartment in about half of the districts in the sample, even if they held a master’s degree. Rent is considered unaffordable if a person spends more than 30% of their income on housing.
In 2019, there were 18 districts in the sample where new teachers with bachelor’s degrees couldn’t afford the rent and 11 for those with master’s degrees. That number jumped to 39 in 2025 for teachers with bachelor’s degrees and 34 for those master’s degrees. Districts in Mecklenburg and Wake counties are among those Bowser found unaffordable for beginning teachers.
“This year, rent for a one-bedroom unit costs over 40% of beginning, bachelor-degree-holding teacher salaries in 10 districts, with four surpassing 45%,” she said. For beginning, master-degree-holding teachers, San Diego Unified School District (CA) remains the most unaffordable district (45%) and there are four more in which rent constitutes over 40% of salaries.”
The most affordable district for beginning teachers is Wichita, Kansas Public Schools were teachers pay only 18% of salary to rent a one-bedroom apartment.
In 2019, there were nine unaffordable districts for teachers with a bachelor’s degree and five years of experience compared with 29 in 2025, Bowser found. For teachers with 10 years of experience and a bachelor’s degree, there were two districts in the sample deemed unaffordable and 18 in 2025. There were no unaffordable districts for teachers with master’s degrees in 2019.
Bowser also found that homeownership, like it is for many Americans in other professions, is becoming increasingly unrealistic for teachers.
“A back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals that teachers with a master’s degree would need an average of 13 years to save for a 20% down payment in their region, while those with bachelor’s degrees would require an average of 14 years,” Bowser said, using 2025 data as a snapshot in time to estimate the number of years required to save a 20% down payment based on 10% annual savings that accumulate over time.
In 2019, homeowners’ monthly housing payments in 46 districts were unaffordable for beginning teachers with a bachelor’s degree and 41 for those with a master’s. By 2025, 54 districts were unaffordable regardless of degree attainment.
Meanwhile, in 2019, homeowners’ monthly housing payments were unaffordable in 36 sample districts for teachers with a bachelor’s degree and five years of experience and 52 districts in 2025. For teachers with a bachelor’s degree and 10 years of experience, homeowners’ monthly housing payments were unaffordable in 29 districts in 2019 and 47 districts in 2025. Homeowners’ monthly housing payments were unaffordable in 22 districts for teachers with master’s degrees in 2019 and 44 by 2025.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dream-Point-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-19 11:01:16.812836

Some prisoners commenced a hunger strike in protest.,"In summary
Incarcerated people in more than 20 California prisons have limited communication because of expansive restrictions that took effect this month. Some prisoners commenced a hunger strike in protest.


Nearly two dozen state prisons last week imposed sweeping restrictions on their incarcerated population — including shutting off all outside communication. Now, hundreds of prisoners are reported to be on a hunger strike to protest the system’s largest restrictions since the pandemic. 
The corrections department “significantly limited” the daily activities and movement of roughly 34,000 incarcerated people on June 12 in response to a recent uptick in violence, overdoses and contraband, according to its website. 
Under the restrictions, incarcerated people are forced to remain primarily in their cell or dormitory. All in-person visitation, programming, phone access and tablet communications has been suspended. Medical care and other essential services will continue, the department said. 
The department did not say when the restrictions will end.
Legal experts and advocates called the department’s move drastic and said the approach is solitary confinement in all but name. 
“It’s a very lonely space to be in,” said Warren Hands, supervising parole success advocate at UnCommon Law, a nonprofit. “Addiction is real. Mental health issues are real. And they are exacerbated by these lockdowns.”
Corrections Secretary Jeff Macomber said in a written statement that the department has an obligation to ensure public safety for staff, incarcerated individuals and the communities.
“We recognize the concerns of the incarcerated and their families and how this impacts participation in rehabilitation programs and visiting,” he said. 
The department published a press release late Tuesday that listed a number of armed assaults on staff members, armed battery on incarcerated people, and several riots in the weeks leading up to the restrictions, but did not attribute those incidents to specific prisons. 
Families of incarcerated people say the restrictions are cruel and collective punishment. Angel Torrez said it feels unbearable to have no contact with his father, who is incarcerated at Folsom State Prison.
“I wonder if he’s safe and sound,” said Torrez. The department “is playing propaganda warfare. They are professionals of abstract, obtuse, and vague statements that are generated to keep families in the dark.”
At prisons across the country, lockdowns have become increasingly common due to staffing shortages. In California, the corrections department has imposed broad restrictions on incarcerated people twice in the span of three months. 
Prisons report ‘surge in violence’
The last restrictions on March 8 were placed on nearly a dozen prisons due to a “surge in violence against staff and incarcerated people.” They ended on April 11. During that time, at least three incarcerated people were killed and one officer reportedly was attacked.
In recent years, the department has come under fire for its approach to managing violent incidents and contraband. It was criticized by a Sacramento County Superior Court Judge in 2022 for creating violence when it merged incarcerated people from the general population with those who were previously protected, such as informants, bypassing established procedures in the process. 
The following year, an oversight agency found that drugs continued to get inside California prisons during the pandemic when public health protocols prohibited visits. 
“It’s an open secret that staff are the primary vector of contraband into the prison,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor at UCLA. 
She said a lockdown may be a useful tool if it’s done in a limited way, but the department’s blanket policy appears to be hard to defend.
“This is a blunt instrument when they should be using a scalpel,” she said. “The question is the relationship between the ill that they are trying to wrestle with and the strategy that they are adopting to try to address it. I remain unconvinced that a lockdown of this scale is necessary to address this problem.”
Hunger strike in Salinas
One day after the corrections department implemented the restrictions, incarcerated people at Salinas Valley State Prison formally declared a hunger strike. 
“This action arises in response to persistent and unlawful practices by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, including the use of indiscriminate lockdowns, deprivation of rehabilitative and constitutional rights, and collective punishment of the incarcerated population,” they wrote in a letter provided to CalMatters. “This protest is not rooted in defiance but in our firm demand that (the corrections department) adhere to its obligations under the U.S. Constitution, California Penal Code, and Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations.”
Corrections spokesperson Terri Hardy said the department has procedures to monitor and evaluate hunger strikes. 
Brooke Terpstra, a member of the anti-prison group Oakland Abolition & Solidarity, estimated that upwards of 500 people are participating in the strike. He suspects incarcerated people at other prisons with restrictions will join. 
“All hunger strikes are notable, but this is a major occurrence,” he said. “(The department’s) unified collective punishment has produced a unified collective response. It’s inspiring.”

This story first appeared on Tennessee Lookout.
The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

The Tennessee House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”

This story was originally reported by Errin Haines of The 19th.  Meet Errin and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Thursday marks the first national observance under President Donald Trump of Juneteenth, the day commemorating the end of slavery in the United States that became a federal holiday in 2021.
This year, it comes as Trump’s presidency has been marked by attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion and attempts to erase and minimize Black history as part of the American story. What does it mean to claim resistance and resilience in an age of exclusion?
For perspective on how to consider Juneteenth this year, I spoke to Dr. Kaye Wise Whitehead, president of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, the organization that founded Black History Month. Whitehead shared her insights on the politics of history, memory and race and why traditions matter even more in the current political climate.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Errin Haines: How do you understand the meaning of Juneteenth — not just as a holiday, but as a marker of America’s unfinished work?
Kaye Wise Whitehead: The country has significantly changed between January 19, 2025, and today. Every single thing that we have fought for — that, I would argue, we began to take a little bit for granted — has either been canceled, erased or is under fire. Juneteenth is no different.
We don’t wait to be celebrated; we celebrate ourselves. We celebrate our history, and we celebrate our contributions to this country. Our lives and our histories are etched into the stones of the buildings. So we don’t have to have a proclamation from anyone else but ourselves.
What does it mean to celebrate emancipation in a political era marked by rollbacks of civil rights and diversity policies?
This is why it’s even more important that we take a moment to stop and understand the significance of Juneteeth. Juneteenth, as a holiday, has been celebrated within the Black communities of Texas and Louisiana since right after American slavery ended. They did not wait for it to be a holiday.
That is really the message of the American historical narrative. It is the people that lead the government. It’s not government leading the people. It is “We the People.” And Juneteenth is a great example of that.
If we don’t center the teaching and the understanding of Black history, if we don’t amplify it, if we don’t force it onto America’s agenda, then it can be erased. People don’t understand that if you erase the contributions of Black people to America, you are essentially erasing the American historical narrative, because Black history is American history. It is tied to the fabric that makes up the blanket of this country.
Juneteenth is a celebration. It is a time of firing up the grill, it is a time to line dance, of getting out the fans, and celebrating the beauty and the wonder and the joy that is essentially in the heart of Black culture. Our culture is not rooted in just tears and tragedy and trauma and slavery and oppression and lynching. Our culture is rooted in joy and laughter and tenacity and the ability to overcome and find places of happiness despite what the situation is around us.
What parallels do you see between the delayed freedom of Juneteenth and the current efforts to delay or deny racial progress — whether in education, policy or civic life?
We are not powerless in the face of those who seek to erase us. In fact, this is the best time for us to reclaim our power — our history is a part of this story. We can turn all of our spaces into freedom schools: a church basement, if you’re standing in the middle of a coffee shop, if you’re sitting with young children. You put it on your bags, you put it on your T-shirt, you put it on your social media. They can’t stop us from telling our story. Even though they are banning books, they don’t stop me from buying books and giving them to people. We have to take back our power in this moment, because otherwise, that is how authoritarianism wins. It makes you believe you’re powerless.
You’ve spoken and written powerfully about memory as resistance. How does celebrating Juneteenth become a form of resistance in a time of historical erasure?
I argue that you only have four choices right now. You fight, which to me means practicing small, daily acts of resistance. You have flight: If you have an exit plan, you activate it — and most folks do not. You freeze, and you pretend that everything is normal and that you pretend you can’t do anything. Or you fawn: You bend your knee and you kiss the ring and say, “I support this administration.”
I’m telling people, choose to fight and practice small, daily acts of resistance. Unfortunately, in this environment, celebrating Juneteenth is an act of resistance.
I believe that this moment is about both reclaiming the historical memory, but it’s also about a moment of looking forward, because if we stand right now and say that we’re not going to be erased, we are holding fast to our memory, we’re holding fast to our history, we’re holding fast to our contributions, then we’re laying the groundwork, setting up the framework for what’s going to come next.
What role have Black women played — historically and now — in defending and advancing the truth of our history against efforts to distort or erase it?
Black women have always been, as Zora Neale Hurston has said, “the mules of the world.” I talk about this as Black women being the ones that are willing to push and carry this country forward, because that is what we have done, whether it was during the time of American slavery trying to hold our family together, whether it was using quilts to stitch a road to freedom, whether it was braiding in routes to freedom in the hair of our children. Or as 19th-century women lifting as they climb, setting up club groups, raising money for the family, or coming today with the political activism that Black women have continued to be involved in and have continued to stand firm on trying to save this country, politically, culturally, socially and economically, for hundreds of years.
We’re at a moment now where a number of Black women are saying, “This is a moment that we sit out. We are tired. We’re exhausted. We’ve been teaching and reteaching the same lessons.” I’m making the argument that as much as I want to sit down, I cannot, as much as I want to stop I cannot. I can take rest breaks, but I do have to keep pushing the work, I do have to keep getting involved politically. I do have to keep talking about the reclamation of memory and history. I do have to keep standing up and resisting, even in very small ways. We are planting seeds for trees that will never give us shade. I am very clear that the work I’m doing right now is not work that I’m going to actually benefit from.
So then, what does rest, joy and celebration look like for Black women in this political climate? How do Black women hold space for both resistance and restoration?
That’s where Juneteenth comes in! Juneteenth is a great example of resistance and restoration. I’m telling Black women like I tell myself: No one’s asking you to fight 24/7, we’re not looking for that. Even Harriet Tubman rested. So where are the moments when you can actively get involved without draining your social battery? Maybe it’s an economic choice that you made. I can choose to vote with my feet, to vote with my dollars, write an op-ed. I can’t go out and march, but I can call into the radio station, I can give $5 to the institutions and the organizations that are holding up the work. That’s what restoration and resistance look like. You choose the moments when you can engage and then you practice radical self-care when you can’t — and be honest with yourself about what those moments look like.
For people who feel disheartened by the moment we’re in, what do you say about the power of showing up?
I’m gonna say this, and I know that it goes to the opposite of what a number of folks are saying right now, but our ancestors didn’t stop.
We can’t be the generation that stops. I know I’m tired, but I can’t be the one where the baton stops. As much as we want to stop in this moment, we have so much to lose. We cannot offer our children and their children a world that’s so destructive and just falling apart because we got tired and we stopped.
If Juneteenth is a mirror, what should we be reflecting on this year?
I would not say Juneteenth is a mirror; I would say Juneteenth is a prism into what we used to be, into who we are now, and into who we can be.
I think Juneteenth this year should be a space of radical imagination. It is clear that whatever this form of “democracy” has been, it does not exist anymore. I don’t want to go back to that. That was not a space of freedom, equality and diversity. That was not a space where we could rest.
So since that system is collapsing all around us, let’s use Juneteenth as a moment of radical imagination. What should come next? What exactly are we working for? Because at times I ask myself, “What am I fighting to save?” We need to have a plan for how we go forward, not their plan, but our plan.

(Courtesy of Carnegie Mellon University)Edda Fields-Black was working on a book about rice plantations when she came across the story of a raid in Beaufort, South Carolina, that freed more than 700 slaves from Lowcountry plantations.
The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.
She tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad.
So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
Harriet Tubman
Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.
“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
Finding the story
As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands who drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
‘All slaves are free’
Juneteenth – short for June Nineteenth – recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”
  The official handwritten record of General Order No. 3, preserved at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. National Archives.
Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted,
“Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
‘Second Independence Day’
June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

Legacies of slavery
While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”
National recognition
Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”

Backtracking on gains
But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of Dole Institute livestream)TOPEKA — The co-author of a national assessment of challenges faced by local election administrators focused on the failure of some Kansas counties to match rising costs of voting technology and election staff with budgets heavily reliant on property tax revenue.
The joint report from the Robert Dole Institute of Politics in Lawrence and the Edward Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in Boston provided election policymakers and administrators with data and research useful in arguing for more sustainable funding of local elections.
Zach Mohr, associate professor of public affairs and administration at University of Kansas and a co-author of the report, said 92% of funding for local elections in Kansas’ smallest population counties was derived from property taxes. He said the property tax was a steady source of money, but it didn’t keep pace with escalating costs.
“It might not be growing as much as we’d like, so that’s a bit of a problem,” Mohr said. “There’s probably a need for more diversification so that it can grow with the growing need. We may need more transfers from the higher levels of government.”
He said only 37% of Kansas counties studied had sufficient revenue to cover election expenditures in 2024.
It was a relief Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab forwarded $1.9 million in federal Help America Vote Act grants to 84 counties in 2024, Mohr said. The money was invested in advancing the physical security of elections and to address cybersecurity risks.
The Kennedy and Dole institutes’ report released Wednesday recommended creation of more stable funding streams drawn from local, state or federal sources. It argued local governments needed adequate staffing of offices and modern equipment to improve administrative efficiency and to maintain or earn public trust in elections. The report was produced with support from the Election Trust Initiative, a nonpartisan subsidiary of the Pew Charitable Trusts.
“Now, more than ever, the story of the election professionals who conduct our elections, often on a shoestring budget, needs our attention,” said Tammy Patrick, an advisor on the election administration project. “Administrators in cities and in rural areas; in red states, blue states and swing states; those who were elected, appointed or hired as a public servant; Republicans, Democrats and unaffiliated officials — all are better able to serve their voters and communities when they are sufficiently supported with the tools and resources the American voters deserve.”
The report said local government financed 85% of costs associated with administering elections, despite surveys showing the public believed federal and state governments were mostly responsible. The report said the budget for local elections represented 0.5% of the annual budget of local units of government.
“Half a percent is not much money at all to something that is the foundation and undergirds American democracy,” said Mitchell Brown, a professor of political science at Auburn University and contributor to the report.
The report said election offices, particularly in rural areas, too often faced personnel shortages and limped along on outdated technology. The debate about allocation of resources between urban and rural counties was complicated by the fact that 8% of U.S. election offices served three-fourths of the electorate.
Colorado’s cost-based reimbursement system for county-conducted elections could serve as a model for other states, the report said. In 2024, Colorado shifted to a model with state reimbursement of 45% of actual costs. The law allowed reimbursements to grow automatically over time in line with growth in election costs.
It replaced a system that allocated 80 cents or 90 cents per active voter to counties, said Hilary Rudy, Colorado’s deputy elections director.
“A per-voter formula fails to account for things like drastic changes in supply costs … or upgrading security requirements or new voting equipment,” Rudy said.
Ben Hovland, a member of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, said there was a need for the federal government to increase financial support for local election administration.
Large annual shifts in federal funding, often driven by emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, made it difficult for city, county and state governments to plan election budgets. The Help America Vote Act delivered $425 million in 2020 to the states, but the total dropped to $75 million in 2022 and $15 million in 2025.
“That trajectory is obviously headed downward,” Hoyland said. “We hear about a desire for that funding to be consistent and predictable.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Election-costs-Dole-report.png,,,2025-06-19 10:01:24.990212

Truth, a former slave and one of history’s most noted abolitionists who spent her last years as a resident of Michigan, is still remembered by her famous “Ain’t I a Woman” speech in 1851. But as historians believe her words may have been recorded inaccurately, Michigan Advance took a look at what she said during her later speeches at the Michigan Capitol in opposition to the death penalty. 


The life and legacy of one of history’s most famous abolitionists, Sojourner Truth, a former slave who spent her life evangelizing and rallying for a collection of causes is often condensed to four words “Ain’t I a Woman?”
But that rendering of her speech, where Truth’s words are written with a Southern dialect is not an accurate portrayal of what Truth, who grew up in Dutch-speaking Ulster County, New York, would have sounded like, historian and author of “Sojourner Truth: A Life, a Symbol,” Nell Irvin Painter told The Advance.

Painter and many other historians assert that the speech, as it’s recited in popular culture today, was incorrectly recorded by white journalist and abolitionist, Frances Dana Gage, which was published twelve years after Truth spoke at the Woman’s Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio in May of 1851.
And by the time Gage’s version of the “Ain’t I a Woman” speech became well known in the 20th century during second-wave feminism in the 1960s, Painter said American activists and culture demanded “authenticity” from Black people which erroneously dictated that Truth be a Southerner. 
“It’s such a crime that this person who was so thoughtful and so eloquent and so powerful a speaker should be reduced to a slogan,” Painter said. “I would like to abolish the sound bite, then I would like people to go beyond this sound bite.”
Truth was a gifted preacher and a stalwart defender of human rights, whether that meant women’s rights, temperance or abolitionism, she had a voice and she used it, Painter said.
And she utilized emerging technology to further her causes, selling photographs of herself when the technology was fairly new that had the inscription “I Sell the Shadow to Support the Substance“.
“It’s a picture of power. It’s not a fashionable picture, but it’s very composed and she decided how she wanted to be seen in those photographs. That’s the closest I could get to her self presentation,” Painter said.
Though she never learned to read or write, Truth dictated her life story to a friend who wrote her autobiography, for which she used the proceeds to travel around the country captivating audiences with her powerful speeches, Painter said.

Truth speaks at the Michigan Capitol
In the later years of Truth’s life, she put down roots in Michigan in the Battle Creek area, but that’s not necessarily common knowledge throughout the state, Michigan Capitol Historian Valerie Marvin told Michigan Advance.
“Truth is understood to be a national figure, and we often don’t think about where national figures live, because we just imagine them forever traveling across the country,” Marvin said. 
But Truth was a prominent political figure in Michigan who had become a legend by the time she started being asked to speak at the Michigan State Capitol on various topics, Marvin said.
There aren’t any known photographs from Truth’s June 2, 1881 speech from the state House rostrum in the Michigan Capitol condemning efforts to reinstate the death penalty, but by that time Truth had acquired such notoriety and intrigue that likely the chamber was filled with elected officials, capitol staff and members of the public to hear the famous speaker, then in her 80s, just two years before the end of her life.
It would be another decade before Michigan would have its first Black state lawmaker serving in the room Truth spoke in, but Marvin illustrates that there would have been plenty of Black individuals working in the chamber and around the Capitol, along with Black residents in the area that would have eagerly come to hear Truth speak.
An article published by the Lansing Republican five days after Truth’s speech offers its telling of her words where she opens by thanking God that despite all she may have been deprived of in life, she is still alive to call on her fellow Michiganders to maintain the abolishment of the death penalty, which Michigan had been the first state to abolish in 1846.
death penalty speech
“When I had thought for so many years that I lived in the most blessed state of the union, and then to think of its being made the awful scene of hanging people by the neck until they are dead. Where is the man or woman who can sanction such a thing as that?,” the article quotes Truth saying. “We are the makers of murderers if we do it.”
The portion of this speech that jumps out to Marvin as a hallmark of Truth’s willingness to speak her mind is early in Truth’s speech she says the idea that lawmakers were considering a bill to reinstate the death penalty jarred her so much that it “shocked” her “worse than slavery”.
“I think in Michigan, we think of the death penalty as something that’s kind of been dealt with because we’ve been talking about it for so long, going back to the 1840s, but I’m sure for many people who saw slavery as the penultimate issue of their day… there would have been eyes that would have gone wide,” Marvin said.
And though like her famous 1851 speech in Ohio, where history is largely at the mercy of the news articles written at the time, Marvin said she would like to think that the articles she’s reviewed, written in standard English, may be closer to reality, but ultimately no one knows.
“I think regardless of if she had a Dutch accent, regardless of the grammar she used, regardless of individual words she chose from one talk to another, she lived her convictions, and she dedicated her life to sharing those convictions with others,” Marvin said.
What Truth was able to do and say was unheard of, she was a power that demanded to be heard in a government for which she was not given a voice, Marvin said. And though it’s incredibly frustrating that Truth and many other great speakers who have given speeches in the state Capitol may not have their words 100% accurately recorded, Truth should not be relegated to one speech.
“Every person speaks within the context of their life, and your speech is just an audible declaration of something that you feel is worth saying. But how can you really tell who a person is? It’s not just by what comes out of their mouth, but how they live, and when you think about the decades that she invested in trying to educate people, in trying to preach to people, in trying to bring people around to what she saw as positive reforms, her life exemplified that movement,” Marvin said.
Truth’s is just one story of formerly enslaved individuals who utilized their story to call on the powers that be to change what was, but her presence in history is one of such elegance that it demands to be told in the full color for which Truth lived it, Painter said.
And the world is ready to look past the “sound bite” of the “Ain’t I a Woman” speech and delve deeper into who Truth and other Black voices of the 19th century were, Painter said. Recent pushback on diversity, equity and inclusion education and policies may make the curious of mind all the more curious about her story.
“Even when we think of how terrible our country can be, how terrible our times can be. We can take heart knowing that there were ordinary people who you look at them and you think, ‘oh, this person has no power’, yet those people empowered themselves,” Painter said. “ So you can see places in what looks like a totally impossible balance of power and you can see how people can get through. I find that very encouraging, that people can’t be dismissed…to go beyond what their situation condemns them to.”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Members of the U.S. Senate last week proposed a major sale of federal land as part of the “Big, Beautiful Bill” proposed by Republicans to fund the U.S. government.
If adopted, the proposed sale could be significant for Alaska, where the federal government owns and manages 61% of all land in the state.
Under language proposed by the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service would be required to sell between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public land across 11 Western states, including Alaska.
National parks and monuments would be off limits to sale, but wide swaths of Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land would still be available.
The proposed language states that the sold land “shall be used solely for the development of housing or to address associated community needs,” and that the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture can determine whether the sold land is being used for an appropriate purpose.
The land-sale provision is being boosted by lawmakers who say it could alleviate high housing prices in Western states. Since 1998, for example, the BLM in Nevada has operated a successful land-sale program that has created thousands of homes in and around the Las Vegas area.
Staff for Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the new land-sale language would allow a similar effort nationwide.
But environmental groups, including the Wilderness Society, are opposing the sale provisions. 
For the moment, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee proposal is only a draft, but it’s one of a number of ideas with potentially major impacts in Alaska.
While the Senate’s proposed cuts to Medicaid and food stamps have been widely discussed, the energy and lands components of the bill may be just as significant.
“If we get everything that we’re trying to get in it … I think this will probably be one of the most important pieces of legislation for Alaska in our state’s history,” said U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, in a prerecorded Wednesday address to the Resource Development Council in Anchorage. 
It would affect policies related to oil development in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, as well as other resource development, he said.
“ANWR, NPR-A, timber, Cook Inlet, you name it, it’s in there,” he said.
Murkowski, also speaking in a recorded message, said that within Congress, she, Sullivan and Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, are all working on the budget reconciliation process.
“We’re going to refill TAPS,” she said, referring to the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, “we’re going to produce more of our minerals. We’re fighting for a sustainable timber industry, and we’re going to keep harvesting the best seafood and welcoming millions of visitors every year as we come together to secure our resource future.”
Oil and gas drilling
If the Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s text is adopted, the federal government would be required to hold four oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, east of Prudhoe Bay, between 2025 and 2035. 
The language of that section mirrors a section proposed by Murkowski in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which resulted in two lease sales that drew minimal interest from bidders.
The federal government would also be required to hold six lease sales in Cook Inlet by 2035. Again, bidders have shown little interest in prior sales.
More significantly, the federal government would be required to hold six lease sales in the NPR-A, to the west of Prudhoe Bay, by 2035. Development restrictions imposed by the administration of former President Biden would be lifted.
Oil companies have been interested in NPR-A development, with ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project being the largest recent effort in the area.
Importantly for the state, the committee is proposing that Alaska receive 90% of all rentals and royalties from oil and gas leasing on North Slope federal land starting in fiscal year 2035, an increase from the current share of 50% of royalties. The same 90% share would apply for Cook Inlet leases.
The state would continue to receive 50% of royalties, rental fees and other bonuses before 2035. Currently, most of those royalties go to communities on the North Slope.
If the royalty change is adopted, it would have significant positive effects for state finances. Currently, Alaska subsidizes development in NPRA via tax credits, but the lack of royalty revenue means that the state’s subsidy will take many years to be paid off. 
The Alaska Legislature voted by a combined 57-2 margin to support a resolution asking for the 90-10 split to be adopted by Congress.
The committee’s proposal also would lower the federal royalty rate — which was raised by the Biden administration — diminishing the amount of money the state would receive under successful leases.
Ambler Road
Section 201 of the committee’s proposal would approve a right-of-way permit for the proposed Ambler Road, which would connect the Dalton Highway to a mining district in Northwest Alaska.
The Biden administration opposed the project, but the congressional language would take matters back to where they stood in 2020, said Murkowski staff members.
The Ambler Road remains in litigation, with lawsuits by environmental groups opposing it, and lawsuits by the state and Alaska’s state-owned investment bank supporting it.
Logging
One section of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee concept would significantly increase the amount of logging required on federal land. The U.S. Forest Service would be required to significantly increase the amount of timber sold to loggers, and the Forest Service would be required to sign at least 40 long-term timber sales contracts involving national forests.
Those kinds of long-term sales contracts contributed to the establishment of Southeast Alaska’s pulp mills, which relied on harvests from the Tongass National Forest. 
Most timber harvests from the Tongass currently are exported internationally without processing in the United States.
The Bureau of Land Management would also be required to enter into long-term timber harvest contracts with buyers.
Land sales
Section 301 of the committee plan requires the Bureau of Land Management to sell between 0.5-0.75% of eligible land and for the Forest Service to sell 0.5-0.75% of its eligible land.
The land eligible for sale doesn’t include national parks, preserves, landmarks, or land that’s already subject to a “valid existing right.”
For example, land already earmarked for transfer to an Alaska Native corporation, the state of Alaska, or the University of Alaska isn’t available for sale. Land that’s being leased for timber sales, mining or oil and gas drilling also isn’t available for sale.
In Alaska, the language requires that local Alaska Native tribes be consulted before a land sale, and it states that the sold land “shall be used solely for the development of housing or to address associated community needs.”
In a written statement, Sullivan said he sees the energy and natural resources committee’s land-sales provision as important for Alaskans.
“Alaskans are keenly aware of how the federal government’s ownership of 60 percent of Alaska’s lands can inhibit economic development and cause challenges for our communities, like exacerbating the severe shortage in affordable housing,” he said in the statement. “I worked to ensure Alaska’s federal lands are eligible under the ENR amendment, which will give us the opportunity to free up some Forest Service and BLM lands for additional housing, including lands around Southeast and Southcentral Alaska communities that are seeing a surge in demand due to the historic build-up of our military and Coast Guard assets.”
Sullivan said the language, and Trump’s presidency, offer a “historic opportunity” for the state, and if the bill’s language becomes law, he would work with the state to make the most of that opportunity.
In Southeast Alaska, many communities have high home prices and are surrounded by Forest Service lands. 
Municipal officials in Ketchikan have asked for the release of some federal land, particularly on nearby Gravina Island, for homebuilding. 
In Juneau, city officials are looking for available land, but city manager Katie Koester expressed skepticism that Forest Service land is buildable. 
“That land is mostly mountains and ice fields … and if it were flat and easy to develop, it’s also far away from utilities,” she said.
“I just don’t see a lot of easily developable land that is owned by the federal government,” Koester said.
Maps published by the Bureau of Land Management show some available Forest Service land along the road leading to Juneau’s ski area, Eaglecrest, and some in a swampy area near one of its shopping malls.
She added that there may be individual parcels, here and there, that may make sense for development, “but our community, our Assembly, has been very vocal about public land staying in public ownership.”
In Anchorage, Mayor Suzanne LaFrance has launched a major homebuilding campaign, but the mayor’s office there said they’re not certain whether a federal land sale would help.
Under the language proposed by the Senate committee, and using maps published by the BLM, the Campbell Tract appears to be the largest piece of salable land in urban Anchorage. Some parts of Eagle River south of the spur road and north of the river also appear to qualify for sale.
“The BLM’s Campbell Tract is a recreational gem for Anchorage, providing residents and visitors with year-round access to undeveloped space and an extensive trail system,” the mayor’s office said in a written statement.
“We are open to using other federal lands suitable for housing development in areas not already used for recreation or other valuable purposes — for example, any unused, federally-owned parcels within the developed part of the Municipality.”
Where things stand
Ordinarily, a bill would need 60 votes in the Senate to bypass its filibuster rule. But Republicans are advancing the “Big, Beautiful Bill” under a complicated process called reconciliation. 
If successful, the process means that a bill can pass with 51 votes, or 50 if it’s supported by the vice president’s tiebreaking vote. 
Reconciliation starts when the Senate and House adopt a resolution that says how much they want to spend on the federal budget or change taxes.
Then, the Senate directs its various committees to come up with ways to make spending fit within that resolution, reconciling what the federal government is doing with what Congress planned.
Each Senate committee drafts a proposal for the federal departments that it oversees. 
That’s where the Senate process stands right now.
Next, each committee’s work is examined to see whether it follows the Byrd Rule, which sets six tests to see whether an item can be done in reconciliation. 
If a particular item fails one of those tests, it gets stripped out. Colloquially, in the Senate, this is known as going through the “Byrd bath.”
When that’s done, what follows is a “vote-a-rama,” where the Senate votes on each committee’s language and senators have a chance to offer amendments.
Because of limits on the time allowed for debate, the votes often proceed quickly.
Once the Senate is done with its work, its version of the budget must be combined and compromised with a different version that has gone through a similar process in the House.
Once the House and Senate have agreed on the same version of the budget, it goes to the president for his signature.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is taking Juneteenth off and will return to your inboxes on Monday.
From CalMatters technology reporter Khari Johnson:
When Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed California’s most high-profile artificial intelligence regulation last fall, he simultaneously asked the state’s deep bench of AI researchers to recommend guardrails that balance safety and innovation. The result of that work, The California Report on Frontier AI Policy report, was released earlier this week.
The report stresses transparency-focused regulations such as whistleblower protections and audits by independent third-parties — mirroring a draft of the report released in March. It also highlights how AI has changed in the past three months, including improvements in its ability to act independently and to help people make dangerous weapons or carry out cyber attacks. 
In one example, a language model from the AI company Anthropic threatened to blackmail engineers and tell their partners they cheated on them, according to an evaluation by the company. Another assessment found that highly advanced AI models, known as “frontier models,” can tell when they’re being evaluated. 
These reports do not indicate an immediate risk, but underscore the speed of progress of the technology, and that such risks must be taken seriously, said Scott Singer, one of the report’s lead writers, in an interview with CalMatters.
The California Legislature is considering numerous bills to regulate AI, including measures that require online platforms to label AI-generated content and mandate protocols for how chatbots deal with people who talk about self harm. Another prevents developers from blaming AI for harm in court. State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, said in a statement that his office is considering which report recommendations to incorporate into a bill that protects AI whistleblowers.
The report does not address a decade-long pause on state AI regulation beyond encouraging coordination with other governments to avoid the compliance burden for businesses that Republicans in Congress used to justify the proposed moratorium.

No curfew, more troops

Despite protests winding down in Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass ending the downtown curfew and the local police department reporting no arrests related to the demonstrations since Saturday, President Donald Trump’s administration said Tuesday it is deploying 2,000 more California National Guard troops into the city.
The mobilization follows the administration’s June 9 order, bringing the total number of National Guard troops in L.A. to 4,100. A federal appeals court case to determine whether the troops can stay in L.A. under Trump’s command is still ongoing. 
Meanwhile, California’s food and restaurant industries — which employ about 1.42 million people as of April — have been rattled by the immigration raids, write CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay and Lauren Hepler. 
Some restaurants have closed temporarily, street vendors have gone into hiding and food festivals and farmers markets have been canceled. Adriana Gomez Salazar, who is able to work legally in the U.S. and is the owner of an Altadena-based food truck, said she had to shut down her business for now to protect herself and her workers.

Salazar: “I have no idea how long I’m going to be shut down for. Trump can say a lot of things (about pausing ICE raids) but he has also said he wants to do the biggest mass deportations in history.”

Senator may sue Sacramento police department

A month ago, state Sen. Sabrina Cervantes was involved in a car accident near the state Capitol, after which Sacramento police officers accused her of driving under the influence. The Riverside Democrat immediately denied this, and was exonerated after a blood test proved she had no drugs or alcohol in her system.
Cervantes is now considering suing Sacramento police, arguing that her arrest was “politically motivated.” The police department, however, says officers “remained professional throughout.”
Between these two conflicting narratives, it’s difficult for the public to determine which is the most accurate.
As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow and Jeanne Kuang explain, authorities are refusing to release records about the incident. CalMatters has requested body camera footage, police reports and search warrants, but has so far been denied the records from the police department and the county’s district attorney’s office.
David Snyder, the executive director of the First Amendment Coalition, said it is concerning that officials are refusing to release information related to a criminal investigation of an elected public official, and that “the public is entitled to see what the police know and what they believed at the time.”
Meanwhile Cervantes is “100% behind any and all records being released,” according to her attorney.

To help California’s struggling film industry, Gov. Newsom wants to increase the state’s investment in film and television tax credits. CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu and video strategy director Robert Meeks have a video segment on why legislators from both sides of the aisle oppose the proposal. Watch it here.
And check out another video from CalMatters’ Rachel Becker and Robert about the backlash facing another Newsom plan to fast-track the $20 billion Delta Tunnel project. Watch it here.
SoCalMatters airs at 5:58 p.m. weekdays on PBS SoCal.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Though Newsom and legislators agree about how much to fund schools, they are neglecting to address the state’s chronically subpar academic achievement.
Many Californians are quick to criticize the state as a “hellscape,” while remaining seemingly unaware of what true “bad” governance entails, writes DeAndre Evans, an Arkansas native currently residing in San Diego.

Some food trucks, farmers markets and small restaurants are temporarily closed, while others are shielding workers and raising funds to help.



Brandon Mejia usually spends his weekends conducting a symphony of vendors serving pupusas, huaraches and an array of tacos at his two weekly 909Tacolandia pop-up events.
Half food festival, half swap meet, the events draw 100-plus vendors a week in Pomona and San Bernardino. They offer a way to “legalize” street food — vendors get a reliable location, cities collect taxes and enforce health codes — while patrons enjoy delicacies from all over Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Spanglish music plays, people dance and kids flock to facepainting and pony rides.
But in the past week, that’s all come to a screeching halt. As the Trump administration ramps up immigration raids in California, some restaurants, worried about their workers or finding that customers are staying home more, are closing temporarily. Many street vendors are going into hiding, and some food festivals and farmers markets have been canceled.
Mejia called off all Tacolandia events last week. His mind raced about whether agents would come for his vendors as videos surfaced on social media of taqueros, farm workers and fruit vendors vanishing in immigration raids around LA and neighboring Ventura County. 
“A lot of these vendors, their goal is to have restaurants. They want to follow the rules,” said Mejia, who was born and raised in San Bernardino in a family from Mexico City. But after conferring with vendors, they decided the risk was too high: “Some people have told me that their relatives have got taken, so I don’t want to be responsible for that.”
After a week of mass protests and more raids at farms, grocery stores and at least one swap meet, Mejia and many others remain on edge. Mejia said some small food businesses are getting desperate, trying to decide whether to risk reopening or stay closed while their own families grow hungry.
The disruptions come at a difficult time for California’s restaurant industry, which is already grappling with soaring costs for ingredients, labor, rent and regulatory requirements. In Los Angeles alone, more than 100 well-known restaurants closed last year, the Los Angeles TImes found — all before the immigration raids that industry leaders warn could further hamstring the industry.
In California, the food and restaurant industry employed about 1.42 million people as of April — a sizable workforce that is being affected regardless of the immigration status of its workers. That includes nearly 600,000 people who work for full-service restaurants.
Jot Condie, president of the California Restaurant Association, called immigrants “the lifeblood of our industry.”
Confusion over Trump orders 
President Donald Trump and his administration have sowed confusion: Late last week, the president posted the following on social media: “​​Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.” That led to reports that his administration would pause most raids on restaurants, farms and hotels. 
This week, those exceptions were reversed.  
“The President has been incredibly clear,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, in an emailed statement to CalMatters. “There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE’s efforts.” McLaughlin said “worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts.”
When CalMatters asked whether worksite raids would target only those with criminal records, the agency did not respond.
“I’m following it step-by-step,” Mejia said of the administration’s announcements. “I fall under those categories — hospitality and restaurants. But the thing that scares me is he said he’s going to go to the biggest cities — LA, Chicago, New York. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”
Brandon Mejia (center), shown at his 909Tacolandia pop-up, started the event after he said a 2023 hit-and-run car crash left him with severe nerve damage and unable to keep working as a chef. He shut down the events last weekend because his vendors fear LA-area immigration raids, and now he and the vendors are debating when to reopen. Photo courtesy of Brandon Mejia.
A food-truck owner in the Pasadena area who has had to shut down said she has a hard time trusting what the president says. 
“We feel like (Trump is) not being honest,” said Adriana Gomez Salazar, who was 4 years old when she came to the U.S. from Mexico and has been able to work legally for years without fear of deportation as a DACA recipient. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, established under President Barack Obama, is facing legal challenges.
Salazar had to shut down her Altadena-based food truck, LA Cajun Seafood Boil, after the January fires. When she reopened, she said customers were scarce because the area needs to rebuild. She was not eligible for a Small Business Administration low-interest disaster loan because she’s a DACA recipient, something she said is frustrating because she is a taxpayer just trying to make a living. 
Now, Salazar has had to shut down again to try to protect herself and her workers — and because many customers are staying home out of fear of the ICE raids. She is trying to bring in income from catering jobs and has started a GoFundMe to try to raise money not just for her but for an employee who is out of work now. 
“I have no idea how long I’m gonna be shut down for,” she said. “Trump can say a lot of things (about pausing ICE raids) but he has also said he wants to do the biggest mass deportations in history.”
In the LA neighborhood of Wilmington, a farmers market also has closed down. “Due to increased ICE activity in Wilmington, many of our farmers are scared and have chosen not to attend… We do hope to one day reopen… but for now, we must step away,” according to a Monday post on the Wilmington Farmers Market’s Instagram page.

Similar stories and concerns have emerged up and down the state. San Diego restaurant Buona Forchetta was the site of a “traumatic raid,” the restaurant’s owners recently confirmed in a statement. They had to close for a couple of days.
In the Bay Area, restaurant owners and industry groups are anxious and bracing for possible impact on their workers and businesses. 
Owners educate workers about their rights
An owner of a Mexican restaurant in the historically Latino Mission District in San Francisco, who requested anonymity over fears his restaurant and workers could be targeted by ICE, said he has gone over possible scenarios with his employees in case federal agents enter the restaurant. 
He has a sign that clearly says “employees only” beyond a certain point. Beyond the sign, it’s not a public space so his employees are supposed to be safe there, he said. 
His employees also know the agents need to show a warrant, and that they should check the name on the warrant. They also know to try to stop the agents verbally as well as to use hand gestures, so his security system’s cameras can pick it all up for possible evidence later.
His employees all had the necessary paperwork when they were hired, but he can’t be sure of their immigration status.
“I don’t want to assume anyone’s undocumented,” he said. “I have no reason to question them.” 
He said all he can tell them is to be careful out there, especially now. “I told them I’m careful because I look very Mexican,” he said. “So know your rights when you’re out on the street.”
According to an estimate by the Migration Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, more than 250,000 undocumented immigrants in California worked in the accommodation and food services, arts, entertainment and recreation industries in 2019.
Condie said the California Restaurant Association is working with the National Restaurant Association to push for federal immigration reform, which includes providing pathways to legalization for those who are undocumented and creating a temporary worker visa program.  
The Golden Gate Restaurant Association, which has about 800 industry members mostly in San Francisco, is focusing on disseminating information to try to quell some of the anxiety.
“This fear is really causing stress on families, workers, and also on customers,” said Laurie Thomas, the association’s executive director.
“The hospitality industry, the backbone of it, is mainly made by immigrants. My dad was an immigrant until he got his citizenship. It hits close to home.”ULISES PINEDA-ALFARO, CHEF-OWNER OF EL BARRIO CANTINA
Besides the possible personal and financial toll on workers and owners as a direct result of the raids, she said protests against the raids could mean double trouble for restaurants, which have very tight margins: They have to prepare for the possibilities of a lull in business, violence and vandalism, too. 
Thomas is tracking the changing directives coming from the Trump administration. “Until there is clarity regarding ongoing actions, there will continue to be a high degree of stress in our community,” she said. 
Some California restaurant owners are remaining defiant — and open. In Long Beach, El Barrio Cantina chef and owner Ulises Pineda-Alfaro decided that his restaurant would offer the community a place to gather and take a break from doom-scrolling. 
After a few calls to popular Mexican-owned liquor brands, he also came up with a way to give back to those on the frontline. For $13 last weekend, customers could get the restaurant’s taquitos de papa and either a margarita or a whiskey sour, with 100% of proceeds going to local immigrant rights group Órale.
“The hospitality industry, the backbone of it, is mainly made by immigrants,” Pineda- Alfaro said. “My dad was an immigrant until he got his citizenship. It hits close to home.”
By last Friday, an Instagram post announcing the deal had more than 50,000 views, and Pineda-Alfaro said about a dozen people were waiting outside when the restaurant opened for lunch that day — a welcome sight as other pockets of the city sat empty. 
“I have seen some vendors and some other restaurants closing early or not opening at all,” he said. “We’re embedded in the community, hence our name. We’re going to remain open.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/043025-Street-Vendor-LA-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-19 09:02:14.937267

Many states simply ignore their problems,DeAndre Evans,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/californians-should-give-government-credit/,"An Arkansas native who relocated to California worries many citizens are internalizing the culture war disdain for the Golden State, and willing to tear down what makes California exceptional.","Guest Commentary written by

DeAndre Evans
DeAndre Evans is an Arkansas native currently residing in San Diego. He moved to California to further his software engineering career.


As I navigate my new life in California, there is a question that echoes in my mind. There’s a subtle, almost reflexive sympathy that surfaces from California natives when I mention my home state of Arkansas. It’s a quiet acknowledgment, as if I’ve survived some hardship and finally reached a haven.
I can’t entirely knock this sentiment since California’s reputation as a beacon of progress and opportunity is largely earned. It is, by many metrics, one of the nation’s leading states. Yet as a newcomer who has experienced a starkly different civic landscape, I’ve perceived a troubling undercurrent: A willingness among some Californians to dismantle the very structures that make this state exceptional.
The litany of criticisms is familiar — negativity that seems to originate far beyond California’s borders but somehow latches within. Issues like homelessness, gas prices, public transit, the cost of living and the efficacy of state government are relentlessly portrayed as unique, catastrophic failings. The narrative suggests California is a “hellscape” where businesses cannot thrive and citizens suffer under uniquely oppressive conditions. 
However, a crucial piece of perspective is often missing: These problems, while significant, are not exclusive to California. The sheer size of the state amplifies their perceived magnitude here and, in my view, by a persistent smear campaign. One that many Californians seem to be internalizing.
Take homelessness, a deeply complex and visible crisis. Yes, it is a significant problem in California’s urban centers. But California is also one of the few states actively, if imperfectly, attempting to address it with substantial resources and a multi-pronged approach that includes housing initiatives and support services. 
In Arkansas, the response is often a shrug of administrative shoulders, a “good luck” or, more disconcertingly, the criminalization of poverty. There, the problem is less visible not because it’s smaller proportionally, but because it’s often swept under the rug or into the correctional system.
The perennial complaint about high gas prices often ignores the deliberate policy choices behind them. California’s specialized fuel blend, while costlier, is a critical component of its efforts to combat air pollution in densely populated basins. 
This commitment to environmental quality is further underscored by the state’s unparalleled electric vehicle infrastructure, support programs and adoption rates. It offers a stark contrast to states where fossil fuel interests often dictate policy with little regard for long-term ecological consequences.
Public transit, another frequent target of criticism, is a marvel from my perspective. While the high-speed rail project has faced undeniable setbacks, exacerbated by global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the vision persists. More importantly, California possesses a functioning, diverse transit ecosystem encompassing subways, light rail, extensive bus networks and dedicated bike paths. 
In Arkansas, comprehensive public transit is largely a foreign concept, often limited to university towns sharing minimal services with the wider populace. The idea of a state-level strategic transit plan is almost unimaginable.
The high cost of living is an undeniable reality. However, this is intrinsically linked to California’s economic dynamism, desirability and the high demand for its quality of life, amenities and progressive social environment. While the housing crisis requires urgent and innovative solutions, the “low cost of living” in states like Arkansas often comes with significant trade-offs: lower wages, fewer economic opportunities, a dearth of specialized services and a less robust social safety net. 
It’s a classic case of getting what you pay for, or perhaps, what you collectively invest in.
Frankly, it was the perception of state government that compelled me to write this. Many Californians appear remarkably quick to criticize Gov. Gavin Newsom and the broader state apparatus, seemingly unaware of what genuinely “bad” governance entails. 
There’s a pervasive readiness to vote against the very policies and leadership that have cultivated the state’s defining advantages: its robust safety nets, comprehensive social programs and commitment to environmental preservation and public access. The legalization of cannabis, the staunch defense of reproductive rights, the preservation of public coastlines — these are not accidental outcomes. They are the direct result of a progressive, albeit imperfect, state government that actively legislates to protect and enhance the lives of its citizens. 
My governor was Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Yes, that one. Arkansas voted for her instead of a nuclear engineering and urban planning doctorate — who was also religious. 
After living under a state government often characterized by inaction, regression or outright hostility to such progressive values, California’s governance is a relative model of responsiveness and foresight.
Do not let externally crafted propaganda and internal frustrations, however valid some may be, blind you to the substantial, hard-won progress California represents. The problems are real, but the foundational structures and the political will to address them are more robust here than in many other parts of the country. Cherish that. Engage critically, demand improvement, but do not be so easily convinced to tear down a framework that, for all its flaws, still stands as a comparative bastion of progress in a nation facing profound challenges. 
You may or may not know how good you have it, but you’re close to finding out what “bad” truly looks like.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/070523-Street-Medicine-Project-LV-CM_36.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-19 09:02:14.937267

(Photo courtesy of Carnegie Mellon University)Edda Fields-Black was working on a book about rice plantations when she came across the story of a raid in Beaufort, South Carolina, that freed more than 700 slaves from Lowcountry plantations.
The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.
Fields-Black tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
Harriet Tubman
Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.

“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
Finding the story
As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands that drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

I think that ’twixt the negroes of the South and the women at the North, all talking about rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what’s all this here talking about?
That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain’t I a woman?
Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain’t I a woman?
I could work as much and eat as much as a man — when I could get it — and bear the lash as well! And ain’t I a woman?
I have borne thirteen children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother’s grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain’t I a woman?
Then they talk about this thing in the head; what’s this they call it? (Member of audience whispers, “intellect.”) That’s it, honey. What’s that got to do with women’s rights or negroes’ rights? If my cup won’t hold but a pint, and yours holds a quart, wouldn’t you be mean not to let me have my little half measure full?
Then that little man in black there, he says women can’t have as much rights as men, ’cause Christ wasn’t a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.
If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again!
And now they is asking to do it, the men better let them.
Obliged to you for hearing me, and now old Sojourner ain’t got nothing more to say.

Although the Emancipation Proclamation had been issued two years earlier, it wasn’t until this date — two months after the Civil War ended — that all those enslaved in Texas learned they were free. 
Union Gen. Gordon Granger delivered the news to those enslaved in Galveston that the Civil War had ended: 
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.” 
His announcement put the Emancipation Proclamation into effect. The news set off celebrations and continued to be remembered in the years that followed. The day became known as “Juneteenth,” which became a legal state holiday in Texas in 1980. In 2021, Juneteenth, also known as “Freedom Day,” became a national holiday.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06104045/June19-update-Juneteenth22_Banner_final.jpg,,,2025-06-19 09:02:14.937267
,California,2025-06-19 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,"California politicians agree on school money, but poor test scores need attention",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/california-school-spending-test-scores/,The Legislature's and governor's budget proposals agree to spend $80 billion on schools. There've been few discussions about how to boost students' persistently low test scores.,"Historically, the annual process of writing a state budget has often stumbled over how much money California should spend on its public school system and its nearly 6 million students.
However, as Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders negotiate a final budget for the 2025-26 fiscal year, dealing with a multi-billion-dollar deficit, they have only small disagreements on school finance.
Both Newsom’s latest budget and the Legislature’s alternative draft would peg state spending on schools at $80.5 billion, including transitional kindergarten, a new education subcategory.
That’s $4.5 billion less than the current budget allocates, but with anticipated increases in education’s share of local property taxes, total spending would remain roughly even.
With schools off the table, politically, Newsom and legislators are wrangling over more contentious issues, particularly the reductions in medical and social services for poor, elderly and disabled Californians that Newsom seeks to close the budget gap.
The comity on school spending, however, shuns a debate that California’s politicians should be having — what to do about the system’s chronically subpar academic achievement.
This week the Public Policy Institute of California issued a timely reminder that there’s been little progress — and some regression — in such basic skills as reading and mathematics, with wide gaps among students tied to family income, ethnicity and other socioeconomic factors.
In an analysis of state academic tests that were administered last year, PPIC researchers reported that fewer than half of all students “met or exceeded state standards in English Language Arts, while about a third (36%) did so in math.”
The analysis also found that “proficiency rates were highest among Asian students: just above 70% in English and nearly two-thirds in math. White students’ rates were lower, with 60% meeting the standard in English and 50% in math. Proficiency rates were lower on average for Black and Latino students — 24% and 37% in English, respectively, and 18% and 30% in math.”
Also girls fared much better than boys in English. And proficiency in basic skills among low-income students is scarcely half that of those from moderate- or high-income families.
To cap it off, PPIC notes that California students’ rates of proficiency in federal tests continue to lag behind those of other states.
None of these findings is unexpected. California students have been lagging behind the state’s expectations and national norms for many years, even as spending on the school system has continued to climb to well over $20,000 a year per pupil from state aid, local property taxes and federal subventions.
One would think that California’s stubbornly mediocre — at best — education outcomes would sit atop the political agenda, given their negative effects on students and the state as a whole.
However, the Capitol’s discussions of education usually start and end with how much money schools should receive, when it’s obvious that school finances, while important, are just one factor in outcomes.
There are some signs of progress on those other factors, such as a recent agreement to encourage local school systems to use phonics in teaching elementary students how to read, the most important of all academic skills.
While the state is stopping short of mandating phonics, as many education experts advise, it’s a step forward that more or less declares a winner in the very long debate over methodology that’s been dubbed “reading wars.”
However, there’s also been some regression. As PPIC notes in its study, the state Board of Education, which tends to reflect the education establishment’s priorities, has adopted new definitions of academic test proficiency that could obscure embarrassingly low results. For instance, if a student scores below grade level,  their performance will be labeled “Developing” or “Minimum.”  
“Understanding student scores could be growing more difficult,” PPIC says. That’s not a good thing.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061825_St-Hope-Charter-School_MG_CM_31.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

Seven candidates have filed for New Mexico's next top executive, and a few are already campaigning. (Austin Fisher / Source NM)Three Democrats, three Republicans and a “declined to state” candidate have filed the paperwork seeking to be New Mexico’s next top executive in 2026 but, with more than a year to go, the lineup remains in flux.
Current Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is barred by state law from running again, as she finishes up her second consecutive term.
The primary election will be held June 2, 2026, and the general election is in November, but the campaigns are already a multimillion-dollar undertaking. Deb Haaland, the former U.S. Secretary of the Interior and New Mexico congresswomen — who formally announced in February — in May reported raising $3.7 million from 51,000 donations.
Sam Bregman, the 2nd Judicial district attorney, who announced in April, surpassed $1 million in donations, according to campaign officials in May. He previously told Source he felt confident he could manage his day job while running for office: “I’m sure of it because of the team I have in place; I’m sure of it because I have a leash on every day called the iPhone, which is a computer itself,” he said. “I’m the district attorney 24-7, 365 and I always will be, as long as I have this job — and I know I can do the job and run for governor.”
While candidates will likely be on the trail this summer, it will be months before the public will see fundraising and spending reports. New Mexico campaign finance filings are collected in April and October outside of election years.

Since her February announcement, Haaland has garnered endorsements from all members of the New Mexico delegation, save fellow Democratic U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich — who took himself out of the race in January —  in addition to local and state representatives. The campaign recently announced 10,000 volunteer sign-ups, according to Felicia Salazar, a spokesperson for the Haaland campaign.
“New Mexicans are excited about Deb’s vision for the future and are lining up to help get her elected,” Salazar said in a statement.

Bregman has secured endorsements from the Albuquerque Police Officers Association, LiUNA Local 16, the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, Iron Workers Local 495, and the Teamsters Local 492, according to his campaign.
“I’m humbled and energized by the overwhelming support,” Bregman said in a May 16 press release.

Ken Miyagashima, the former governor of Las Cruces, told Source NM in a text he’s been fundraising since announcing his campaign on May 28, but said further details would be released at a later time.
After much speculation, Lt. Governor Howie Morales announced recently he will not embark on a gubernatorial campaign, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family.
“My family is extremely important to me, and I didn’t want to sacrifice that time for the rigor and the travel and the pressures that come from a governor campaign,” Morales told Source NM.
Morales was demure about a future endorsement, noting he called all three Democratic candidates to let them know his decision not to run.
“I did share it is too early to even consider weighing in on an endorsement,” Morales said.
The GOP

Rio Rancho Mayor Greggory Hull thus far remains the only Republican candidate to fully confirm his campaign for governor, but he postponed his formal announcement after his campaign issued a news release, stating it is still in a “strategic growth phase.”
Hull, who has been Rio Rancho’s mayor since 2014, has reported raising a little more $206,000 according to campaign finance documents.
Hull did not respond to Source NM texts, emails, calls or social media messages for comment.
Brian Cillessen, a 53- year-old Farmington resident, veteran and hunting show host, filed the paperwork, but told Source NM he still has not declared his candidacy.
“There is plenty of time to decide, but we want to ensure we have a path toward success,” he said in an email Wednesday.

Duke Rodriguez, CEO of Ultra Heath Cannabis and a former cabinet secretary for former Republican Gov. Gary Johnson, told Source NM he’s “95%” towards making a decision, and said he’s leaning toward running for governor, but will not commit yet to the announcement. Rodriguez showed Source NM a texted endorsement from Johnson.
Rodriguez, 67, said his beliefs “clearly align with Republicans when it comes to free enterprise, economics, capitalism and reduction in crime,” but said his commitment would be to “reduce poverty in New Mexico.”
He said unaffiliated voter participation in primaries for the first time cannot be understated, noting that nearly one-third of voters are registered as “decline to state,” and he’d be seeking their votes.
“I don’t think you could just simply ignore them anymore,” he said.
 
Decline to state
Gene Pettit, a nondenominational pastor in Radium Springs, told Source NM he is filing as a nonpartisan because “I don’t much like what the parties are doing right now, and our state is in trouble.”
Pettit, 63, has not run for any public office previously.
Pettit said he would make a formal announcement later this year and further develop his platform, but said his platform will center on “bringing God back into the state.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250618_124201-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

(Courtesy of City of North Las Vegas)Growing up in Chicago Deborah Evans – founder of Juneteenth Nevada – didn’t know about the holiday despite living about 10 blocks from one of the largest annual parades in the city. 
“I never happened to be on that street at the time that they had the parade,” said Evans, who moved to Las Vegas two decades ago. 
After learning about Juneteenth Day as a high school computer teacher, she picked up her camera to document her first parade and has been promoting the holiday ever since.
“We are still probably the stepchild of holidays,” Evans joked. “Twenty years later, I’m still picking my own pockets to make things happen.”
Efforts to advance the recognition and education of Juneteenth Day hit a snag last week when Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed Assembly Bill 328, a bill that would have established a Juneteenth Educational and Economic Commission within Nevada’s Department of Tourism and Cultural Affairs.
“I’m quite disappointed,” said Evans, who has lobbied for a Juneteenth commission to help educate the public on the history of Juneteenth since 2023, when a previous version of the bill failed to make it out of the Legislature.
A Juneteenth commission would provide a dedicated space to research and preserve the history of Juneteenth Day while spreading awareness about the holiday, said Evans. 
The bill would have created a fund within the treasurer’s office, allowing local governments to voluntarily contribute funding for the development and coordination of formal celebrations for Juneteenth Day.
It has been four years since former President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, and two years since Lombardo signed a bill making it a state holiday. 
Yet, community activists believe that much about the history and meaning of the holiday has been buried.
Juneteenth marks the historic moment that the last recorded enslaved Black Americans were freed by Union soldiers in Galveston, Texas, two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
“We want to expand the information that’s been hidden and written over,” Evans said. “There’s so many names of people that we need to talk about that our children are not aware of.”
Currently much of the work to preserve and promote the holiday in Nevada is done without state-backing by volunteers, like Evans. The Tourism and Cultural Affairs department, which supports yearly cultural events in Nevada like Lunar New Year or Day of the Dead, could help the holiday grow.
Each June, Evans helps coordinate community celebrations and run education campaigns in honor of Juneteenth. On Wednesday, Evans gave a Juneteenth proclamation presentation during a flag raising ceremony in North Las Vegas along with Mayor Pamela Goynes-Brown and U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford.
In his veto message, Lombardo argued the bill “creates an implicit obligation that may pressure local governments into making financial contributions simply because they choose to observe Juneteenth.”
“While honoring Juneteenth is a worthy goal, we must approach new spending and mandates with care, especially during a period of economic uncertainty and increasing budgetary pressures.” Lombardo wrote.
No local governments in Nevada spoke in opposition to the bill. 
Lawmakers who sponsored the bill said Lombardo’s concern the bill would create an economic burden for local governments celebrating Juneteenth were meritless.
“There’s no evidence that it would create a local burden,” said state Sen. Dina Neal (D-North Las Vegas), who cosponsored the bill.
Local governments are already committing funds to cultural events for Juneteenth Day, she added. A Juneteenth commission would only formalize those efforts and allow donations and more collaboration for the holiday.
“This was just a furtherance of the local work that had been going on for a long time. Most of the local Black leaders have just been creating and funding and doing everything from scratch,” Neal said. 
“Maybe he’s not in tune with the Juneteenth events, and maybe he should attend one,” she continued.
Assemblymember Reuben D’Silva (D-North Las Vegas), a co-sponsor of the bill, noted that the Juneteenth commission bill wasn’t the only multicultural bill vetoed by Lombardo. 
The governor also vetoed bills to establish observance days for several Asian holidays,  designate July as “Muslim American Heritage Month,” and created a day of observance for labor leader Dolores Huerta.
“There’s probably political reasons for that, I would wager,” D’Silva said. “This falls more in line with the overall broader aim to really veto and mitigate any kind of diversity or cultural inclusion bills that came out of the session. That’s what I really feel. This bill fell victim to that, along with all those other ones.”
D’Silva said he spoke with elected officials from the cities of North Las Vegas and Las Vegas throughout the session who were supportive of the bill.
“The cities themselves have budgets for this,” D’Silva said.
Neal and D’Silva said they plan to bring the bill back during the 2027 session. 
“If you don’t continue to share what has happened to the generation that came before you, then the information is no longer used or available for those groups to understand ‘where did you come from and what have you actually gone through?’ That’s why that bill mattered,” Neal said. 
A Juneteenth commission could help bring together businesses, nonprofits and community groups to educate the public about the significance of Juneteenth Day, Evans said. She hopes a successfully expanded Juneteenth Day celebration will also bring new economic activity and energy to North Las Vegas and other Nevada cities. 
Evans said she was proud the bill got farther during the session this year than in 2023, when it failed to even make it to the governor’s desk. She’s optimistic it can be signed into law next session. It’s a marathon, not a sprint, said Evans. 
In 2011, Nevada lawmakers passed a bill recognizing Juneteenth as a day of observance. It would be 12 years before lawmakers successfully moved a bill through the Legislature to make Juneteenth a state holiday. Evans and Juneteenth Nevada played an essential role in both.
“We are not going to stop promoting this commission, because it is a step towards education, inclusion and economic growth in all directions,” Evans said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-18-at-10.50.35 PM-1024x574.png,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

There has been much discussion about the move of the Food not Cops lunch distribution at the parking garage downtown. What has not been mentioned in all the articles I have read is the work that COTS, one of Chittenden County’s largest providers of services to the unhoused, does and has been doing for 40 years.
I am sure it is an oversight but anyone who isn’t aware of COTS services may think the only place for our unhoused in Burlington to get lunch is in the parking garage.
COTS Daystation, located at 95 North Avenue, is open every day serving a sit-down lunch at 12:30 p.m. An average of 75 people eat lunch daily. 
And COTS does more than just provide a hot meal. In addition to the warm welcome from our passionate staff, COTS provides a safe warm or air-conditioned location, computer access, access to services, phone access, a mailing address, laundry and shower access.
These meals are provided by community volunteers who donate their time to prepare meals in our kitchen and more volunteers are always welcome.
COTS is also a connection point for shelter and housing. COTS has two family shelters and an adult shelter. COTS Daystation also provides a space for service providers to engage with those who may be ready for engagement.
You will find Turning Point, Howard Center’s Street Outreach Team, UVM Health, Pathways and the VA at our Daystation. At COTS you will find community and connection to our community’s services.
COTS has been feeding, sheltering, housing, connecting and caring for our community members for many years. They are a small organization that provides many services, beyond lunch. One of the best things about our Daystation is that while our unhoused community may stop in for lunch, they may leave with shelter and connection to services.

CAHOKIA HEIGHTS — Arianna Norris, 63, paid cash for her home in Cahokia Heights. For as long as she’s lived there, during intense rainstorms, water surrounds her property and last year her basement started flooding.

Norris was around four years ago when residents in Alorton, Cahokia, and Centreville voted for the merger that created Cahokia Heights and disbanded the Commonfields of Cahokia Public Water District. The merger was an effort to address the sewage overflows that have plagued the area for decades, thanks to leaky pipes and broken equipment in the aging system that allow raw sewage to escape, flooding homes, streets and businesses.

But given her experience with months-long floods last summer, Norris is skeptical that the city’s sewer system will ever be fixed, even with the merger’s promise— that combining the three cities would give Cahokia Heights  a larger population and a shot at multi-million dollar federal grants for repairs.

She knows the city has applied for grants, received some of them, and completed some work. She sees crews making repairs, but she also still experiences flooding.

“They might as well have just taken a match to it,” Norris said, of the grant money  “I know they spent it, but I don’t know where.”

Like other smaller communities, the city’s still relatively small tax base and fewer resources hinder its ability to pay for the kind of multimillion dollar projects that could resolve overflows.

It is among five dozen communities in Southern Illinois and the Metro East that account for a third of sanitary sewer overflows reported to the state of Illinois within the last decade, according to data from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. Unless authorized by a permit, sewer overflows into U.S. waters are violations of the U.S. Clean Water Act, which the Illinois EPA enforces.



Explainer: What is a sanitary sewer overflow?
Sanitary sewer overflows, SSOs, are a release of untreated or partially treated waste from a city sewer. Sanitary sewer overflows are illegal. But when normal systems become overloaded through heavy rain or a larger load from an increasing population, SSOs occur. When they occur, they must be reported to the Illinois EPA. SSOs can be caused by blockages, line breaks, sewer defects, power failures, improper sewer design, vandalism, or groundwater overloading the system, as is often the case during heavy rainfall. Learn more.




Cahokia Heights tried the 2021 merger and applications for numerous grants to remedy the problem with mixed results. Other communities with overflow issues have tried approaches like selling parts of their sewer systems.

Yet for Norris and others in Southern Illinois, the overflows persist.

While these residents wait for relief they continue to endure property damage, fear and distrust of the drinking water and damaging health impacts.

Surrounded by sewer water

As of 2020 when an engineering report on sewer repairs was completed, Cahokia Heights needed to repair or replace at least 800 feet of sewer pipes, six sections of water main, 19 fire hydrants, eight lift stations, and more than 50 pump stations according to grant applications submitted the following year.

The estimated cost: more than $24 million.

A third of the majority-Black population of Cahokia Heights lives below the poverty line. The community’s median household income is $37,975 — less than half of the state’s median. As of publication, Illinois Answers had not received a requested copy of the city’s most recent budget.

Poorer areas and communities of color often face the greatest risk when it comes to sewage backups, flooding, and access to clean drinking water. Decades of infrastructure disinvestment and neglect can exacerbate problems with old sewer systems, and expensive home repairs from flooding damage or cleanup are tough to make on a limited income.

Two out of the three former cities that make up present-day Cahokia Heights had wastewater collection and transport systems built in the 1980s that have been poorly maintained, according to the Illinois EPA. The newly merged city sits in the Mississippi River floodplain, located about 30 minutes east of St. Louis.

Between 2014 and 2024, the city accounted for a quarter of all sanitary sewer overflow reports submitted to the Illinois EPA by permittees not regulated by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program, according to data obtained from the agency. Those with NPDES permits are allowed to discharge into waterways so long as contaminants are below a certain level.

But a lag in enforcing SSO reporting from more rural communities until recent years may contribute to the issue.

“Historically any time a new requirement comes down the pipeline, it seems like larger communities are the first ones tested for compliance,” said Cody Moake, chief of staff to the Marion mayor.

The sewer system in Cahokia Heights as a whole is still broken and the overflows happen despite repairs. Attorneys with Equity Legal Services, who represent citizens of Cahokia Heights in multiple lawsuits, said residents report that repairs are made but fail within weeks or months.





Other repairs made flooding worse in some residents’ yards and houses.

Last summer during a storm, Norris’ house was surrounded by water for six weeks, and another resident was without hot water for over two weeks after the flood destroyed her hot water tank, according to the complaint filed by attorneys. Within a week, St. Clair County, where Cahokia Heights is located, was declared a disaster zone by the U.S. government.

Solution: A merger to secure more funds

Since the 2021 merger, more than $35 million in grants have been awarded to Cahokia Heights, according to Illinois EPA data. The data indicates an estimated $200 million would be needed for flood mitigation and to repair or replace sanitary sewer and drinking water systems.

The agency aggregates this data from multiple sources, and a disclaimer attached to the data states that there is “no assumed review of accuracy or completeness by EPA.”

Almost $12 million in awarded grants comes from federal agencies including the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, funds earmarked by U.S. Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth and from the American Rescue Plan Act.

But securing the funds is only part of the battle.

To use these funds, Cahokia Heights has to apply to the various agencies that control the money for approval on how it’s spent.

When applying for a grant, cities have to provide information about how the money will be spent and preparing those plans isn’t cheap. For example, preliminary engineering on two parts of the sewer system over the last two years cost the city more than $400,000, according to invoices from Hurst-Roche, a Hillsboro-based engineering firm.

In Johnston City, about two hours south of Cahokia Heights, officials secured a $68,000 grant from the Delta Regional Authority to map out the sewer system in anticipation of applying for a larger grant, Mayor Doug Dobbins said. The DRA is a federal-state collaboration established 25 years ago to invest in basic public infrastructure in eight states along the Mississippi River.

Dobbins said getting the grant would have been impossible without help from a pro bono grant writer.

An overflow complaint from Johnston City was reported to the Illinois EPA in November of last year citing “dead fish, black water” and “a foul odor.” When EPA staff investigated, they didn’t find dead fish, but noted in a report that repairs were needed to prevent future basement backups. In response to a records request, the Illinois EPA found no Johnston City sewer overflow reports from the last five years.

Dobbins said the November break was an equipment malfunction and “could happen with an old or a new valve.” The break came about a week after record rainfall once again hit the region.

Prior to the overflow, Dobbins said, city staff were developing a replacement plan for the city’s wastewater treatment plant, which began providing service in the early 1980s with an estimated 25-year lifespan. It’s nearly 50 years old.

Keeping an older plant running can cost cities money, too, he said — when equipment would break, sometimes they’d find that the parts needed were no longer made, and they had to pay for a custom fabrication.

Without the no-cost grant writer, Dobbins said he doesn’t think the city would be considered for most grants.

“What takes [a grant writer] three hours would take us three weeks,” Dobbins said. He’s still unsure if the entire plant needs replacing, or just parts of it, but he anticipates a request from state officials in the near future for a plan.

Even if the preparation to make repairs gets done, a small tax base means some funding is out of reach. Grants can require a 50/50 split, meaning a municipality has to pay for half of the project and the agency providing the grant pays for the other half.

“And there’s no doubt in my mind that this project starts with an ‘M,’” he said, referring to the millions he thinks it’ll take to repair or replace the wastewater plant in Johnston City.

“We’re a retirement community,” Dobbins said. “We can’t afford that.”

In Carterville, about two hours south of Cahokia Heights, Mayor Bradley Robinson said the city has spent $1 million just on engineering for the city’s proposed new wastewater treatment plant.

State and federal intervention has had little effect.

Only a fraction of the money sought for Cahokia Heights projects has been spent. Why? May 30, 2024 — The Belleville News-Democrat follows the money and asks questions about why it’s taking a while for the city to receive and spend the money it’s been awarded in multiple grants.

How aging water systems are pushing sewage into U.S. homes Oct. 25, 2024 — The nonprofit organization Science Friday features Cahokia Heights and explores how aging infrastructure can result in sewage backups and flooding.
Plan calls for $30 million in Cahokia Heights sewer repairs. Residents say it’s not enough Dec. 10, 2024 — After authorities announced the proposed settlement agreement for the sewage and flooding issues in Cahokia Heights, residents expressed their misgivings about it.




In December, five years after the sewage overflows and severe flooding began getting  widespread attention in the press, the Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul joined a lawsuit, along with the U.S. Department of Justice and the state and federal environmental protection agencies on behalf of Cahokia Heights residents.

As a part of the enforcement, the agencies filed a consent decree that, according to a release from Raoul’s office, “requires Cahokia Heights to pay a $30,000 civil penalty and invest approximately $30 million in extensive sewer improvement projects, conduct system-wide repairs and ensure the community is updated with its progress on upgrades.”

But “the 15 years doesn’t even include [a requirement for] the system being fully functional,” said Nicole Nelson, an attorney for Equity Legal Services, which represents Cahokia Heights residents in a separate lawsuit.

The decree also provides a caveat: If Cahokia Heights “demonstrates that an SSO would not have occurred but for the conditions in the City of East St. Louis sewer system,” the city won’t be obligated to fix the source of the overflow. The two cities’ systems are connected.

In overflow reports from East St. Louis, none blamed Cahokia Heights, but in the last 10 years, eight Cahokia Heights reports cited the East St. Louis system as the cause. A wastewater treatment plant in the nearby village of Sauget also cites East St. Louis in reports as a contributor to overflows there.

Precipitation and equipment failures were cited as causes of overflows in East St. Louis.

But Dawayne Stewart, assistant finance director for East St. Louis, said “there’s never been a comprehensive study” of where sewer problems are located in the city. On April 10, the East St. Louis City Council considered an agreement with an engineering group to complete a sewer study, but it died without any votes.

“We’re still having a ton of problems,” Stewart said. In June, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources announced a $2.6 million plan to buy out flood-damaged properties in East St. Louis citing “stronger and more frequent storms.” In December, state and federal authorities filed suit against overflows in the city of East St. Louis.

Robert Betts, city manager of East St. Louis, declined to comment, but said the “proper functioning of the sanitary and storm water sewer system is of paramount importance.

Meanwhile, with slashes to federal funding targeting environmental projects, federal support for these fixes is at risk.

The main sources of funding for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure are the U.S. EPA, the Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  through programs like the Safe Drinking Water and Clean Water state revolving funds. The Associated General Contractors of America, a construction association, calls these federal funds “highly successful but chronically underfunded.”

U.S. Representative Nikki Budzinski, whose district includes Cahokia Heights, is worried after she said she learned that the Trump administration had plans to cut staff from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, potentially including those who manage natural disaster response.

In April, Budzinski visited Granite City, about 20 minutes north of Cahokia Heights, to meet with residents and criticized Republicans for federal cuts. The cut funding included over $1 million  for part of the project in Cahokia Heights. The city’s engineer said the cut funding would have gone toward separating the Cahokia Heights and East St. Louis systems — they will now have to start the appropriations process again.

In early June, the Illinois EPA announced nearly $10 million in combined grant programs for sewer overflows and watershed management. This comes months after the Illinois Answers Project began requesting records and asking the agency about sanitary sewer overflows.

The state of Illinois also provides funding for sewer infrastructure projects through community development block grants and other grant programs, like the unsewered communities planning grant program announced by the Illinois EPA at the end of last year.

Solution: Fix the Harding Ditch

Despite the consent decree mandating system-wide repairs, a lawyer for Cahokia Heights has attributed the city’s sewage problem to homeowner mismanagement in past court filings.

But an Illinois Answers review of the Illinois EPA overflow reports found only a sixth of the reports made by the city attribute overflows to equipment failures, from line breaks to pumps failing. Three quarters of the reports cite heavy rain or snow melt — or stormwater — as causes.

Stormwater and lack of maintenance of the infrastructure meant to contain it — such as canals or ditches designed to prevent flooding by allowing surface water to drain into them — adds to the overflow problem.

In Cahokia Heights, stormwater eventually flows to several larger ditches, including the Harding Ditch, an 11-mile-long drainage ditch that runs through several Metro East communities.  Two years ago, the mayors of Cahokia Heights and East St. Louis said solving the flooding problems would be tough without remediating the Harding Ditch.

The Harding Ditch is maintained by the Metro East Sanitary District, and is the “primary drainage path” for the southern part of the Metro East levee system, with multiple tributaries that empty into the ditch, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

“The ditch network is supposed to channel water from the ditches into the levee system,” said Kalila Jackson, one of the Equity Legal Services attorneys. “But because the ditches are not clean, they’re not dredged, they’re not properly maintained. They’re dammed up.”

Fixing the stormwater issues will cost millions, according to lawsuit documents. Patricia Greenwood, 75, has lived her entire life in her home in the Piat Place neighborhood. In that neighborhood alone, the current estimate is $12 million or more.

“Yet the city has only applied for two grants to address the stormwater infrastructure across all neighborhoods, one of which was rejected and the other still pending,” according to court filings.

Fixing the Harding Ditch alone could cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take longer than a decade, according to local engineering firms.

At a November MESD board meeting, Tom Schooley, the attorney representing the board, said “By being proactive and cleaning the Harding Ditch, it helps our position in the litigation,” referring to the suit brought by Centreville Citizens for Change against the city of Cahokia Heights and MESD.

In the same meeting, Schooley announced the closing of a $8.4 million deal with Illinois American Water which provided MESD with funding to begin work on the Harding Ditch.

The deal transferred the responsibilities for two MESD-run sewer systems to Illinois American Water, a private water company that has increased its sewer footprint in the Metro East in recent years. MESD no longer owns or operates any sewer systems.

It would have cost too much to fix the systems, said former board president Scott Oney. The board tried to apply for a grant to do so several years ago, but if the grant had been secured, it would have meant an increase on customers’ bills, Oney said. The board decided the best course of action, then, was to sell the two systems to Illinois American Water.

Solution: Selling to Private Water

When repairing and replacing old systems to prevent sewer overflows becomes too expensive, they can become business opportunities for private water companies like Illinois American Water.

Such companies benefit when there is less federal funding for water systems, said Bryan McDaniel, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer rights advocacy group. When systems are in disrepair, they are more likely to be sold to private companies.

In 2013, Illinois passed a law allowing private water companies to purchase public water systems and pass costs on to consumers. An amendment to the law in 2018 extended it for another decade and also removed a limit on the size of water systems that private companies can buy, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Illinois American Water has pledged that it can and does make repairs and investments that “would not be feasible for a single community to take care of on its own,” according to an email from company spokesman Terry Mackin. In two systems purchased by the company since 2019, hourslong sanitary sewer overflows were reported years after the purchases were completed.

In Cahokia Heights, Illinois American Water doesn’t own any of the sewage system, but the company owns about 20% of the drinking water system in former Alorton and Centreville, which it owned prior to the city merger.

Illinois American Water raised rates twice, in 2023 and this year, on customers in Cahokia Heights. In the first increase, bills rose by almost $7 per month, and in the latest hike, bills increased by $15 per month. Both were attributed to “infrastructure projects statewide,” according to an email from Illinois American Water spokesman Terry Mackin.

Since 2010, the company put $10 million into the portion of Cahokia Heights’ drinking water system that it owns, Mackin’s email said, and another $139 million in “replacements and updates” at the regional East St. Louis water treatment plant, which provides drinking water to Cahokia Heights and other Metro East communities.

The remaining 80% of the drinking water system there is owned by Cahokia Heights, Mackin confirmed. The city purchases water wholesale from Illinois American Water, and owns and operates the water distribution and delivery system, including customer service and all infrastructure.

Illinois American Water announced two years ago that it met requirements of a U.S. EPA order to improve drinking water safety in Cahokia Heights. It applies only to the part of the system the company owns.

“Our actions showed that the issues in Cahokia Heights are about wastewater and flooding and not drinking water service from Illinois American Water,” Mackin’s email said.

Still, William McNeal, 73, a Cahokia Heights resident and a customer of the company, said he doesn’t trust the water that comes out of his faucet. Greenwood, also an Illinois American Water customer, doesn’t trust hers, either. They both use bottled water.  In the email, Mackin wrote that  the company works with customers “individually and directly” when they’re contacted regarding water quality issues.



[gallery type=""columns"" columns=""2"" size=""medium"" jnewsslider_zoom=""true"" ids=""71575,71574,71573,71572""]



Using bottled water is a “consumer’s decision,” he wrote, and “for Illinois American Water customers, it is not necessary for health and/or safety reasons.”

“Heavy rain in recent years in the River Bend has presented challenges in wastewater overflows,” Mackin wrote. “Community wastewater systems, in general, are not built to handle the high volume of rain in recent years in this area.” Mackin also wrote that the company has invested approximately $58 million in Alton since acquisition and $10.8 million in Jerseyville, the two systems that had hourslong overflows after the company purchased them.

“It takes time to analyze, review, design, build and implement improvements,” Mackin wrote.

Solution: Generating funds locally by raising the bills

In Murphysboro and Marion, located about two hours south of Cahokia Heights, where locally generated funds are having some impact, former city officials put service fees on wastewater bills years ago in anticipation of future repairs.

“We only have sanitary sewer overflows when we have an extremely heavy downpour,” said Will Stephens, Murphysboro mayor since 2013. The city of 7,000 is about ten minutes west of Carbondale.

Stephens credits the former Murphysboro mayor for putting a $10 assessment on water bills in the late 2000s to prepare for future infrastructure needs. That money effectively helped finance a loan through the Illinois EPA to build a new wastewater treatment plant completed almost a decade ago.

Within the last few years, Murphysboro also began replacing sewer lines using cured-in-place pipe, he said, and the city financed that work with ARPA funds. This method of pipe repair inserts new material into the pipe to replicate its shape, where it hardens in place.

In Marion, sewer lines were replaced with the same cured-in-place method, Moake said. Those repairs, plus drier weather, have helped bring the number of sewer overflows reported to the Illinois EPA down in Marion from more than 100 three years ago to 24 last year.




Construction on Marion’s sewer lines (provided by Cody Moake)



Marion is financing the repairs with a debt-forgiveness loan from the Illinois EPA and there’s been a debt service fee built into customers’ sewer bills, now $12.31, for decades, Moake said.

The median household income in Marion is $57,281 — almost $20,000 more than the median income in Cahokia Heights. Greenwood showed Illinois Answers copies of three bills totaling $100 that she pays each month for water treatment, water service and sewer service.

Even a $10 per month increase would be a hardship.

“We would have to cut some things out at the grocery store, or gas in the car, or going places,” Greenwood said. “That’s extra money.”

Murphysboro residents expressed similar sentiments in 2005 after sewer bills saw a $10 increase.

Yet the overflows persist

While some communities, like Murphysboro, have found promising solutions, residents in Cahokia Heights and other cities in Southern Illinois and the Metro East are trying to find ways to cope while they wait for solutions they fear may never come.

Represented by Equity Legal Services and environmental justice organization EarthJustice, Cahokia Heights residents are embroiled in two separate lawsuits regarding the sewer overflows. The lawsuits were filed in 2020 and 2021 and are separate from the federal and state agencies’ actions against the city.

The Equity Legal Services team provides McNeal, and dozens of other households with multiple cases of bottled water each month. McNeal said he uses it to cook, drink and brush his teeth.

It’s enough water for him, he said. But he just wants to be able to turn on his tap and trust what comes out.

When there’s substantial rainfall, like there was in April, a sewage overflow next to McNeal’s house turns into a smelly river.

It’s a mix of wastewater and stormwater, and McNeal never knows exactly how contaminated the water is; just that somewhere in the flow, there’s raw sewage. The overflow spills out of the pipe and runs alongside his house, bordering his backyard where he tends a small garden of greens.

His kids want him to sell the house and move, or leave without selling it, he said, but McNeal’s not planning on doing either.

“I worked for this,” said McNeal, whose home is paid off. He shared the same sentiment with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch five years ago when the situation in Cahokia Heights received a flurry of media coverage. Little has changed since then.

The river that springs up next to his house during pounding rain frustrates him. But the water bills bother him even more.

“The killing part is they steady send you bills, and they said the water was treated and I could drink it,” McNeal said.

McNeal said repairs made near his house earlier this year stopped bathtub and toilet backups. But the pipe in his yard still spews water when it rains.

Authorities acknowledge relief may still be years away. In an update last September on the two remaining lawsuits against Cahokia Heights, lawyers for the U.S. DOJ and the Illinois Attorney General’s Office wrote “due to the long-term nature of sewer infrastructure upgrades, some SSOs [sanitary sewer overflows] will likely continue to occur.”

The federal and state attorneys are not party to the lawsuit but were “willing to aid the court in its understanding of this matter.”

In response to emailed questions from Illinois Answers about enforcement in Cahokia Heights and East St. Louis, Illinois EPA spokeswoman Kim Biggs said because the municipalities are in joint enforcement with the Illinois EPA, U.S. EPA and the DOJ, she could not comment further.

Multiple attempts to reach Cahokia Heights officials were unsuccessful.

The continued overflows with no end in sight are not news to residents who live with them. They wait in their flood-prone homes, anticipating another soggy Illinois wet season.

At the home of Cornelius Bennett, one of the residents who originally sued the city in 2020, a new backflow preventer, which prevents contaminated water from flowing back into the clean water supply, ended up causing more issues.

“When it rains hard and/or consistently, the top of his backflow preventer pops off due to the pressure of the system and raw sewage sprays everywhere. He keeps bricks on top of the preventer to stem the flow of sewage that escapes,” a November court filing said.

Norris said her basement flooded for the first time last July after a repair was made nearby. Flooding surrounding her home was common during rainstorms.

Norris feels like giving up, some days, though she thought she’d retire peacefully in Cahokia Heights.

She spends her time working part-time at the Cahokia library and pushing for relief from the overflows. Though she’s exhausted, and she didn’t think she’d “have to go back into fighting mode” in retirement, she’s digging her heels in and is determined to stay. Others, she says, may be running out of steam.

Norris has been to several town hall meetings on the water and sewer projects held by city officials over the years. Attendance at the meetings was once robust, she said, but waned as time went on. The meetings were “minimally advertised,” attorneys said, and they did not see much community engagement.

“It is heartbreaking and sometimes it can be almost soul crushing because you feel like you’re up against it,” Norris said. “That’s the worst part is the feeling that nobody cares.”


Methodology: How we reported this storyIllinois Answers examined a decade’s worth (2014-2024) of sewer overflow data and reports obtained from the Illinois EPA. In response to a Freedom of Information Act seeking sanitary sewer overflow data for the time period, two spreadsheets were provided.

Reports are submitted to the agency by governments when an overflow occurs. For some entities — those not permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System — Illinois EPA staff enter the data from the reports into a spreadsheet for internal tracking purposes. The reports are entered manually by Illinois EPA staff within one week of receipt, said Illinois EPA spokeswoman Kim Biggs. The internal tracking spreadsheet is not public.

Another spreadsheet represents overflows reported by NPDES permittees. SSO reports from NPDES permitted facilities, which are those that discharge to waters of the U.S., are entered into the U.S. EPA’s Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS) database. That database is public, and is where the spreadsheet provided to the Illinois Answers Project came from.

The PDF reports submitted by government agencies, including cities, villages, and sewer districts, were obtained through a series of separate Freedom of Information Act requests. The reports were used to corroborate information in the spreadsheets provided by the Illinois EPA and fill in gaps of time where reports of overflows did not appear in the spreadsheet.

For example, years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 were missing entirely from one spreadsheet.

“Our staff did do additional checking and unfortunately could not find any spreadsheets with those years for your request,” Biggs said. For localities named in Illinois Answers Project stories, PDF reports were requested for the missing years and manually entered by Illinois Answers Project staff into a copy of the spreadsheet.

The reports are handwritten and provide the authors some latitude to describe conditions. If there are ranges provided — for example, if “8 to 24 hours” is provided for duration of overflow — the lower end, 8, was entered into the spreadsheet.

If “unknown” was entered on the form in a space, that value is shown in the spreadsheet. If it was left blank, it is blank in the spreadsheet. When dates were not correct in the spreadsheet or the report showed a different date, they were corrected with the date shown on the report.

When multiple overflows were reported for the same day, even if the rows of data for each overflow were identical and no PDF reports were returned for those records, the rows were not dropped from the spreadsheet because a permittee can have multiple overflows in different locations in one day. In several of those cases, the date of the overflow was the same, but location of the overflow or other important details — amount discharged, what happened to water discharged — differed.

For records in both spreadsheets:

Some rows in the spreadsheets — each row represents one report — matched the reports provided exactly.

Other rows in the spreadsheet existed but efforts to obtain PDF reports for that overflow record were unsuccessful. For some — including ten reports submitted in Cahokia Heights — reports were returned in a Freedom of Information Act request but corresponding rows were not in the spreadsheet. In that case, rows were added to the spreadsheet for data analysis purposes. Reports with no corresponding rows were found more often for overflows occurring in earlier years, prior to 2020, when cases in Cahokia Heights were filed and began to make news.

The form to submit a Sanitary Sewer Overflow to the Illinois EPA can be found here.

I’ve been following Charity Clark’s activities — and those of the other attorneys general, along with groups like Common Cause and the ACLU — closely in recent months.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nicholas Boke: Charity Clark’s town hall meeting in Chester.","This commentary is by Nicholas Boke of Chester. He is a freelance writer and international education consultant.


It’s been quite a while since many of us have felt so positive. 
We — the very active members of the Chester Town Democratic Committee and others — have been busy ever since Trump took office. Trump’s inauguration got the half-dozen stalwarts who showed up for monthly CTDC meetings to jump to twenty-five virtually overnight.
In January, we created committees that dug into everything from educational reform to legislative activities to “In case of fire,” which met with regional nonprofits in case of floods, or if Trump’s activities made Vermont less safe. CTDC organized and publicized demonstrations: Hands Off!, then May Day Strong and No Kings.
But nothing has had quite the impact that the June 9 hour-and-a-half presentation by Vermont’s Attorney General Charity Clark had. When her mother, who lives in Chester, suggested that the AG might be willing to speak here, the CTDC speakers’ series committee got in touch with Clark’s people, reserved the town hall, told the police chief what was planned and spread the word. 
Clark was to explain at some length what she’d been doing, and then respond to questions people had written and given to the moderator. 
Some hoped that MAGA folks would come, while others feared they might disrupt things. A dozen or so waited on the green outside the town hall amid signs that read “AG Clark — Lawless and Reckless” and “AG Clark Defiles Her Oath of Office.” I asked if any were going to come hear what she had to say. “Some of us will,” I was told. 
Charity Clark really knew what she was doing, and nobody tried to “disrupt” anything. After being introduced by select board member Arne Jonynas, she spoke to the 70-some people for 20 minutes, then opened for questions.
By my count, there were 25 questions. Some focused on details of the 14 lawsuits (as of this writing) that she and the 24 state Democratic AGs had set in motion. There were also questions about the nature of due process, what ICE could demand of local law enforcement members, and what Trump’s sending the National Guard into the LA demonstrations might mean. 
By my count, six of the questions came from people who were trying to unsettle her. There was one about how many “illegals” there were in Vermont — Clark said she preferred the term “undocumented people” and that she didn’t know, because it wasn’t within her bailiwick.
Several people asked how much the lawsuits were costing. “Nothing,” she said each time, explaining that protecting the people of Vermont was her and her staff’s job, the lawsuits being designed to do just that. What about drugs and crime in Vermont? She responded that her office had sued large drug sellers and manufacturers, but didn’t take on the local problems. 
And so on. 
When she didn’t have an answer, she said so. She periodically reminded the audience that the midterm elections were coming up, that protests and letters-to-the-editor matter, that although Trump always pushes back he eventually complies with court orders. 
I’ve been following Charity Clark’s activities — and those of the other attorneys general, along with groups like Common Cause and the ACLU — closely in recent months. Such people seem to be all that stands between our fragile, flawed democracy and a burgeoning oligarchy of the rich, an autocracy that would ignore the millions of people at the other end of the economic spectrum, to say nothing of protecting those desperate to escape an oligarchy elsewhere. To say nothing of protecting moderately “safe” folks like myself.
Mostly though, this brave woman who is on the firing line of what some are already calling a constitutional crisis is working hard to make sure the country does not slide fully into chaos and/or dictatorship. 
Donald Trump, she began the evening by saying, “has an utter contempt for the rule of law.” But, she went on, “This is America. No man is king.” Her job, she explained, “is to protect Vermont and protect the Constitution.”
She believes, she told WCAX last week, that “President Trump … is testing the boundary of his power as president, and it’s up to the courts to lay the boundaries and say, here’s what the Constitution says you can do.” 
I and lots of others left the Chester Town Hall comforted, more hopeful than we’ve been for a long time because this courageous woman is hard at work.

I read, with interest, the letter from Lonnie Poland of Milton regarding the makeup of the body of elected officials in Milton.
My first reaction was, “sour grapes.” She has run for office in Milton and should be commended for that, but she lost.
The immediate issue her letter addresses is how the selectboard seat recently vacated by Chris Taylor should be filled. Chris was recently appointed town manager and, as such, was required to vacate his selectboard seat.

Ultimately, all seats on the board will be filled by candidates that the majority of voters believe represent their own views on town matters. That’s how democracy and representative government work. That is how Chris Tylor gained his now vacated seat.
Any interim appointment to fill that seat should ethically be a candidate who best represents the views and qualifications of the predecessor who was chosen by the voters. That choice should not be based on gender, diversity, lived experiences or even party affiliation as she has inferred.
That is what the voters deserve, expect and will ultimately get.
Sincerely,
Wendell P. Noble
Milton

(Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Secretary of State Diego Morales faced intense scrutiny from state lawmakers on Wednesday about his myriad of controversies while seeking additional funds for his office related to cybersecurity, election oversight and securities duties.
Legislators — both Democrat and Republican — asked him specifically about his spending on no-bid contracts and international travel, the latter of which has been criticized for mixing personal business with state duties. 
“My work ethic is unmatched,” claimed Morales. “I’m going above and beyond the call of duty and we will continue to do so.” 
Other Morales controversies mentioned in the Wednesday meeting include: purchasing a $90,000 car with taxpayer money from a campaign contributor and hiring his brother-in-law.
While in India to speak at two tech conferences in March, Morales missed a key budget meeting — a particular point of contention for lawmakers — and didn’t disclose the trip, or its funders, until later. Last month he went to Hungary on a “personal trip” paid for by a conservative group but also spoke as Indiana’s Secretary of State. 
This week, he brought an entourage to ask for $10.2 million more, with Chief Legal Counsel Jerry Bonnet handling most technical questions. 
Morales, whose office is not tasked with promoting the state abroad, said he believed he and other Hoosiers “need to showcase our state” and “talk about Indiana the same way people talk about other states” internationally. 
  Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, asks Secretary of State Diego Morales a question on June 18, 2025. (Madelyn Hanes/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“I want people to talk about Indiana. I want them to know Indiana is open for business,” said Morales. “… The media should be saying, ‘Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for promoting our state out there.’”
The Secretary of State’s Office registers both domestic and international companies operating in Indiana.
Sen. Fady Qaddoura said the missed budget meeting invited additional scrutiny, saying that such behavior in “most professional places” would impact an employee’s standing. 
“I’m disappointed in your leadership and the way you’re leading your office,” said Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis. 
“It’s unfortunate that I get judged for a couple of things here, but what about the rest?” Morales asked in defense.
“That’s the nature of being a public servant,” Qaddoura responded. 
Morales also claimed he visited all 92 counties faster than other statewide office holders, which he cited as a reason why his office needed the luxury vehicle. He went on to say he’d put so many miles on it — “more than two secretaries of state combined” — that he’d been advised to retire the car for “safety” purposes. 
“You have a vehicle that costs almost twice as much as the average salary of the average Hoosier,” said Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown. “I think we need to pay attention to optics here…”
Morales also didn’t directly answer Garten’s question about campaign contributions related to the additional funds he sought from the committee, saying “lots of people” donate to his political efforts. 
Though he had an intense line of questioning, Garten flashed Morales a thumbs-up gesture after the committee approved the additional funding. 
 Where will the $10.2 million go?

“The office has taken significant measures to contribute to efforts to save money,” Morales said, putting those identified cuts at $2 million.
Morales cited newly enacted transparency requirements to publicize contracting, a rule which will apply to all agencies, as a reason his office needed additional dollars. In the past, the officeholder has taken criticism for his reliance on no-bid contracts, likely inspiring the legislation.
“I’m extremely disappointed that it took legislation to get us there,” quipped Garten. 
That, combined with the budget agency directive to withhold 5% of funds, triggered the appearance before the budget committee, Morales said.

The bulk of the request, nearly $8.2 million, would go to the enhanced access fund, with most of the dollars earmarked for technology and security improvements. 
Bonnet said a new chief information officer, who joined the office in 2023, assessed the IT systems and concluded that the “antiquated systems … (were) in danger of failing.” Improving that part of the office has created “a high spending curve” that Bonnet said would fall at the beginning of next year to between $4-5 million. 
In response to another question from Garten about the office’s staffing, which he said had grown from 46 employees when Morales was elected in 2022 to 80 currently, Bonnet pointed to additional office duties related to elections and cybersecurity. 
“We have a lot to do,” he said.
The additional dollars for the securities enforcement fund and the securities restitution fund will be $500,000 and $800,000, respectively. Finally, the appropriation to meet the Help America Vote Act will get $750,000 more dollars.

A group of young men in Jacksonville, Florida, arranged to celebrate Lincoln’s birthday in 1900. My brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, and I decided to write a song to be sung at the exercises. I wrote the words and he wrote the music. Our New York publisher, Edward B. Marks, made mimeographed copies for us, and the song was taught to and sung by a chorus of five hundred colored school children.
Shortly afterwards my brother and I moved away from Jacksonville to New York, and the song passed out of our minds. But the school children of Jacksonville kept singing it; they went off to other schools and sang it; they became teachers and taught it to other children. Within twenty years it was being sung over the South and in some other parts of the country. Today the song, popularly known as the Negro National Hymn, is quite generally used.
The lines of this song repay me in an elation, almost of exquisite anguish, whenever I hear them sung by Negro children.



Lift every voice and sing   
Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the listening skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.   
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.
Stony the road we trod,
Bitter the chastening rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;   
Yet with a steady beat,
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past,   
Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.
God of our weary years,   
God of our silent tears,
Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way;
Thou who hast by Thy might   
Led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,
Lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,   
May we forever stand.   
True to our God,
True to our native land.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1465399086-e1687179516359.jpg,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

Picnics. Family  outings. Special jazz concerts sponsored by Black sororities and social clubs.
In those days, Juneteenth was an intra-communal gathering, shared between us like secret knowledge, because we knew the story behind the tradition. In June, 1865, two years after the Emancipation proclamation,and months following the Confederate surrender in the Civil War, Union General Gordon Granger  finally reached a group of slaves in Galveston, Texas, These enslaved people did not know that the South had lost the Civil War. General Granger informed them they were free. The enlightened former slaves threw a joyous celebration, which became alternately known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day or (today) Juneteenth.
It was originally celebrated every June 19th in Texas. Its popularity spread throughout Black communities in the 1930s when it represented the aspirations of Black Americans who knew they were liberated from slavery, yet lacked full equality. The 4th  of July represented independence, in the sense of breaking from England, while Juneteenth symbolized freedom in both a legalistic and spiritual sense — freedom from slavery before the next step toward full humanity.
In 2023, I was the main speaker at the annual Juneteenth event sponsored by the City of Santa Fe, NM, at which the Mayor Alan Webber officially proclaimed Juneteenth Day locally. I reiterated the classic script, describing Juneteenth’s origin, but I also used to the occasion to discuss how New Mexico still  had a way to go achieving freedom from hunger and child poverty, or the malaise of substance abuse. This is the narrative that Juneteenth bequeaths to the country, since becoming a national event: Celebrate social and economic justice, and believe someday it is coming!
There is no doubt in my mind that this country needs a federal holiday like this one, encouraging the populace to address perceived forms of oppression, with belief that they can survive the travails and, in the end, achieve redemption and renewal. Freedom is both specific, to a particular set of circumstances, and universal, which is why Juneteenth eventually spoke to the hearts and minds of all Americans. Yet this year — in 2025— the spirit of the holiday almost contradicts President Trump’s regressive national policy.
The holiday arrives at a time when President Trump is waging an unprecedented war on civil rights, first amendment rights, free speech rights, academic freedom, or the freedom to protest. The administration uses executive order to force government grantees to desist engaging in speech the administration dislikes, including anything that honors diversity, equity or inclusion; seriously addresses climate change; or highlights the LGBTQ community.
It arrives at a time when Trump’s ICE agents engage in massive raids that terrorize Latino communities, indiscriminately ordering civilians inside unmarked vans  and “disappearing” immigrants who have positively contributed to  American society. Following protests that erupted against ICE raids in Los Angeles, California Gov. Gavin Newsom accurately critiqued Trump’s immigration policy, asserting that Trump’s methods do more harm than good because, “Instead of focusing on undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records and people with final deportation orders — a strategy both parties have long supported — this administration is pushing mass deportations. Indiscriminately targeting hardworking immigrant families, regardless of their roots or risk. What’s happening right now is very different than anything we’ve seen before.”
With increasing authoritarianism, without consulting California government officials, Trump deployed National Guardsmen and marines to Los Angeles using tear gas and rubber bullets. This move against the populace (which Gov. Newsom called “ a reckless deployment of American troops to a major American city”) is among the many ways that the administration discourages citizens from engaging in legal protest or enjoying free speech.
This year, we will celebrate freedom from chattel slavery. We will celebrate a victory for humanity. But the celebration is shadowed by an awareness that bondage can take other forms. It is fear of being arrested, economically disenfranchised or “disappeared.” Fear that the country is inching towards totalitarianism is against the spirit of  Juneteenth.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Darryl-1024x461.jpeg,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The Tennessee House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

(Photo via Environment Florida)I’m visiting family in Pensacola this week, and I noticed that the local news has been focused on feces.
I don’t mean they’re cracking lots of poop jokes like SpongeBob SquarePants (“Oh, POOP, you never let us down.”) I mean they’ve been doing Very Serious Stories on how persistent sewage leaks are driving people in one high-end subdivision absolutely bonkers.
“Residents in a neighborhood off Scenic Highway estimate nearly a million gallons of sewage has been leaked into the Escambia Bay,” WEAR-TV reported recently. “Neighbors say this has happened more than half a dozen times in recent years.”
Pensacola is not the only Florida city whose name starts with a P that’s suffering from poopy water. In Palm Bay, over on the state’s east coast, a sewage line burst and spilled more than 3 million gallons of sewage into the bay.
These Florida sewer problems are popping (not pooping!) up more and more these days. Some smart folks have been warning us about it for years. Have we paid attention to the warnings? No, we have not, despite the dire impact these leaks have on our famous beaches.

An environmental organization called the Surfrider Foundation has been banging the drum like Buddy Rich to get our politicians to pay attention to our sewer problems. I called up Katie Bauman of Surfrider’s Florida office this week to ask if there had been any progress. No, she said.
“It continues to be a major problem in this state,” she told me.
Then she pointed out that both our fine Legislature and our current president seem to be working hard to make things much, much worse for us.
That’s not the kind of news that makes you feel flush with pride.
 Everyone poops
There’s a popular children’s book called “Everyone Poops.”  So far, no Florida school board has banned it from their library the way they have “And Tango Makes Three.”
That’s a good thing, because the book is telling the truth. Poop is a common human product, no matter what your wealth, class, or employment status may be.
If you don’t believe me, I refer you to a recent New York Times story about the South Florida island known as the “Billionaire’s Bunker,” where the likes of Jeff Bezos, Tom Brady, and Ivanka Trump have been wrangling with the nearby town of Surfside over their sewage disposal.
“In a place where many of the estates have more than 10 toilets, nobody has quite figured out how to dispose of what comes out of them,” the Times reported.
In Florida, the disposal choices are limited to septic tanks and sewer lines. Septic tanks tend to fail and leak into our waterways, fueling toxic algae blooms. That’s why people concerned about the future are trying to get as many folks as possible to stop using them and hook up to sewer lines.
But a lot of our sewer lines and sewer plants are so old they make the dinosaurs from Dinosaur World look like spring chickens, which means they’re prone to break.

“At the advent of the Clean Water Act, a lot of cities made use of the federal funding to build new sewer plants,” said Justin Bloom of Suncoast Waterkeeper, another environmental organization that’s been pushing for better sewage treatment.
Some cities and counties have done a good job of maintaining their sewer plants over the decades since the 1970s, he said, naming Sarasota County as one example
Some have not, he said, naming Bradenton. That selection was not a surprise since Bloom’s organization sued Bradenton in 2022 for releasing too much pollution into the Manatee River.
 The big spill
The high-water mark (so to speak) for Florida’s sewer crisis news came after Fort Lauderdale produced the worst sewage spill in Florida history in 2020.
More than 126 million gallons of sewage gushed into streets, yards, and waterways. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel noted that amount was “enough to fill 192 Olympic-sized pools,” which is not the kind of pleasing mental image that Florida tourism promoters prefer.
The big spill opened the floodgates for lots of news stories that followed.
“Florida has recently experienced several large sewage spills,” the British paper The Guardian reported, “and the issue is expected to worsen in the state due to its growing population, urban development, the climate crisis and aging infrastructure that frequently cause existing wastewater systems to fail.”
“Data from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection show the number of sewage spills in the state has risen steadily over the past decade,” WUFT-FM reported.
Meanwhile, WLRN-FM found that the Fort Lauderdale spill was “a sign of infrastructure woes for other coastal cities.” The station amplified that message by adding this historical note:
“In the last five years, conditions have gotten so bad in South Florida that environmental regulators put three local governments under legal mandates — telling them how to fix the problems. Dozens of others have been cited by” the DEP.
That’s alarming news for a state that depends on clean water for both its seafood and tourism industries to thrive.
The newspaper Florida Today created a website that tracks all the sewage spills reported in Florida. I checked it this week. It showed so many dots for recent and ongoing spills that it looks like a dartboard that’s been hanging in an Irish pub since St. Patrick vanquished the snakes.
 Sewers ain’t sexy
In addition to age, another major problem for all of Florida’s sewer plants is volume.
Because of Florida’s rampant, unchecked growth, a lot of the sewer systems are now handling (so to speak) a lot more wastewater than they were designed to handle.
We now have 23 million residents and more than 100 million annual visitors flushing toilets all over the state. As WLRN pointed out, it’s like the frequent traffic gridlock on our streets has been transferred to our sewer lines. In both cases, too much traffic leads to backups. Of course, one smells far worse than the other.
Then there is the complication of — shhh! don’t let the Legislature hear us talking about this! — climate change.
Not only are we seeing rising sea levels but our warming world is producing lots more precipitation for our stormwater drains to funnel into the sewers. Our rising sea level is pushing the underground aquifer level higher too, the Miami Herald recently reported.
“When tides rise, so too does that water underneath our streets and buildings — an effect that can extend far inland,” the newspaper noted. “Already, those higher groundwater levels have been linked with more intense floods, like those that have swamped homes and streets in Fort Lauderdale, Aventura or Hialeah in the last few years.”
Then one of our increasingly intense hurricanes, fueled by warmer Gulf waters, crashes ashore. That’s how we wind up with a lot of putrid water standing in everyone’s house and street. But it doesn’t take a hurricane to crash our sewer systems these days. Those are just the most dramatic breakdowns.
When increased flooding backs up an antiquated sewer system and breaks it, there’s a flurry of news coverage, but soon that goes away. Even the news coverage of the Michigan sewage lift station named for Florida Pulitzer-winner Dave Barry died down after a while.
Reporters and politicians go chasing after other subjects, and the sewer problem remains unresolved.
“It’s just not that sexy to work on sewage issues,” Bloom said.
But it sure should be, since it affects whether we can use our all-important beaches, a major attraction for tourists.

 Testing the waters
One of the most important things that the Surfrider Foundation does in Florida is test the waters.
No, the Surfrider volunteers are not running around dipping their toes into the waves to check the temperature. They’re testing for fecal material that could make swimmers sick.
The Florida Department of Health runs a Healthy Beaches program that’s supposed to test all the waterways for contamination (more on that in a moment). An environmental group called Environment America compiled the state tests and found that, in 2022, 70% of Florida’s beaches tested positive for fecal contamination.
I’m terrible at math, but even I can see that’s a lot of beaches closed for contamination.
“People read that and think, ‘That’s not the place we should vacation this year,’” Bauman said.
Because the Health Department folks can’t cover every beach in Florida, Surfrider steps in to do testing by volunteers and post the results, Bauman told me. The effort is worthwhile because it can spare beachgoers from contracting a virus from the pollution.
“The public needs to know about this when they’re going for a swim,” she said.
Those Surfrider volunteers are needed more and more these days.
Before 2011, Bauman told me, the state and the feds worked together to pay for the Health Department’s water tests, putting up a total of $1 million a year.
But when Rick “I Live at the Beach But I Don’t Swim There” Scott was governor, the state quit putting up its half. Scott slashed every Florida environmental agency to the bone and even tried to sell off some of our parkland, so his hostility to testing for pollution should be no surprise.
The loss of the state funding left only $500,000 from the federal program to cover the cost. That led to “cuts to where and when the testing occurred,” she said.
It went from weekly to bi-weekly, Bauman said, and major stretches of the state’s coastline went completely untested.
“We’ve advocated for restoring the funding,” she said, “but once it’s cut out of the budget, it’s hard to get it back in again.”
Given that we now have the most anti-environment president in history back in the White House, you can probably guess what comes next.
The president’s proposed budget, Bauman said, calls for eliminating the federal half of the money for testing the waters.
If you’re scoring this at home, that takes the funding for beach testing in Florida from $1 million in 2010 to half that after 2011 to nothing starting this year. Zero. Zip. Nada.
If this budget passes Congress, I think the only tourists who’d want to visit a Florida beach would be the weirdos who cosplay as the Ty-D-Bowl Man.
 The poop on how to fix this
I don’t want you to think all of Florida’s politicians are insane in the membrane when it comes to Florida’s escalating sewer crisis.
Just last year, the Legislature voted to pass a bill called the Safe Waterways Act. The bill was designed to create a statewide system under the Department of Health to send warnings and issue beach, canal, and pool closures within 24 hours of the discovery of dangerous pollution problems.
The goal of the bill was to create a streamlined system for reporting contaminated waterways and swimming spots. Isn’t that great? You can see why it was so popular that every single legislator voted for it, no matter what their party label.
But then it landed on the desk of the one governor in Florida history who seems to really detest clean water. Maybe he’s just looking for any excuse to wear his white go-go boots again.
With or without his boots, Ron DeSantis always seems eager to bigfoot local government. But he vetoed this bill because, he said, it gave a state agency the power over decisions about closing beaches that should be left entirely up to counties and cities. Given his loud objections to things that smell bad, I was surprised at the veto.
Sponsors refiled the bill this year, but this time around they couldn’t get any traction.
I suspect this common-sense measure ran into a roadblock because some folks didn’t want all the bad publicity from having so many beaches being closed at once. Picture the mayor from “Jaws” hurrying to reopen the beach at Amity Island before any more scared vacationers leave.
I have a possible solution for this problem of politicians not taking our sewer crisis seriously. I think we should learn from what happened to Dave Barry and rename our clanking, clattering old sewer plants for the poopyheads who have been ignoring the danger here.
Then, when the plant breaks, I picture the local TV news reporting: “The fecal material that’s stinking up the neighborhood is coming from the Ron DeSantis Wastewater Plant.” Or how about: “Millions of gallons of raw sewage have been seen spewing from the Donald J. Trump Wastewater Plant, which officials said was very old.”
I bet that would get their attention and they would hurry to fix the problem. If this works, then we can all join with SpongeBob and say, “Oh, poop, you never let us down!”

Locals opened the market as a cooperative in 2022 after the tiny town lost its only grocery store (Kevin Hardy/Stateline).If you live in a small town, you probably have fewer grocery stores than you did 30 years ago — and fewer choices inside them.
Independent grocers have disappeared, replaced by big national chains that now decide what’s on the shelves, how much it costs, and who gets to profit.
In 1990, the top four grocery chains controlled just 13% of nationwide sales. By 2019, the top four retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Costco, and Ahold Delhaize — controlled 34% of U.S. grocery sales, according to the USDA.
That concentration hasn’t gone unnoticed. Just last year, the Federal Trade Commission and nine states sued to block a $25 billion merger between grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons, arguing that the deal would harm both shoppers and workers by reducing competition, increasing prices, and consolidating power into fewer hands. The merger has since unraveled, but only after a court battle and mounting public pressure.

In rural counties, market concentration more than doubled between 1990 and 2019, according to USDA data.
One way to measure concentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a tool used to track monopoly risk. In rural areas, HHI scores jumped from 3,104 to 5,584 — more than twice the threshold where federal antitrust regulators start to worry about competition. According to a 2023 USDA report, the USDA considers anything above 2,500 is considered highly concentrated.
Now that trend may speed up. The White House has proposed nearly $7 billion in USDA budget cuts, including $721 million from Rural Development programs — the ones that help small towns open grocery stores and other local businesses. One program on the chopping block is the Rural Business-Cooperative Service. Loan funding for community facilities and rural businesses would also drop by 45%, with no new grant dollars offered.
At the same time, the administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” initiative discusses improving nutrition, but proposes cuts to the very programs that help people buy food, including Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), school meal equipment, and farm-to-school efforts.
The bottom line? Rural communities already hit hardest by grocery consolidation are now facing even more roadblocks.

Mississippi lawmakers have long resisted reforming the state’s dysfunctional public defense system, which can often leave an indigent defendant in jail for weeks or months without access to a lawyer, a long-held Constitutional right.
Gov. Tate Reeves has until June 19 to sign the funding bill, allow it to become law without signing, or veto it. The bill provides $668,000 for the Office of State Public Defender to set up the one-year test run.

State Public Defender André de Gruy said if the bill becomes law, the money will be used to hire three or four attorneys and support staff working in the seven counties of the state’s 5th Circuit Court District, located in north-central Mississippi. Those new attorneys would work alongside lawyers already handling public defense in the district. He hopes the pilot program will be renewed next year and ultimately run for three years. The new state money would come in addition to what the counties in that court district are already spending on public defense.
A key goal will be to represent indigent felony clients beginning the day they are first charged, de Gruy said. That’s an area where public defense in Mississippi has long failed to meet national standards. 
“The practice of early representation really doesn’t happen anywhere in Mississippi,” de Gruy said, speaking of defendants with court-appointed counsel. 
At only a year’s worth of money, it’s a small step but still marks the most meaningful move from the Legislature in years to improve the state’s patchwork public defense system. If the bill becomes law, it will be the first time any state money has gone toward non-death-penalty cases in local trial courts outside Hinds County.
During state Senate debate, Sen. Brice Wiggins, a Gulf Coast-area Republican who shepherded the funding bill, described the pilot program as a “way for us to start looking at a statewide public defender system.”
In Mississippi, public defense is largely left to a sprawling network of local courts and governments with no state resources or funding. There is also no monitoring or oversight of how local systems perform. A defendant facing felony charges can move through as many as three different courts, sometimes changing lawyers along the way or even going without a lawyer for key stretches of time.
The Office of State Public Defender, which de Gruy was appointed by the governor to lead, handles death penalty cases and appeals by indigent defendants following their original trials. The office also receives some money to help supplement the Hinds County Public Defender’s Office’s funding.
Otherwise, de Gruy’s office plays no role in representing local felony defendants.
Experts have estimated that as many as 80% of the state’s felony defendants are indigent. The percentage is likely higher in counties with high poverty rates. 
“Mississippi has had the same problems for the 30 years I’ve been working on it,” said David Carroll, the founder and president of the Sixth Amendment Center, a Boston-based nonprofit think tank that focuses on the improvement of public defense across the country.
With only one year of funding for just one of the state’s 23 circuit court districts, it’s unclear whether the bill will chart the way toward statewide improvements.
Even as he’s “cheering this on,” Carroll said stronger commitments from the state are needed to turn a short-term program into a lasting reform effort. 
He said effective systems can be built in a piecemeal fashion. He pointed to Kentucky and Georgia, which used incremental, county-by-county approaches to produce statewide changes.
The funding bill also comes amid increasing scrutiny of the state’s so-called “dead zone” — the time between the first appearance before a judge and an indictment by a grand jury, which can take months.
After their first appearance in court, indigent defendants were often unrepresented before indictment, even when jailed. Almost two years ago, the Mississippi Supreme Court banned this practice, at least on paper.
The high court ordered the lower courts to continuously provide a poor defendant with a lawyer.
However, the decentralized nature of public defense in Mississippi means that it’s been hard to determine whether the new rule is being followed.
Reporting by The Marshall Project, ProPublica and the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal found that many courts did not initially have any plan about how to follow the new rule. After the news reports, a former state Supreme Court justice said much the same to a state House of Representatives committee in 2023.
The human toll can be significant. The Marshall Project previously reported that one man spent about a year and a half in jail on a drug charge with no lawyer before a judge assigned him an attorney and ordered him released. In another county, a local judge forced a woman to represent herself during a key court hearing even after she asked for appointed counsel. She ultimately testified on her behalf without an attorney’s assistance.
Solving this “day 1” problem will be a key goal for the pilot program, said de Gruy, the state public defender.
He’s been in talks for months with local officials of the state’s 5th Circuit Court District, including judges, law enforcement figures, and city and county officials. The counties in the 5th district are Attala, Carroll, Choctaw, Grenada, Montgomery, Webster and Winston. Several of these counties have high poverty rates, such as Winston, where U.S. Census data showed nearly 30% of residents living in poverty in 2023. The statewide poverty rate in 2023 was 18%.
Early representation can lead to a quicker resolution of a case, the preservation of evidence, identification of defendants who require mental health intervention, and lower costs for county jails, de Gruy said.
Wiggins, the senator, told lawmakers that an improved and effective public defense system “actually makes our courts run better.”
The proposed funding faced stiff questioning in the Senate, including from several senators who have been paid by counties to provide public defense work. Debate on the measure came during a chaotic two-day special session to pass a budget, and some lawmakers complained that they didn’t know enough about the pilot program de Gruy would oversee. 
The funding for the rural public defender program might very well have been pulled had it not been attached to a larger bill brought up on a do-or-die vote. The Senate last year killed a bill that would have authorized the state public defender to establish statewide public defense standards for local officials to follow. 
In designing the proposed pilot program, the Office of State Public Defense has partnered with the Deason Criminal Justice Reform Center, a research center housed at Southern Methodist University Law School in Texas. If the program funding is approved, Deason will also be involved in the operation and evaluation of the program.

(Photo by 4nadia/iStock / Getty Images Plus)Public transit will no longer enjoy a free ride across two Washington bridges this fall.
Starting Oct. 1, operators of public and private bus services must pay tolls on the State Route 520 floating bridge and the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Vanpool and public rideshare services, most of which are offered by transit agencies, too.
They all enjoy an exemption now. But this past session, as state lawmakers looked for ways to fill a billion-dollar hole in the transportation budget, they directed the Washington State Commission to erase the carveouts.
The repeal is in the six-year, $3.2 billion revenue package passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson. The marquee item — a 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax — is counted on to produce nearly half the money. Ditching the toll exemption is projected to raise roughly $1 million a year.
“We were disappointed that the state Legislature felt this policy was needed to fund the gap on the backs of public transit users and providers,” said Justin Leighton, executive director of the Washington State Transit Association.
All publicly or privately owned or operated transit buses, vans, and rideshare vehicles will pay bridge tolls when the exemption goes away. School buses will continue to be exempt. 
King County Metro runs buses across the State Route 520 floating bridge and Pierce Transit over the Tacoma Narrows span.
The rules will also be in force when tolling begins on the Interstate 5 bridge across the Columbia River as part of the project to replace the span linking Oregon and Washington. Tolling on that bridge is projected to begin in 2027.
This will be the first time transit providers pay to traverse the floating bridge.
King County Metro is assessing the cost. The toll will depend on the type of vehicle and the time of day it crosses Lake Washington. 
Based on current service levels, there are 118,000 buses, and 100,000 vanpool, Access paratransit and Community Access Transit vehicles that travel across the floating bridge annually, said spokesman Jeff Switzer.
On the Narrows Bridge, it’s a return to a prior practice. Pierce Transit had paid tolls on that span until 2019, when it secured an exemption from the Washington State Transportation Commission.
Though disappointed, Pierce Transit recognizes that it was “a necessary tradeoff to ensure transit funding remained largely intact and kept most transit projects on track,” Communications Director Rebecca Japhet said.
Pierce Transit will shell out approximately $61,380 a year in bus tolls, she said. There will be added expenses for its Rideshare program. The toll would likely be incorporated into the rideshare fee for groups that use the Narrows Bridge at a future rate change, she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/tacoma-narrows-bridge-1024x541.jpg,,,2025-06-19 08:01:53.722703

The town settled after lawsuits filed by the solar developer stalled the Bennington High School project, a large-scale public-private partnership to bring housing and community resources to Bennington.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bennington settles with solar developer, sparking community uproar.","After 12 years of legal disputes, the town of Bennington agreed to support two controversial solar projects before the state, following lawsuits from the developer that jeopardized a major local revitalization effort. 
Plans for two adjacent solar projects on a forested, 27-acre plot between the Apple Hill residential area and highway have garnered pushback from residents over the years. The main concerns have been that the project locations are in violation of town plan and zoning rules and could negatively affect the scenic hillside and neighboring community.
The proposed Apple Hill and Chelsea solar fields — each designed to produce 2 megawatts of power — have gone through multiple iterations but were repeatedly denied by the state’s Public Utilities Commission. 
But solar developer and lawyer Thomas Melone has continually appealed the commission’s decision to dismiss his plans to the courts, though the Vermont Supreme Court struck down his appeals in the past, sending the decision back to the commission in 2019. There are four administrative agency appeals regarding the applications for Apple Hill Solar LLC and Chelsea Solar LLC pending in Vermont Supreme Court.
Thomas and his son, Michael Melone, have also filed lawsuits against state regulators, Bennington residents, the town of Bennington and the Apple Hill Homeowners Association. Even Gov. Phil Scott has been caught in the legal crossfire, according to Vermont Public.
Annette Smith, executive director of Vermonters for a Clean Environment, said she views the amount of litigation initiated by the solar developers as unusual and unprecedented in the history of Vermont utilities cases.
Bennington resident Dianna Leazer said at a June 9 Select Board meeting that locals and the town had “successfully defended our beautiful small town from a corporate solar developer who would scar our hillside with a huge commercial size solar development.” Leazer said residents “deserved to know all the factors that led to this decision” to ratify the agreement.

What’s in the agreement?
In a special Select Board meeting on June 3, the board voted 5-1 to ratify the settlement, agreeing to direct the town’s planning commission to consider rezoning the land as rural residential instead of rural conservation. 
“There were a number of factors and risks in either accepting the agreement or rejecting it,” Select Board Chair Tom Haley said at the June 9 meeting. “We want to make clear that after consultation and in consideration of the town’s goals and needs, the Select Board approved the settlement agreement.”
According to the settlement, the town agreed the two projects are in a “preferred area,” are not prominently visible on a hillside, do not violate the town plan or town documents and do not have “adverse regional impact.” The town agreed to support the Melones’ various iterations of Apple Hill and Chelsea solar projects under consideration by the Public Utilities Commission and the Vermont Supreme Court, as long as the projects maintain the same footprint or less.
“The town, having had an opportunity to fully review and assess the solar projects, agrees that it is not under any duress (economic or otherwise) and stipulates and agrees that the projects are in a ‘preferred area,’” the settlement stated.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Melones agreed to drop six lawsuits against the town, including an Open Meeting Law complaint and appeals regarding the Bennington High School redevelopment project —  a yearslong plan to transform the vacant building into affordable housing, office spaces and a hub for child care and community resources under a private-public partnership.
The father-son duo also agreed not to file or threaten any lawsuit regarding the redevelopment project or the “validity of the Town Plan” against Bennington. 
The town supported different versions of the solar development plans in 2018 after making changes based on public input in which the Melones agreed to drop the legal challenge to the town’s energy plan, damage claims and allegations of constitutional rights violations. But, the Public Utilities Commission rejected those versions of projects.

‘Critical juncture’
Lawsuits the Melones filed against the town regarding the Bennington High project placed pressure on the town to support the solar projects, according to court documents filed by the town’s attorney and local officials. 
In a now-dropped lawsuit, Thomas Melone under PLH Vineyard Sky LLC, challenged the town’s support for the Bennington High School redevelopment, calling it a “municipal waste” due to an alleged lack of site remediation and the funding structure of the project.
The complaint, filed May 2 in the Superior Court, also argued the town’s 10-year tax stabilization agreement for the $54 million project violated the Vermont Constitution’s proportional taxation clause by shifting the tax burden to residents. 
In a May 26 affidavit, project developer Zak Hale said a lead bank investor who was set to provide $15 million was spooked by the pending lawsuit and paused funding on May 21. According to Hale, the lawsuit came at a “critical juncture,” jeopardizing construction just after it began on May 20. Hale wrote that the project could collapse, putting him at risk of bankruptcy and the town at risk of losing $1.5 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds. 
Assistant Town Manager Dan Monks wrote in a separate affidavit that Melone had filed repeated lawsuits to pressure Bennington into supporting his solar projects, most of which courts have found baseless. Monks said Melone indicated he would withdraw the complaint if the town backed his plans and the “meritless complaint” threatened the future of the project unless it was resolved. 
On May 20, town attorney Merrill Bent filed an emergency motion to stay discovery in the civil case before the Vermont Superior Court, asserting that the lawsuits challenging the Bennington High School redevelopment was part of a “spate of litigation against the town” to gain state approval of the solar projects.
This litigation waged against the town included seven state court and three federal court actions and “meritless accusations” against the town’s counsel and town officials, Bent wrote. According to the motion filed by Bent, the Melones also engaged in “ongoing, repeat threats to bury the town in lawsuits” under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and the False Claims Act.
“The Plaintiff, along with its counsel, Thomas Melone, continue to weaponize the courts against the Town of Bennington in their singularly focused effort to force the Town to support their solar projects,” Bent wrote.

The community’s response
At the June 9 meeting, Leazer expressed disbelief after learning Bennington settled with the Melones, saying it’s apparent that “the Benn High redevelopment project was the major catalyst to ratification.”
“Essentially, if not ratified, the solar developer would continue to sue the town and delay the Benn High redevelopment project indefinitely, because the solar developer can, because their pockets are deep and they are attorneys,” Leazer said. 
Leazer also expressed concern that the Melones could sue the town again if the agreement is nullified. Under the terms of the settlement, the agreement would be void and both parties could sue again if funding for the Bennington High project falls through and the project is not completed by year’s end.
Smith said the Melones can also sue the town again if the town does not begin the process of reclassifying the parcel as rural residential within 10 days of ratification under the terms of the agreement. The Select Board has referred the discussion to the town’s planning commission, which plans to meet June 18.

Peter Lawrence, a retired attorney and Apple Hill resident, raised concerns at the June 9 meeting about how the settlement was ratified. He said the meeting violated Vermont’s Open Meeting Law by not disclosing the agreement to the public before ratification and not allowing the public to offer comment at the meeting.
Lawrence urged the Select Board to rescind its decision and hold another meeting “at which the public can be fully informed of all the details of the matter being considered and there be opportunity for public comment.” 
But Monks said at the June 3 meeting that settlements deliberated in executive sessions are exempt from the law and are required to be negotiated outside of the public, so agreement could not be disclosed unless it was approved. Board member Ed Woods added that the meeting agenda was only warned for the ratification vote, not for public comment, so the board could not open the meeting for public discussion.
Thomas Melone said he’s pleased the disputes with the town have been resolved.
“My view is that the open meeting law was satisfied,” he wrote in a statement to VTDigger. “The Select Board took the vote in a public meeting and my view is that with respect to litigation that is all that is required under section 313 (of the Vermont statute).”
Bill Knight, Bennington resident and president of the Apple Hill Homeowners Association, said at the June 9 meeting that the two solar farms will be an eyesore for the town, as the elevation of the plot would make development visible from tourist attractions such as the Bennington Battle monument, the Mount Anthony Country Club and Welcome Center.
Thomas Melone said the last time the Public Utilities Commission denied the petition for a Certificate of Public Good, it was due to the project fence’s partial visibility during off-leaf seasons. “That is no longer the case,” he wrote in an email. He added that concerns that the projects will be visible from the Welcome Center are “simply counterfactual.”
State Rep. Mary Morrissey, R-Bennington, said she was concerned the agreement did not stipulate the plans the solar developers could implement. She said the area is contaminated with PFOA, also known as perfluorooctanoic acid, and that previous iterations of the solar development plan included blasting the ledge of the area which would further spread PFOA into the air. 
The Bennington region has the most severe PFAS contamination problem in the state, and PFOA groundwater and soil contamination has spread and increased over time in the area, according to research published this year. 
Melone said he thinks the PFOA issues were addressed in testimony submitted to the Public Utilities Commission in 2018 by a senior hydrologist, who studied the groundwater and soil and concluded that the projects were unlikely to cause PFOA levels to rise in Apple Hill’s residential drinking water wells. 
A Public Utilities Commission final order in September 2018 recommended the commission find no evidence that the projects would exacerbate PFOA groundwater contamination, but denied the Certificate of Public Good. 
Smith said the commission is tasked with making the final decisions regarding the solar projects. After years of rejections by the commission and the Vermont Supreme Court, Smith said the efforts of the developer to gain town support “does not mean that the projects will ultimately be approved.”
Resident Lora Block expressed concern that the Bennington Select Board and Planning Commission may reclassify the site and that the Public Utilities Commission could reverse its stance to support the projects if the zoning is changed. 
“The town has certain aesthetic standards, and this sort of development will be visible from everywhere, from the highway and from the Bennington monument and from the beautiful golf course,” Block said. “The reason why we’re trying to prevent these solar farms is not because we’re against solar, but because the siting of these are against our town plan.”

Once a single-day celebration, Lansing’s Juneteenth festivities have expanded into a weekend-long event. The itinerary features a variety of activities, including the Freedom Festival Family Night, the African American Parade, and the flag ceremony at Lansing City Hall.
State Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) delivered the keynote address at Wednesday’s ceremony, which was held at Lansing Community College. 
Anthony explained that Juneteenth marks a moment in history that shaped the present while calling for the present to shape history in return.

The message of Juneteenth– resilience, joy, and liberation– remains as relevant in 2025 as it was in 1865, she said.
“So what does Juneteenth call upon us to do in a moment like this, in a moment in which they are trying to rob us of our history, rob us of our social and civil rights?” Anthony asked. “It calls upon us to remember not just the facts, but the feelings—our feelings of heartbreak and of hope. It calls us to teach our children the story of America in its entirety, the good and the bad.”
“Juneteenth isn’t just about looking back,” Anthony added. “It’s also about asking ourselves, what are we going to do today to make freedom real for everyone in Michigan?”
State Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D–Lansing) presented the Juneteenth Committee with a commendation signed by leaders from across the state, including State Reps. Kara Hope, Julie Brixie, Penelope Tsernoglou, Angela Witwer, and Amos O’Neal; State Sens. Sam Singh and Sarah Anthony; Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist; and Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who also issued a proclamation declaring June 19, 2025 as Juneteenth Celebration Day.
For many, the formal recognition underscored just how far the holiday has come.
“When I was in school, we did not learn about Juneteenth,” said Robin Smith, who emceed the event. “When I learned about Juneteenth, it was in my home and from my family; it was oral history that was passed down. The honor of having it written and being recognized gives it gravity and weight. Honor is being poured out in the words that are on those documents, and it matters.”
The kick-off event also honored the Juneteenth Essay Contest and Scholarship Program winners. The program, which seeks to educate local youth on the historical significance of Juneteenth, offers prizes and scholarships to students in grades 6-12 in the greater Lansing area. The 2025 awardees– Evie Gruen, Khadija Ujendo, Angel Redmond, Langston Chambers, and Zeinabu Ujendo– were recognized for their essays on the history and importance of Juneteenth.
Additionally, the Juneteenth Committee announced plans for a new scholarship program: The Dr. Wille D. Davis Jr. and Bonnie A. Jones Lansing Juneteenth Social Justice Scholarship. Starting in 2026, the $1,000 scholarship will be awarded to a Lansing area high school senior planning to attend a four-year college, university, or trade program.

(Aerial photography by Ed Saunders)Imagine your town has one car mechanic, and the mechanic just doubled the price for an oil change even though the mechanic’s costs have stayed the same. You have no choice but to use that mechanic, and you have to swallow the cost, even as more and more of your paycheck is swallowed by it. 
That’s exactly what NorthWestern Energy, Montana’s monopoly utility, is attempting to accomplish with its most recent rate increase request to the Public Service Commission. It wants to jack up your energy bills so they can pocket what amounts to a 10.8% profit rate – far above the industry’s benchmark 6.28%. In plain terms, it is asking you to foot the bill for its, and its investors’, greed. Even worse, it is asking you to foot the bill for risky, expensive and unreliable projects such as the Yellowstone County Generating Station in Laurel and the expansion of the Colstrip Power Plant. At the same time, NorthWestern lobbied to block affordable community solar to ensure that its monopoly profits are not interfered with.
Cumulatively, Billings customers would lose $8 million to NorthWestern’s proposed rate increases. Across the state, NorthWestern customers would lose about $88 million a year to the rate increases. This is money that unfairly goes to NorthWestern’s out-of-state shareholders instead of staying in our local economy.
What Montanans need now are cost decreases. According to a December 2024 report from Congress’s Joint Economic Committee, Montanans are paying $1,119 more per month to purchase the same basket of goods and services than in January 2021. Montanans have to spend $106 more per month to maintain the same standard of living as in 2023. And, according to a Montana Free Press-Eagleton poll, three in four Montanans were concerned about being able to afford housing in the state during the next five years.
Ratepayers should not absorb the costs of the risky and imprudent investments in the Laurel gas plant and Colstrip Power Plant. For the remaining generation assets, Montanans deserve a reduction – rather than a brazen increase. Lowering NorthWestern’s return on equity to the roughly 6% industry benchmark would save Billings households about $100 a year.
The Public Service Commission has the opportunity to stand up for Montanans by denying NorthWestern’s rate increase proposal. It did so in January when it denied a $42.4 million rate increase proposal from NorthWestern on the grounds that such an increase would not fairly balance the interests of the monopoly’s shareholders with the interests of Montana ratepayers. Importantly, it rejected NorthWestern’s claim that the proposed rate hike was necessary to maintain its financial integrity, attract capital, and compensate investors for the risks it assumed. Rather, the PSC saw through the smoke and mirrors and emphasized that NorthWestern has paid increasing dividends to shareholders every year since 2004.
NorthWestern’s most recent ask is no different than the proposal denied in January. Simply put, NorthWestern is again trying to pass off the costs of bad investments to Montana ratepayers because it is a monopoly selling to captive ratepayers. Instead of investing in innovative technologies to produce cheaper, cleaner energy, it has dug its heels into Colstrip despite researchers predicting it will be uneconomic to run existing coal plants by 2030. The Laurel gas plant, which will cost $320 million to construct and will accrue $2.3 billion in lifetime costs, is the same story.

Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) said at the Tuesday celebration. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Exmainer.)Wisconsin state leaders spent the week leading up to Juneteenth recognizing the holiday and calling for the fight for freedom and equality to continue. 
Juneteenth marks the official end of slavery in the United States on June 19, 1865. On that day, Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, to announce to more than 250,000 enslaved Black people that they were free, about two and a half years after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. 
The Juneteenth flag was raised over the Wisconsin State Capitol on Wednesday afternoon for the sixth year in a row. Gov. Tony Evers spoke at a ceremony held on the observation deck in the rain. The flag will be up over the Capitol until sunset on Thursday. 
The star in the center of the flag is meant to represent Texas — the Lone Star State — as well as a nova to signify a new beginning and freedom for Black Americans, while the red, white and blue colors are meant to represent that enslaved people and their descendants are Americans and shall be forever free.
Evers said the holiday is a time to celebrate the “critical progress” that’s been made and to commit to “make sure our work is building a more just, a more equitable and a freer state and country.”

“Now more than ever, we must not be silent about the realities faced by communities who have felt the disproportionate impacts of centuries of injustice. Now, more than ever, we must work towards the future where every family, no matter their background, race, zip code, or socioeconomic status has the tools and resources required,” Evers said  And now, more than ever as leaders in D.C. try to sow division We must remember that there is more that unites us than divides us and that our diversity is our strength, not our weakness.” 
The legislative Black Caucus hosted a celebration of Juneteenth in the rotunda of the state Capitol on Tuesday and the theme of the celebration was “Voices of Freedom: Justice in Motion, Leading with Purpose.” The caucus also honored La Crosse Mayor Shaundel Washington Spivey and Racine Judge Jamie McClendon, who are both the first black elected leaders to serve in their respected roles.
Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee)  said they were gathered to celebrate “not just Black history but American history.” 
“We honor the legacy of those who fought for our emancipation and those who continued to fight for our civil rights and economic progress,” Drake said. 
Drake noted that the significance of Juneteenth has grown with its recognition as a federal holiday reflecting “a broader acknowledgement and importance of freedom and equality in American history.” 
At the celebration, D’Mario Cockfield, co-chair of the Milwaukee County Youth Council, spoke, quipping that he was sure people were wondering why a teen was giving remarks at the Capitol. 
“If you grew up like I did you probably had a Black mother who told you to stay out of grown folks’ business but — believe me I’ve heard that more times than I can count — but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve learned something very important that when it comes to freedom, justice and equality that this is my business and it’s all of yours as well. It’s a shared responsibility,” Cockfield said. 
Cockfield told the crowd that Juneteenth is about remembering how much Black Americans have struggled and overcome and also remembering to be present, aware and to be the change that those who came before us could only wish to see. He said the work towards justice is the work of every generation. 
“Freedom isn’t given, it’s earned through struggle, through sacrifice and through courage,” Cockfield said. He said it also takes the will to be “in grown folks’ business.”

(Photo courtesy of the African American Library at The Gregory School, Houston Public Library)The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
‘All slaves are free’
Juneteenth – short for June Nineteenth – recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”

	Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted, “Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
‘Second Independence Day’
June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

Legacies of slavery
While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”

National recognition
Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”

Backtracking on gains

	
But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Friction between Democrats and Republicans was on display Wednesday as the Senate passed several bills along party lines that create programs, grants and facilities without state funding attached. 
Republicans argued the bills need to be signed before funding is included in the budget to assure them there won’t be any changes made by Gov. Tony Evers using his partial veto, and Democrats said the funding needed to be included to assure them the bills don’t become unfunded mandates.
The first bill — SB 41 — would instruct the Office of School Safety in the Department of Justice to establish a program that allows public and private schools to apply for grants to improve safety in school buildings and provide security training to school staff. The program would sunset in July 2027 under the GOP bill.
The bill initially had $30 million in funding attached, but Republican lawmakers passed an amendment that removed the funding.
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said, while the Senate debated the bill, that his caucus has “no trust” in Evers and his office and said that is the result of vetoes in the past on bills. 
LeMahieu noted three vetoes from last session as example: the veto in the state budget that extended revenue limit increases for schools for 400 years, one on a bill funding a new literacy program and another on a bill meant to help combat PFAS. 
“It is our commitment to you that we are hoping these bills get bipartisan support — they’re bills that are important for Wisconsin,” LeMahieu said. “And if they get through both the houses and the governor signs them. We intend to fund this through the budget process.”  
LeMahieu said that otherwise lawmakers would be funding a program without knowing what it will look like.
“Frankly, there is a trust issue between our caucus and Evers,” LeMahieu said. 
Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said in a statement to the Examiner after the floor session that the GOP-led Legislature has “spent years undermining our constitutional checks and balances by giving themselves outsized influence and control over the policymaking process.” 
“It’s ‘my way or the highway’ for Republicans, who’d rather go as far as passing a Frankenstein budget in pieces than try to work together to get good things done for the people of our state,” Cudaback said. “If Republican lawmakers spent more time working across the aisle in good faith than they do trying to exhaust every avenue to preserve their political power while they still have it, Wisconsinites would be better off.”
Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) said during floor debate that Democrats cannot trust the funding will actually come if the bills are done in that way.
“We’re supposed to trust that bills are going to get passed with no funding because they are going to get funded later,” Smith said, adding that “when there is no funding behind the bill it’s hollow. It means nothing.”
Smith authored an amendment that would have put the funding back. Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) — the author of the bill — voted in favor of every amendment to the bill, including the ones authored by Democrats to provide the funding and in favor of the amendment that he authored that removed the funding from the bill. He made similar votes on other bills that he authored. 
Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) said he has asked Republican lawmakers, including those on the budget committee, about funding for several proposals, but has never gotten a clear answer on funding. 
“Come back and talk to us when you’ve decided. Is it $ 5 [million]? Is it 10 [million]? Is it nothing? Are we actually doing this? If you were bringing this up later with the budget, if we actually had a budget, if we weren’t just waiting for you all to decide whether you’re going to cut the UW budget, if we had a budget in front of us… maybe we could talk,” Spreitzer said. “We have absolutely no idea what you’re doing on the budget. We have no idea if you actually have 17 votes on a budget.” 
With the budget still in process, Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) and Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) have expressed reluctance to support  the budget proposal as approved so far by the Joint Finance Committee. This could leave Senate Republicans — who hold an 18-15 majority — without much wiggle room to pass a budget.
That could give Democrats more leverage. Hesselbein said she is hopeful she can work with Republicans to pass a budget that invests in priorities including public education, higher ed and child care.
“It certainly seems that Sen. Kapenga has been very clear,” Hesselbein said. As for whether Democrats will vote for it, she said, they will “have to see what that budget looks like” but her “door remains open to have those conversations.”
The Senate floor session came after Evers had been urging lawmakers to make sure their bills include funding. 
Evers’ legislative affairs director Zach Madden sent letters to Republican authors of bills last week, which Democrats read during the floor session, expressing Evers’ concern about the lack of funding attached. His office identified 16 bills needing funding.
“While the Governor is supportive of the policy concept the bill aims to accomplish, the bill does not include the necessary funding to implement the bill. Without providing the necessary funding, the legislation is effectively nothing more than an empty promise,” Madden wrote. 
Madden wrote that Evers is requesting the bill be amended to include the funding, the bill be incorporated into the budget bill or that language be added to the bills to “make clear the requirement of the bill is only mandated after adequate funding is appropriated in subsequent legislation specifically for the purpose of the bill.” 
“The Legislature has increasingly tried to pass legislation to create new and unfunded mandates, add additional requirements or policies that require resources to implement, and tie up hundreds of millions of dollars in critical investments in a trust fund or the JFC supplemental fund that never leave Madison to serve the purposes for which they were intended,” Madden wrote. “Due to the Legislature’s inaction, districts still haven’t seen one cent of that funding even as the various policy requirements went into effect.” 
Madden said that lawmakers splitting the bills in the budget from their funding is  “unsustainable and untenable,” and is interfering with the Evers’ ability to exercise his partial veto power. He said the change needs to be made if the bills are going to be signed into law. 
“It is clear the overarching goal of these practices is designed to prevent the Governor from exercising his constitutional veto authority, and it is further apparent the Legislature is now attempting to use this practice to effectively try to pass a biennial budget in pieces.” 
Wanggaard called the letters “intimidating” and “threatening” at one point. 
“That was the intimidating letter that was sent,” Spreitzer said, after reading one of them. “If that was intimidating, then you must not have worked in politics long.” 
The debate became heated with Spreitzer at one point standing up and asking for his name to be removed as an author from one of the bills he had co-sponsored, saying it was an “unfunded mandate.” 
Youth corrections bills
Several of the bills the Senate voted on came out of a study committee held over the summer of 2024 charged with considering legislative solutions to issues with the emergency detention of minors.
One bill — SB 106 — would establish psychiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTF) in Wisconsin. The facilities are meant to offer long-term treatment for children diagnosed with psychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder, disruptive behavior disorders, substance use disorders, severe emotional disturbance or post-traumatic stress disorder. Lawmakers want to establish the facilities to help prevent minors from being sent out of state when they’re in crisis. 
“We’re willing to vote for this if it’s real, if it has funding,” Smith said. One of the Democrats’ proposed amendments to the bill would have provided DHS with nearly $1.8 million in 2025-26 and 2026-27 for the administration and funding of PRTFs. 
Sen. Eric Wimberger called Democrats’ amendments a “stunt” and said the Wisconsin Supreme Court had changed the rules for how Wisconsin does the budget. 
“If we were to put an appropriation in the bill, he could line-item the whole thing and just take the money,” Wimberger said. “We’re going to maintain the authority of our branch.”  
Wanggaard said that if Evers vetoes the bill it is on him and not on the Legislature. 
Other bills passed by the Senate that Democrats said needed money attached included:

SB 108, which requires the Department of Health Services (DHS) to develop an online portal that would facilitate sharing of safety plans for a minor in crisis with specific people. Democrats had requested $1 million in funding to be attached.


SB 111, which establishes that counties are responsible for the transportation of a minor to emergency detention if they approve detention for a minor. Democrats wanted to include open-ended funding, while an amendment was made to provide a specific amount of funding. 
SB 182, co-authored by Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) instructs the Technical College Board to provide grants to technical colleges that provide emergency medical services courses that train and prepare people for their initial certification or licensure as an emergency medical responder or services practitioner. The bill also instructs the Higher Educational Aids Board to reimburse students or their employers for tuition and materials necessary for someone to qualify for the initial certification or licensure as an emergency medical responder or an emergency medical services practitioner.
SB 283, which requires the Department of Transportation to establish and administer a public protective services hearing protection program. 

Assembly talk about education, child care plans
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said on Wednesday morning ahead of the Assembly floor session that the proposals from Republican lawmakers aren’t adequate.
“Our public schools are in crisis. Our communities are being forced to go to referendum year after year, our child care industry needs direct investment to keep it afloat, and our universities need essential dollars to provide the best services for our students,” Neubauer said. She added that Republican lawmakers declined to raise special education funding in schools to 60% and are preparing cuts to the University of Wisconsin system.
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said his caucus supports cutting $87 million from  the UW system, but wouldn’t say if that’s the final proposal the budget committee will take up. The system has said it needs additional funding and Evers had requested $855 million in his proposal for it. Vos says Republicans want “reform” of the UW for the “broken process that we currently have.”

“That would have serious consequences for economies across Wisconsin and the future of our state. A cut like that could mean closed campuses — the Platteville, River Falls or Stevens Point Marathon County — at risk,” Neubauer said. “Cuts like that would have consequences for thousands of students, staff, and faculty, and is just unacceptable.” 
Neubauer said that lawmakers need to work with Evers and Democrats to pass a budget that will “ensure the continuity of essential services” in Wisconsin.
“There is still too much political correctness on campus,” Vos said. “We don’t have enough respect for political diversity — heaven forbid, if you’re a student who’s Jewish or has a different viewpoint on campus, where you feel like you’re either targeted or the victim of potential hate.” 
During the last legislative session, Republican leaders leveraged pay raises and funding for building projects to get the UW system to concede on diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Assembly Republicans also announced their plans to address the child care crisis in Wisconsin — again rejecting Democrats’ calls for funding Child Care Counts, which faces a quickly approaching deadline for when funding runs out. Evers had requested a $480 million child care measure and some providers have argued it’s necessary to help keep child care businesses open. 
The outline announced Wednesday includes allowing 16-and 17-year-olds to staff child care facilities as assistants and to count towards staff to child ratios, increasing the number of children that a family provider can have from 8 to 12 and creating a zero-interest loan for child care providers and a 15% tax credit for the business expenses at a child care facility.
Vos said Democrats’ approach to the child care issue wouldn’t be effective. He said Republicans’ plan was “comprehensive” and a “good idea.”
“The plan that they have basically put out is saying that the way we drive down the price of groceries is to pay the owner of the grocery store more, hoping that it will trickle down to cost carrots and eggs less,” Vos said. “What we prefer to do is to give the money to the consumer to the parents to actually make those decisions.” 
Shawn Phetteplace, national campaign director for Main Street Alliance, told the Examiner that the proposal is a sign that Republicans are “deeply unserious” about working to improve the child care crisis. 
“If you look at what the actual crisis is in child care, it is the fact that parents can’t afford it, and that providers do not make enough to be able to make a living and stay and enter the industry. We believe at Main Street Alliance that the solution to this is to invest in the Child Care Counts program and not to do budget gimmicks that have been proven to be failures over the years.” 
Phetteplace said that Vos’ grocery comparison was “oddly” appropriate given that the U.S. already subsidizes farmers. 
“We provide generous subsidies to allow them to have consistent, predictable markets for their goods,” Phetteplace said. “What we’re asking for is to make sure that the child care providers are making enough, and the parents can afford it to ensure that we have a market and child care that works for Wisconsin families. The proposal today by the Speaker and Assembly Republicans is simply an effort to deflect this issue and to make it less politically salient. We believe that is not the right approach, and we urge them to get serious and to negotiate with [Evers].” 
The Joint Finance Committee is scheduled to meet to continue its work on the budget Thursday.

The Wyoming Department of Transportation has bumped back a weekend closure of Teton Pass, with the road now scheduled to shut down at 6 p.m. June 27 and reopen at 6 a.m. June 30, in time for the morning commute.
Final fix for Teton Pass landslide will require a weekend closure

“We had some rain recently that put us behind schedule, and we wanted to make sure the crews were absolutely ready for the compressed weekend schedule,” WYDOT resident engineer Bob Hammond said in a Tuesday statement. “We didn’t want to schedule the closure during the week and disrupt commuters, so we opted to move the work to the following weekend.”
Closing Wyoming’s busiest two-lane highway, even for a weekend, during the height of the summer tourism season will disrupt travel for thousands of commuters and visitors who rely on Teton Pass. But trying to do the work without a full closure would drag out that disruption, WYDOT says.

Once the closure commences, crews will work 24 hours a day to complete the job. Crews will be paving the final stretch of new roadway after a painstaking rebuild of the “Big Fill,” which collapsed last year.
During the closure, motorists will have to detour through Swan Valley, Alpine and the Snake River Canyon. The mountain pass accommodates an average of 10,000 vehicles per day.
“I know that rescheduling the work will impact people’s daily lives, but we want to be sure we are ready when the weekend comes,” Hammond said in Tuesday’s update.

The highway will be closed between the Coal Creek Campground on the west side and the gate at mile marker 7 on the east side. People can still bike and otherwise recreate on the east side of Teton Pass and access the Coal Creek Campground on the west side. But WYDOT is warning walkers and bikers to beware of heavy trucks and not descend from the top of the pass down the west side toward the work site.

The broader world is always present in Wyoming, columnist David Romtvedt writes.
The post Remembering where we come from appeared first on WyoFile .","It’s June. I look out my office window and watch the baby robins in a tree only six feet away. The young birds squawk and rock at the edge of their nest as they consider taking their first flight. Later, I tend the garden, amazed by the almost visible daily growth of the raspberry and tomato plants. I make dinner and wash the dishes after eating. I walk along the creek, the water rising as the snow melts in the mountains above town. This is the shape of daily life for me in Wyoming. 

Opinion

And yet the broader world is always present. Migration is one of the most obvious ways I feel this. Some 57.4% of Wyomingites were born outside the state, according to the five-year American Community Survey. With a total 2024 US Census population of 587,618, this means that 337,292 of us have moved here from somewhere else. While the leading sources of newcomers are the states of Colorado, California, Utah and Nebraska, the 2024 census also shows that 3.5% of Wyomingites were born outside the country. That’s 20,566 of us who are first-generation Americans. The largest numbers of our immigrant neighbors have come from Mexico, China and Canada, but many other countries have contributed to Wyoming’s population. Indeed, aside from the original Native peoples, we are migrants from the entire planet.
I first came to Wyoming in 1984 and have now lived here for more than half my life. But I was born in Oregon and raised in Arizona. I attended school in those two states along with Texas and Iowa. I’ve worked extensively in Alaska, Washington and Montana, with shorter-term jobs in New York, Arkansas and Illinois. I’ve also lived and worked in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, India, Argentina, Mexico, Nicaragua and the Basque Country. Then there was my very brief stint as an undocumented worker on a landscape gardening crew in British Columbia.
In coming to Wyoming, I felt I’d come to a new country, a place with people whose experience, different from my own, would enrich my life. I wonder if my sense of displacement, coupled with the pleasure I’ve taken in my new home in Wyoming, arose from my family’s immigration history, a history of constant motion, of longing to be settled.
One of my great-grandmothers on my mother’s side was a Sephardic Jew who fled the Iberian Peninsula for Amsterdam, then a haven for Jews. Rather than stay in Amsterdam, though, she went north to Norway, where she married into a family of Lutheran ministers and farmers who wrote poetry and ran a newspaper on the side. My great-grandfather, who did all four of these things, took especially seriously his role as a small-town journalist, writing on behalf of Norwegian independence from Sweden. In danger of arrest for his opinions, he and his family left for the United States, landing in Minnesota, where many Scandinavians already lived. 
His son, my grandfather, moved on, saying of Minnesota’s winters, “If I’d wanted to stay in Norway, I would have.” He went to Texas but was uncomfortable there, too. “Too hot,” he said and headed farther west, to live on the Oregon coast in a Bellamy Colony, a rural experiment in communal life with shared property and labor.
My father’s mother was born in Victoria, British Columbia shortly after her Belgian Catholic family arrived there. She claims her birth was on the boat as it sat moored in the inner harbor. Over time, more people from both sides of the family immigrated, almost all of them ending up in British Columbia, Washington, or Oregon, so as a kid I felt both and neither Canadian and American.
My parents served in WWII — my mother as a Women’s Army Corps clerk and my father as an Army Air Corps tail gunner in a B-25 medium range bomber. Twice injured, he spent 11 months in a Greenville, South Carolina, hospital undergoing reconstructive facial surgery. When I was a small child, he moved our family to southern Arizona seeking relief from debilitating rheumatoid arthritis. I grew up there in mixed Anglo and Chicano communities and schools. My classmates were largely Mexican Americans whose family roots often dated back to the time before the US invasion of Mexico in 1845 and the appropriation of over one-third of Mexico’s national territory. Once upon a time, Arizona was Mexico. Moving here, I remembered that in those days, a small sliver of southern Wyoming was part of Mexico, too.
That’s the condensed history of my American family, a family shaped by flight and arrival, seeking to find a home. And that’s where I’d like to end — having come to Wyoming and made a life here, a life shaped both by the unique history of this place and by the broader history it shares with the country and the world.

Equality State politicians have butted heads before. But it’s rare to see it play out so publicly.
The post Gordon, Gray feud escalates as Wyoming’s top officials grapple with mining, wind projects appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—Observers expected tension when Wyoming officials met early this month to determine the fate of a prized state property at the base of Casper Mountain. 
Since early 2024, a group of Natrona County residents has protested the development of a state-approved gravel mine at the site. They formed an organization and gathered tens of thousands of signatures. Soon local office holders amended zoning rules, effectively halting the project. Then the gravel mining company struck back with a lawsuit against the county. A month later, the gravel pit opponents filed their own suit. 
The dustup would come to a head at the June 5 meeting of the State Board of Land Commissioners, a standing panel consisting of Wyoming’s five statewide elected officials. The mine operator’s state-land leases were up for renewal, and stakeholders awaited the board’s ruling on the fraught dispute. 
And yet, perhaps the meeting’s most contentious moments came in an exchange between Gov. Mark Gordon and Secretary of State Chuck Gray, after the latter criticized the chief executive over his management of the meeting. 
“You need to be patient, sir, and allow the process to work,” Gordon said. 
“Mr. Chairman, I’ve been — I would like to respond to that,” Gray said. “I’ve been very patient with you in requesting the parameters for public comment on this meeting and they have never been provided. So I just, I really would appreciate that these continued false accusations towards me cease, thank you.” 
As the governor and the secretary went back and forth for the next couple minutes, the three other commissioners mostly averted their eyes. Some members of the audience audibly groaned. 
It wasn’t the first time the two electeds had sparred on a state board issue. 
In the weeks prior, Gray took to social media to criticize Gordon for his vote on a wind farm lease on state lands. Gordon fired back in his newsletter. In the days before the June 5 land commissioners meeting, Gray also published a press release calling Gordon’s decision to keep the meeting in Cheyenne “a dereliction.” And when the board arrived at the gravel pit agenda item, Gray reiterated his “disappointment that this meeting was not moved to Casper to allow for public comment.”
(None of the public comments at the meeting that would follow — neither for or against the gravel mine — addressed the location of the meeting.)
“We smile a lot,” Treasurer Curt Meier chuckled after the meeting when asked how he deals with ongoing tensions between his fellow commissioners.

Over the years, Gray and Gordon haven’t seen eye-to-eye on a number of issues. That isn’t unusual for Wyoming’s top officials. Several former office holders and longtime political observers, however, told WyoFile it’s much less common to see those disputes play out so publicly in meetings and online, and in such acrimonious fashion amongst members of the same political party. 
At least one longtime observer of state meetings says the public spat has slowed the board’s process.
“The main thing I see is that issues that normally would be resolved with a discussion and a vote 10 minutes later now end up being issues that go on for maybe 30, 40 minutes, so it makes the meetings longer, ” said Jim Magagna, who lobbies for Wyoming’s agricultural industry. “And then other issues probably don’t get the attention that they deserve, because things got hung up.”
Origins and differences 
The acrimony between Gray and Gordon dates back to the secretary’s time as a state lawmaker, when the governor vetoed some of his legislation, Meier noted. 
As a lawmaker, Gray had led the charge on a 2019 bill granting the Legislature $250,000 and the authority to pursue a legal challenge against Washington state for denying construction permits for coal export terminals. 
The bill passed both chambers by wide margins before Gordon rejected it with one of his first vetoes as governor. 
“I understand and applaud the desire of the Legislature to be ever vigilant in protecting the economic interests of the state and its citizens. I share that same dedication and zeal for assuring that Wyoming is not harmed by the actions of other states,” Gordon wrote in his veto letter. 
“Even so, I can see no compelling reason for potentially confusing the courts, complicating matters at hand, disrupting the coalition of states friendly to our perspective, or introducing reasons to delay an expeditious hearing of the case currently before the court.” 
Gray called the governor’s decision “unfortunate” at the time, according to the Casper-Star Tribune. 
“The veto is detrimental to efforts to protect the coal industry from a radical Leftist political ideology that seeks to put it out of business by any means necessary,” Gray told the newspaper. “It’s going to take a team effort between the executive and legislative branches for there to be success on this issue.”

These days, Gray — like his allies in the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — casts Gordon himself as left-leaning for his “all-of-the-above” energy strategy, which involves low-carbon and renewable power sources. 
Outside the legislative process, Gray and Gordon have also disagreed about the executive branch’s rulemaking process. Last year, Gordon rejected two rulemaking proposals by Gray’s office, both on the basis that the proposals went outside the secretary’s authority. 
In August 2023, the Wyoming State Loan and Investment Board — another committee made up of the same five members — approved a policy to require companies doing business with the state to disclose any investment practices guided by environmental, social, governance principles. As members of the board, both Gordon and Gray voted in favor of the policy. 
Meanwhile, Gray proposed stiffer rules by requiring all investment brokers, broker-dealers and securities agents in Wyoming — not just those working with the state — to disclose ESG principles in writing every three years. 
While Gordon wrote in a letter to Gray that he also “vehemently opposes the national push” for implementing ESG, he also said “our zeal to oppose this radical push does not justify implementing rules that go beyond the legal authority of a state agency.”
Gray pushed back, maintaining his office acted within its legal bounds, and said that “Wyoming needs real leadership on these issues, rather than the defensive tone that Governor Gordon lays out in his letter.”
Months later, when Gordon rejected separate rules proposed by Gray that would have added proof of residency to the voter registration process, the secretary said, “they should have been signed.” 
War of words on wind
On May 19, Gray posted a photograph on X and Facebook of a wind turbine that appears to have a broken blade. Of the five statewide electeds, the secretary is among the most active on social media. 
“A photo of Mark Gordon’s outrageously wrong ‘vision’ for Wyoming,” Gray wrote in the post, in which he also tagged Cowboy State Daily and a Blaze News senior editor. 
Gray had been the sole dissenting vote when the State Board of Land Commissioners approved state leases for the Pronghorn and Sidewinder wind projects in early April. A few days after Gray’s post, Gordon responded in a newsletter — an unusual move for the governor, who tends to avoid public feuding.

“Typically, I have paid little attention to the insults our Secretary of State spews because they are bogus,” Gordon wrote. “But after Mr. Gray’s most recent social media lie suggesting my vision for Wyoming energy only includes wind power, the record needs to be set straight.” 
That Friday evening, Gray responded in a five-minute video posted to his social media. 
“In this video, I respond to Mark Gordon’s lies. He’s upset that I’m exposing the truth about Gordon’s left-wing, green boondoggle wind policies,” Gray wrote on the post in which he also tagged the governor, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, the State Freedom Caucus Network, Cowboy State Daily and two national conservative commentators. 
From their own perspectives 
WyoFile sent Gordon and Gray identical inquiries for this story, which included written questions about whether ongoing tensions are hampering their ability to communicate, work together and accomplish the people’s business. Both responded. 
“The ‘tensions’ are little more than a distraction. The Secretary seems overly eager to manufacture issues to garner attention from the media or get views on Facebook; it reveals his inexperience as a statesman,” Gordon wrote in an email. “It is sad that he wants to resort to half-truths or outright deception. My hope is he will focus on the demands of his current position, even if his ambitions to other offices are getting the best of him.”
“For my part, I am confident the people of Wyoming can see that I am singularly focused on ‘accomplishing the people’s business,’” Gordon wrote. “I will continue to work with him, and others, to protect our property rights, our core industries, our children’s futures, and strengthen our economy. That’s what I was elected to do by an overwhelming majority.” 
Gray says the disagreements between the two men center on policy, as Gordon seeks to “advance the most liberal policies possible, while providing made up excuses as to why common sense conservative policies can’t be achieved,” Gray wrote in an email. 
“Because his allies in the media also want liberal policies, they repeat his misleading claims and excuses,” he wrote. “But what has made us particularly effective is that I’m not afraid to stand up to Gordon’s false statements and expose them as being false talking points and excuses of the Left. Gordon understands that the exposure of how liberal his preferred policies are presents a particular problem for him. So Gordon responds to my statements with personal attacks and theatrics, because he doesn’t want to have a policy debate.”
Both Gordon and Gray’s full responses can be read here. 
Historical comparison
Joan Barron spent nearly half a century covering Wyoming politics before retiring in 2014. She can recall one other instance when two of the state’s top electeds had a similar kind of feud. It occurred during the 2000s, when Republican U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis served as state treasurer alongside Democratic Gov. Dave Freudenthal. 
The two had testy public exchanges fairly frequently, Barron said, particularly at meetings for the State Board of Land Commissioners and the State Loan and Investment Board. The coinciding boards are the only panels on which all five electeds serve together as a voting body. 
“It’s not uncommon for members [of those boards] just to rub each other the wrong way,” Barron said. 
But even then, most of Lummis and Freudenthal’s squabbles took place behind the scenes, Barron said, until a comment the governor allegedly made resurfaced and caught headlines more than two years after the fact. 
“If you cross me, I’ll cut your head off and you won’t know it ‘til it hits the ground,” is what Lummis recalled Freudenthal saying during a 2005 luncheon for the five statewide electeds, according to the Associated Press. 
Freudenthal didn’t deny he made such a remark at the time, but said if he had, it had been in jest. Lummis, meanwhile, said it felt like a threat.

Retired politicians weigh in
For Diana Ohman, a Republican who first served Wyoming in the 1990s as superintendent of public instruction and then as secretary of state, the times have simply changed. There’s less compromise among officials, she told WyoFile, and more of a my-way-or-the-highway mentality. 
“Politicians are choosing more and more just to go straight out in public with how they think, and not come together in a 10-minute meeting to talk about, ‘How can we iron this out?’”
While officials need to be transparent with the public, Ohman said, it doesn’t help negotiations when officials “start using social media instead of picking up the phone and talking to somebody or walking down the hall and seeing if you can make an appointment.” 
Those kinds of face-to-face discussions, Ohman said, weren’t without hiccups, but ultimately kept things on the rails during her eight years in office. 
“A lot of what we did had to do with bringing everybody around the table. And Mike [Sullivan] was especially good at it,” Ohman said. “He had no problem with calling up any of the electeds and saying, ‘You know, let’s get together. It looks like we’re kind of far apart on this.’ And for me, that was the saving grace.”
Mike Sullivan, a Democrat who served as Wyoming’s governor from 1987 to 1995, told WyoFile some of those discussions “weren’t necessarily pretty.”
“In many ways, maybe they weren’t civil, but I think they were much more civil than these days,” he said, adding that they were also more private. 
“I mean, you weren’t having them in public to try to gain an advantage of some kind.”
Former Republican Gov. Jim Geringer, who succeeded Sullivan and worked alongside Ohman, said there were no major disputes among the top five elected officials during his time as governor. 
“At times, we were challenging each other to fully understand maximizing revenue for the schools versus looking out for public interest in other ways. You know, ‘Should we be giving greater economic deference to certain decisions that the land board could make?’ whether it be by loans to agriculture or respecting tribal authority,” Geringer said. “There were differences of how we might approach it, but there was nothing that disintegrated into misrepresentations on social media. That’s the difference today.”

The bill — AB 269 — applies to drivers for delivery and transportation businesses such as Uber, Lyft and DoorDash who are hired by customers using online apps or similar technology.
It defines those drivers as independent contractors who are not subject to laws guaranteeing minimum wage, unemployment compensation and workers compensation.
It passed the Assembly on a vote of 56-36, with four Democrats joining the Republicans who all voted for the measure. In the Senate, it passed 16-15, with no Democratic support and one Republican, Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) voting in opposition.
As of Wednesday the Wisconsin Ethics Commission had no public reports on money spent lobbying for or against the legislation. But since early this year DoorDash has been running digital ads on WisPolitics.com and elsewhere promoting the legislation’s “portable benefits” provision.
DoorDash issued a statement Wednesday lauding the bill’s passage. “Dashers and customers in Wisconsin have sent hundreds of letters to the governor, urging him to sign the bill into law,” the company stated.
If Evers signs the measure, Wisconsin would be the first state in the country to enact such legislation. DoorDash has pilot benefit programs without legislation in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Georgia, the company said.
While the bill authorizes the companies to offer the benefit plans, it does not require them to do so. It sets the standards of coverage for such plans if they are offered. It also allows the businesses to establish deferred compensation retirement plans for their drivers.
“This bill will provide meaningful, affordable benefit opportunities for these independent contractors,” said Rep. Alex Dallman (R-Green Lake) at an Assembly press conference before Wednesday’s floor session. “They’ll be able to solidify that they get to choose when and where they want to work, the freedom that they have to be able to earn benefits through the work that they provide for these different companies, and be able to really set themselves up for a future of success by having things such as health insurance.”
A new independent contractor standard
The legislation lists four practices that would exclude a ride-share or delivery company from the independent contractor protections: If it requires drivers to be logged into the service on certain dates, certain times or for a minimum number of hours; if it terminates a driver’s contract for not accepting a specific service request; if it bars drivers from working with other such businesses; and if it bars drivers from working in any other occupation or business.
A company would have to flunk all four of those provisions to be disqualified.
In both the Senate and the Assembly, critics said the bill would serve the contracting companies, not their drivers.
“We don’t need to create a new category of workers with fewer protections, which is what this bill does,” said Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) on the Senate floor. “The sad realization is that all of the so-called benefits talked about in this bill may never come to fruition for any gig driver. And yet the bill makes mandatory the loss of employee status for every single app-based driver.”
Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin), said drivers testified in favor of the legislation that “they don’t want to be employees.” Bradley is the lead author of the Senate companion legislation. 
“If you watch any of the hearings, they’ll tell you, ‘We love the flexibility of being an independent contractor.’ They chose to be independent contractors because of the flexibility.”
Under state law and regulations, the state Department of Workforce Development (DWD) uses a nine-part test to determine if workers are employees rather than independent contractors, said Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) during the Assembly debate.
“The big problem with this bill, though, is that it actually allows the executives of these companies to dictate their own test to fit their own needs,” Sinicki said.
‘Difficult way to pay the bills’
“Driving for ride-sharing services like Lyft or Uber is a grueling, difficult way to pay the bills,” said Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee), who said he’s a ride-share driver.
He said the industry’s claims that a driver collects $25 or $30 an hour are based on the travel time alone.
“So in an hour, if I take two people on rides which cost them $7 each and I get about $3.50 from each of those, Lyft might report that I got $30 an hour because they don’t count all the minutes between the rides. But I actually gross $7 that hour,” Clancy said.
The bill allows a company to contribute up to 4% of a driver’s earnings to the proposed benefits account. He said Uber drivers have an average weekly revenue of $513, so 4% “would come out to just $267 a quarter” — too little to cover a health insurance premium.  
The bill aims to keep drivers from being classified as employees because “it’s far easier to exploit an independent contractor than it is an employee,” he said.
Clancy said drivers across the U.S. have been “trying to get recognized as the employees they are, and to try to get access to basic benefits and workplace protections and access to unemployment insurance, just like the vast majority of employees in Wisconsin.”
Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee), a co-sponsor of the bill, was one of four Assembly Democrats to vote for it.
“I heard countless testimonies from drivers who wanted the flexibility of being independent contractors,” Ortiz-Velez said, adding that she has received “a ton of emails, a ton of support” for the bill this year as well as in the last two-year session.
“This bill offers portable benefits that right now don’t exist,” Ortiz-Velez said. “It won’t exist if we don’t pass this bill.”
Dallman, the bill’s lead Assembly author, said on the Assembly floor that critics of the bill can simply choose not to work for the companies it covers.
“This is for the independent contractor and the freedom that they have to get ahead in life by working a couple extra jobs, a couple extra trips on a weekend to make a little bit of extra cash,” Dallman said. “While at the same time, voluntarily partnering with one of these companies . . .  to pay for their benefits, to pay for their retirement. Again, the opportunity for workers to make choices on their own to get ahead in life.”

(Photo via U.S. National Archives)Edda Fields-Black was working on a book about rice plantations when she came across the story of a raid in Beaufort that freed more than 700 slaves from Lowcountry plantations.
The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.
Fields-Black tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
 Harriet Tubman

Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.

“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
 Finding the story

As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands that drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

That’s how people should commemorate Juneteenth, according to North Dakota organizers and advocates for the federal holiday.
Juneteenth events across the state kicked off last week in Jamestown, but more community celebrations are scheduled in Fargo, Grand Forks, Minot, Moorhead and Bismarck in coming days, giving North Dakotans a chance to commune with neighbors, families and friends.
One of the featured speakers at the upcoming Juneteenth events, Frederick Edwards Jr. of Fargo, said he’s noticed an expanded interest in the still relatively new national holiday. He said sharing the commemoration with a wide swath of people is a way for members of the Black community to share their collective history with those who may not have been exposed to it.
“Because it is no longer seen as a secretive, mystery event, I think it does get a pedigree of importance,” Edwards said. “People are OK even talking about Juneteenth, whereas three or four years ago a person wouldn’t have even asked me what I’m doing for Juneteenth.”

Edwards founded a nonprofit focused on creating connections through cultural exchanges called Fred’s Dissonance. He said the holiday commemorates African Americans overcoming chattel slavery, and the sharing of that history with people from every generation can bring communities closer together.
He said celebrations of Juneteenth happened every year in the Twin Cities and other communities where Edwards lived even if it had only become a national holiday in 2021. He said the holiday is similar to an African-American independence day.
“People celebrate collectively at my events, and I know all across America they are having Juneteenth events that people can tap into,” Edwards said. 
Former North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed a bill in 2021 that recognizes June 19 as Juneteenth to commemorate the ending of slavery. Still, it is not an official North Dakota state holiday. Several county courthouses are closed.
Gov. Kelly Amstrong issued a Juneteenth proclamation that stated the national holiday recognizes “the triumph of the human spirit over slavery” and commemorates the “strength and resolve of Black Americans throughout our national history.”
The holiday is growing. Edwards said he used to have to solicit donations from communities in order to have the funds to put on some of his events, but he doesn’t have to do that anymore because of expanded knowledge and engagement around Juneteenth.
People have access to free digital toolkits through the National Museum of African American History and Culture for organizers to use to set up their own Juneteenth events, or for anyone to learn more about the holiday on their own, he added.

If organizations or groups need help planning a future Juneteenth event, Edwards said he’d also be willing to give them advice on how to organize the celebration, no matter the size of the city or town.
“My philosophy is community power sharing. My liberation is your healing,” he said.
Lyn Dockter-Pinnick, chair of the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition Board, said Juneteenth is more important than ever as some people attempt to “whitewash” American history and demonize previously celebrated ideals like diversity, equity and inclusion.
“For the community that is honoring Juneteenth to allow the rest of us in, first of all, I think is amazing,” Dockter-Pinnick said. “And secondly, including all of us is a way to recognize the diversity of this country and just never forget where we’ve been.”

Edwards attended the second annual Juneteenth event in Jamestown earlier this month and said he was inspired to see about 250 people attend — even in the rain.
Heather McDougall, chair of the planning committee for Jamestown’s Juneteenth event, said people in the community seemed more receptive to the event this year.
“The first year was such a good success and really showed people that it is a celebration,” McDougall said. “It’s about celebrating everyone in our community and our country’s evolution, and honoring all of that.”
She said the planning committee tripled in size, from four to 12, for this year’s event.
“I think we more than doubled our fundraising, which was essential to pull off this year’s event,” McDougall said.
To commemorate the holiday, McDougall suggested connecting with people who are celebrating and asking questions.
“Just be open, and curious, and ready to learn,” she said. “It’s the value of community. No matter who you are, what you look like, just knowing that there are people who are willing to show up for each other in that kind of a setting, that just builds bonds that can go so much further than the event itself.”

Jerome Zamgba, a member of Jamestown’s Juneteenth planning committee, is an immigrant from Liberia who came to the United States in 2006. After living in Pennsylvania, he moved to Jamestown in 2019 and opened JayCon Grocery.
He said he met Edwards at the 2023 Juneteenth event in Fargo, which prompted him to help bring a similar celebration to Jamestown the following year.
“If we talk about celebrating this holiday, we talk about celebrating Americans,” Zamgba said. “What we want to do is to bring people together, not just Africans, or African Americans, but everybody to come together to celebrate this.”
He said the Emancipation Proclamation was about more than just ending slavery.
“It was a good thing for America to have a better image of our country, of our people, and the things that happened, to do away with them and just come together,” he said.
Zamgba said the Jamestown Juneteenth planning group hopes to introduce a new event next year in Valley City.
“Everything starts from somewhere,” he said.




Upcoming Juneteenth events will be held on:

June 19 in Moorhead, Minn., on the Bell Tower lawn near the Knutson Campus Center at Concordia College from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.
June 19 in Grand Forks at University Park from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.
June 21 in Fargo at Black Coffee and Waffle Bar from noon to 3 p.m. and Broadway Square from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m. 
June 21 in Minot at Oak Park from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
June 28 in Bismarck at Kiwanis Park from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Advocates say it's overdue, as costs skyrocket.","Legislation now in Trenton would expand oversight of hospitals and health care costs. Advocates say it's overdue, as costs skyrocket. (Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Every day across our state, New Jersey families are struggling to keep up with the crushing cost of health care. Insurance premiums are skyrocketing. Copays are rising. Everyone is straining under the weight of rising health care costs, with some facing double-digit increases year after year. And taxpayers are footing the bill when public plans spiral out of control.
The question before us is will we continue to allow this tidal wave of hardship to crash down on working families, or will we take action to safeguard the health and financial security of our residents? Eighty-five percent of New Jersey adults worry about affording health care in the future, while 49% have delayed or gone without care due to cost. This is not sustainable, but it is solvable.
Earlier this year, Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds-Jackson (D-Mercer) and Sen. Joe Vitale (D-Middlesex) introduced A-5376/S-4299 that would codify and strengthen the Office of Health Care Accountability and Transparency to oversee cost and spending trends across the entire health care industry. Just as importantly, it would create an independent, nonpartisan commission to serve as an essential watchdog in the fight against out-of-control health care pricing, including by establishing cost growth benchmarks for health care entities and hospital prices.
In practice, that means we would no longer allow hospital systems or insurance giants to raise prices unchecked, year after year, without accountability. 
The commission would hold annual hearings, requiring hospitals and insurers to justify cost increases that exceed the benchmark. If those increases aren’t warranted, the state could mandate performance improvement plans or take corrective action. This kind of oversight already exists in other states like Massachusetts, Oregon and California, and it works. Cost growth has begun to stabilize, transparency has improved and policymakers have gained real tools to make the system more accountable.
Here in New Jersey, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Just last month, the State Treasury Department issued a blunt warning: the State Health Benefits Program for Local Government is in crisis. Cities and towns are pulling out in droves, unable to sustain the 20-25% rate hikes that have hit their budgets in recent years. And those municipalities that do leave the State Health Benefits Program still face 9-10% rate hikes each year. Family premiums in New Jersey have been increasing almost twice as fast as income.
These aren’t abstract numbers, this is money being pulled away from classrooms, road repairs, public safety, and essential services. This means property taxes are going up because we refuse to rein in outrageously high prices.
For too long, powerful interests in the hospital and insurance industries have operated without meaningful accountability, dictated prices without explanation, and failed to acknowledge the exponential rate increases that we know are happening year after year. While families agonize over whether they can afford to go to the doctor, major hospital conglomerates have failed to meet federal transparency standards and offer no solutions for the crushing rise in hospital costs.
We are entering a moment of serious fiscal uncertainty. The federal government has signaled deep cuts to Medicaid and other safety-net programs could be targeted next. Our state budget is under immense pressure. In this environment, we must pursue cost-saving reforms – not by slashing services, but by making the system more efficient, more transparent, and more equitable.
We cannot continue slapping Band-Aids on a system that is hemorrhaging public trust and private dollars. Our families can’t wait. Our cities can’t wait. The time is now.

(Photo: Angela Dennis)As cities across Tennessee prepare for Juneteenth celebrations with banners unfurling, vendors setting up, and leaders finalizing programs honoring Black liberation, a deeper question lingers: What does it mean to celebrate freedom in a state restricting how that freedom’s history is taught?
In Tennessee, state lawmakers have gutted DEI programs, banned books by Black authors, and restricted how teachers can talk about race and history in the classroom. 
This year’s celebrations have also come with cutbacks. Across the country, Juneteenth events have been scaled back due to shrinking DEI funding, canceled federal grants and  retreat from corporate support for racial justice initiatives. 
For many Black educators, organizers, and students, the policies feel like a modern day echo of the delayed freedom Juneteenth was created to mark. It represents a continued struggle for true freedom and liberation.
Republican supermajority passes bills to “dismantle” DEI in state, local government

“The attacks on our history, on information, professors, universities and on teachers, are horrifying,” said Tennessee State Rep. Justin Pearson. “One of the first tools of oppression is to deny the education of people. In this moment in Tennessee and across the country, we are seeing policies and practices that are very harmful to our society’s memory about how we have gotten to where we are.”
On June 19, 1865, enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been free for more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. That delay in freedom highlights, for many, the same struggle seen today as laws and policies seek to suppress the teaching of Black history and limit the freedom of education. 
What began as a regional celebration has grown into a national symbol of Black freedom, with Juneteenth becoming a federal holiday in 2021, signed into law by President Joe Biden. Gov. Bill Lee signed a law recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday in 2023.
“Recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday, while passing laws that harm Black communities, reveals deep hypocrisy,” said Pearson. “We’re still trapped by systems, academically, environmentally, politically, and civically, despite being technically free.”
For other community leaders, the recognition of Juneteenth as a federal holiday is significant but raises important questions about the intent and timing of such a move.
Chris Woodhull, a longtime civic leader in East Tennessee, reflected on how he and others were teaching the significance of Juneteenth decades ago, long before it gained national visibility.
“Back in the ’90s, I was teaching about Juneteenth with young people through our organization called Tribe One,” Woodhull said. “We were talking about emancipation and the legacy of slavery before it was popular.”
  “Recognizing Juneteenth as a state holiday, while passing laws that harm Black communities, reveals deep hypocrisy,” said Rep. Justin Pearson, a Memphis Democrat. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
When Juneteenth was made a federal holiday in 2021, Woodhull couldn’t help but notice the timing after the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer — and subsequent uprisings —and growing momentum behind the movement to defund the police.
“Juneteenth became a federal holiday not in a vacuum but in the wake of George Floyd’s death, when people were in the streets demanding justice, systemic change, and real transformation,” he said.
While he appreciates the symbolism of the recognition, Woodhull said it felt, in part, like a concession, a gesture meant to appease, rather than challenge systems of power. Still, Woodhull believes Juneteenth holds real significance, especially when it’s rooted in truth and history.
“There are a lot of well-meaning people who want to celebrate Juneteenth but don’t really understand what it means,” he said. “We can’t afford for it to become just another day off. The challenge is to make sure we’re not just marking the day but honoring the story, and the struggle behind it.”
In recent years, Tennessee lawmakers have passed sweeping legislation targeting the teaching of race, diversity and Black history. In 2021, the state passed a law banning divisive concepts in public education, followed by restrictions in 2022 on mandatory DEI training in higher education. These measures were followed by further legislation in 2025 aimed at dismantling DEI programs across the state.
Book bans and curriculum restrictions have also spread across Tennessee. In January 2022, McMinn County removed the Pulitzer-winning graphic novel Maus from its eighth-grade curriculum. 
That same year, Hamilton County established a review board to evaluate books for “offensiveness,” leading to the removal of titles with Black and LGBTQ+ voices. In Knoxville, 113 books, including Push by Black author Sapphire, were pulled from schools. Wilson County removed nearly 400 books, including works by Toni Morrison, while Nashville’s public libraries responded by promoting banned books during Banned Books Week. In Chattanooga, The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas was also removed.
Despite political efforts to restrict classroom content, educators across Tennessee are finding ways to teach Juneteenth and center Black freedom.
“Juneteenth has always been a topic I discussed in my classes,” said Dr. Learotha Williams, associate professor of African American and Public History at Tennessee State University and director of the North Nashville Heritage Project. “It’s one of those celebrations that has persisted.”
Williams believes Black history must extend beyond traditional classrooms. His courses split time between lectures and community exploration, including visits to historic sites. At Hadley Park Community Center in Nashville, he also led a community course on Black Nashville, taking community members to former enslaved markets and lynching sites. He draws that inspiration from Carter G. Woodson — the author and historian known as the “Father of Black History” — who urged scholars to consider whether their work uplifts or alienates the communities they study.

“That was one of the most rewarding teaching experiences I’ve ever had,” he said. “It involved students and many elders in the community engaging directly with their city’s history.”
In Knoxville, Dr. Melody Hawkins, a nationally recognized and award-winning educator, sees Juneteenth as an opportunity for reflection and liberation in classrooms, despite growing restrictions on educators like herself
“Whenever people hear about all the banned books, there’s this assumption that it means we can’t still do the work,” she said. “But you can still be affirming. We just call it being good teachers.”
She believes the focus should be less about restricted terminology and more about how educators show up for their students.
“Juneteenth teaches us about our history and also helps us build classrooms where Black students feel safe, valued, and free to thrive,” she said.
Her upcoming book, Black Girl in the Middle, explores how race and gender bias shape education for Black girls, particularly in middle school. While educators didn’t create the systems that marginalize students, Hawkins says, “we’re still responsible for how we respond to them.”
In East Tennessee, Black in Appalachia, an educational organization, preserves and amplifies Black history and community stories in the region, especially in rural areas where much of the history is whitewashed. Director William Isom sees the current climate as part of a larger historical pattern of erasure.
“From my perspective, none of this is new. This repression is just a continuation of our history,” he said. 
Isom points to Reconstruction as a parallel.










Juneteenth strengthens the whole idea of the American narrative and any effort to erase the difference in perspectives around this significant day.


– Adam Dickson, Langston Centre


 “If local archives and historical societies looked closely at how their communities were shaped by Reconstruction, and its dismantling, they’d see the throughline.”
His advice is to focus on community record-keeping.
“Everyday people creating their own records, sharing their family stories, can be more powerful than anything an organization can do.”
Adam Dickson, Cultural Director of the Langston Centre in Johnson City, runs a monthly public series called Community History 365. He believes the burden of preserving and teaching Black history now rests heavily on local communities.
“Juneteenth strengthens the whole idea of the American narrative and any effort to erase the difference in perspectives around this significant day,”  Dickson said.“For so long, the Black perspective around Juneteenth had been ignored. That’s why it’s such a pivotal moment and never really considered as it should have been so it was a pivotal moment.”
For Pearson, embracing Juneteenth is also about Black joy. He said it’s as essential as any political or educational fight. 
“There’s a song that says, ‘This joy that I have, the world did not give it to me, and the world can’t take it away,’” he said. “We are still here, despite everything that has been done to diminish our humanity. That’s good news. And we have a responsibility to carry the spirit of those who came before us, both in our struggles and in our celebrations. Because they persevered, we can persevere. Because they sacrificed, we can serve. Because they gave, we can do more.”

This story was originally reported by Errin Haines of The 19th.
Thursday marks the first national observance under President Donald Trump of Juneteenth, the day commemorating the end of slavery in the United States that became a federal holiday in 2021.
This year, it comes as Trump’s presidency has been marked by attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion and attempts to erase and minimize Black history as part of the American story. What does it mean to claim resistance and resilience in an age of exclusion?
For perspective on how to consider Juneteenth this year, I spoke to Dr. Kaye Wise Whitehead, president of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, the organization that founded Black History Month. Whitehead shared her insights on the politics of history, memory and race and why traditions matter even more in the current political climate.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Errin Haines: How do you understand the meaning of Juneteenth — not just as a holiday, but as a marker of America’s unfinished work?
Kaye Wise Whitehead: The country has significantly changed between January 19, 2025, and today. Every single thing that we have fought for — that, I would argue, we began to take a little bit for granted — has either been canceled, erased or is under fire. Juneteenth is no different.
We don’t wait to be celebrated; we celebrate ourselves. We celebrate our history, and we celebrate our contributions to this country. Our lives and our histories are etched into the stones of the buildings. So we don’t have to have a proclamation from anyone else but ourselves.
What does it mean to celebrate emancipation in a political era marked by rollbacks of civil rights and diversity policies?
This is why it’s even more important that we take a moment to stop and understand the significance of Juneteeth. Juneteenth, as a holiday, has been celebrated within the Black communities of Texas and Louisiana since right after American slavery ended. They did not wait for it to be a holiday.
That is really the message of the American historical narrative. It is the people that lead the government. It’s not government leading the people. It is “We the People.” And Juneteenth is a great example of that.
If we don’t center the teaching and the understanding of Black history, if we don’t amplify it, if we don’t force it onto America’s agenda, then it can be erased. People don’t understand that if you erase the contributions of Black people to America, you are essentially erasing the American historical narrative, because Black history is American history. It is tied to the fabric that makes up the blanket of this country.
Juneteenth is a celebration. It is a time of firing up the grill, it is a time to line dance, of getting out the fans, and celebrating the beauty and the wonder and the joy that is essentially in the heart of Black culture. Our culture is not rooted in just tears and tragedy and trauma and slavery and oppression and lynching. Our culture is rooted in joy and laughter and tenacity and the ability to overcome and find places of happiness despite what the situation is around us.

What parallels do you see between the delayed freedom of Juneteenth and the current efforts to delay or deny racial progress — whether in education, policy or civic life?
We are not powerless in the face of those who seek to erase us. In fact, this is the best time for us to reclaim our power — our history is a part of this story. We can turn all of our spaces into freedom schools: a church basement, if you’re standing in the middle of a coffee shop, if you’re sitting with young children. You put it on your bags, you put it on your T-shirt, you put it on your social media. They can’t stop us from telling our story. Even though they are banning books, they don’t stop me from buying books and giving them to people. We have to take back our power in this moment, because otherwise, that is how authoritarianism wins. It makes you believe you’re powerless.
You’ve spoken and written powerfully about memory as resistance. How does celebrating Juneteenth become a form of resistance in a time of historical erasure?
I argue that you only have four choices right now. You fight, which to me means practicing small, daily acts of resistance. You have flight: If you have an exit plan, you activate it — and most folks do not. You freeze, and you pretend that everything is normal and that you pretend you can’t do anything. Or you fawn: You bend your knee and you kiss the ring and say, “I support this administration.”
I’m telling people, choose to fight and practice small, daily acts of resistance. Unfortunately, in this environment, celebrating Juneteenth is an act of resistance.
I believe that this moment is about both reclaiming the historical memory, but it’s also about a moment of looking forward, because if we stand right now and say that we’re not going to be erased, we are holding fast to our memory, we’re holding fast to our history, we’re holding fast to our contributions, then we’re laying the groundwork, setting up the framework for what’s going to come next.
What role have Black women played — historically and now — in defending and advancing the truth of our history against efforts to distort or erase it?
Black women have always been, as Zora Neale Hurston has said, “the mules of the world.” I talk about this as Black women being the ones that are willing to push and carry this country forward, because that is what we have done, whether it was during the time of American slavery trying to hold our family together, whether it was using quilts to stitch a road to freedom, whether it was braiding in routes to freedom in the hair of our children. Or as 19th-century women lifting as they climb, setting up club groups, raising money for the family, or coming today with the political activism that Black women have continued to be involved in and have continued to stand firm on trying to save this country, politically, culturally, socially and economically, for hundreds of years.
We’re at a moment now where a number of Black women are saying, “This is a moment that we sit out. We are tired. We’re exhausted. We’ve been teaching and reteaching the same lessons.” I’m making the argument that as much as I want to sit down, I cannot, as much as I want to stop I cannot. I can take rest breaks, but I do have to keep pushing the work, I do have to keep getting involved politically. I do have to keep talking about the reclamation of memory and history. I do have to keep standing up and resisting, even in very small ways. We are planting seeds for trees that will never give us shade. I am very clear that the work I’m doing right now is not work that I’m going to actually benefit from.
So then, what does rest, joy and celebration look like for Black women in this political climate? How do Black women hold space for both resistance and restoration?
That’s where Juneteenth comes in! Juneteenth is a great example of resistance and restoration. I’m telling Black women like I tell myself: No one’s asking you to fight 24/7, we’re not looking for that. Even Harriet Tubman rested. So where are the moments when you can actively get involved without draining your social battery? Maybe it’s an economic choice that you made. I can choose to vote with my feet, to vote with my dollars, write an op-ed. I can’t go out and march, but I can call into the radio station, I can give $5 to the institutions and the organizations that are holding up the work. That’s what restoration and resistance look like. You choose the moments when you can engage and then you practice radical self-care when you can’t — and be honest with yourself about what those moments look like.
For people who feel disheartened by the moment we’re in, what do you say about the power of showing up?
I’m gonna say this, and I know that it goes to the opposite of what a number of folks are saying right now, but our ancestors didn’t stop.
We can’t be the generation that stops. I know I’m tired, but I can’t be the one where the baton stops. As much as we want to stop in this moment, we have so much to lose. We cannot offer our children and their children a world that’s so destructive and just falling apart because we got tired and we stopped.
If Juneteenth is a mirror, what should we be reflecting on this year?
I would not say Juneteenth is a mirror; I would say Juneteenth is a prism into what we used to be, into who we are now, and into who we can be.
I think Juneteenth this year should be a space of radical imagination. It is clear that whatever this form of “democracy” has been, it does not exist anymore. I don’t want to go back to that. That was not a space of freedom, equality and diversity. That was not a space where we could rest.
So since that system is collapsing all around us, let’s use Juneteenth as a moment of radical imagination. What should come next? What exactly are we working for? Because at times I ask myself, “What am I fighting to save?” We need to have a plan for how we go forward, not their plan, but our plan.
That’s how we should celebrate and uplift Juneteenth: Throw up the grill, party, get the fans going — and then while people are sitting around the table and they’re passing the beans and the corn, say, “What should come next?” Let’s get some plans on paper. Let’s start getting people into the room to have these conversations. Standing still is not what we want to do at this moment.

But just across the border from Hortman’s home state, Wisconsin Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden seized on the double murder of Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were shot dead in their home, and the near-fatal shootings of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, to mock Democrats and try to score political points. Van Orden falsely characterized the suspected shooter, a right-wing religious fanatic on a mission to murder Democrats and abortion providers, as an anti-Trump protester who “decided to murder and attempt to murder some politicians that were not far Left enough for them.”
This wildly misleading analysis came straight out of the MAGA alternative reality machine on social media, where, Minnesota Reformer editor J. Patrick Coolican wrote, right-wing influencers began peddling misinformation about Hortman’s murder just hours after it happened. 
Van Orden was not alone in helping to spread those lies. Wisconsin’s former Republican Gov. Scott Walker also did his part. In a now-deleted post on X, Walker wrote that if the assassination “ends up being done by an ultra-liberal activist … watch for many on the left to be silent or even justify it. Wrong!” 

It is now clear that suspected murderer Boelter was a Republican who, as an evangelical Christian minister, gave sermons railing against abortion and LGBTQ people. Walker at least had the good sense to take down his post — lapsing into the silence he’d predicted “many on the left” would observe. 
Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah was shamed by his colleagues into taking down a similarly callous post in which he blamed “Marxists” for the murders and appeared to gloat that it was a “nightmare” for Walz. 
Van Orden, on the other hand, doubled down.
“I stand by my statement,” he wrote on X after U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan chastized him for replying to Walz’s remembrance of Hortman by saying that the Democratic governor is “stupid” and a “clown.” Van Orden responded to Pocan with an obscenity. That’s the post he stood by.
Van Orden, who attended the Jan. 6 rally in Washington after President Donald Trump lost the 2020 election alongside the Capitol insurrectionists, is hardly a model of statesmanship. His boorish behavior in Washington on more than one occasion has embarrassed our state.
But there’s something more troubling going on here than one politician’s loutish behavior. 
The horrifying political assassination in Minnesota is a direct result of the same MAGA disinformation machine that went into overdrive trying to distort the truth about the assassin’s aims. Van Orden is one of many Republicans who have hyped the idea that the U.S. is under attack from “criminal, illegal aliens” who were allowed by the Biden administration to “wander around the nation at their leisure.” (In fact, immigrants commit violent crimes at lower rates than U.S.-born citizens, and Van Orden’s district is full of hardworking immigrants who lack legal status but without whom Wisconsin’s dairy industry would collapse.)
Republicans following Trump’s lead have stirred up a moral panic around immigration, abortion, LGBTQ people and other non-threats in increasingly hysterical terms. Their rhetoric laid the groundwork for actual physical violence. It has been used to justify the unprecedented spectacle of masked federal agents seizing people on U.S. streets and deporting them without due process, as well as the Trump administration’s outrageous manhandling and handcuffing of Judge Hannah Dugan in Milwaukee, Sen. Alex Padilla in California and a mayoral candidate and Comptroller Brad Lander in New York City.  
Trump’s invitation to physical violence against his opponents and the press are a hit with his base. It seems inevitable that eventually someone would take him up on it. 
Adding fuel to the fire, Trump’s MAGA minions have made his sociopathic callousness part of their brand. Trump refused to call Walz after the murders in Minnesota, and instead took a gratuitous swipe at the man who campaigned against him as Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate in 2024, calling him “whacked out” and “a mess.”
 “I could be nice and call, but why waste time?” Trump told reporters. 
In a terse statement, Walz spokesperson Teddy Tschann explained why: “Governor Walz wishes that President Trump would be a President for all Americans, but this tragedy isn’t about Trump or Walz. It’s about the Hortman family, the Hoffman family, and the State of Minnesota, and the governor remains focused on helping all three to heal.”
What happened in Minnesota is a tragedy for all of us. It’s made worse by the lack of leadership from politicians who not only don’t have the wisdom and maturity to respond appropriately, but who, by failing to take responsibility for their actions, are actively propelling us toward a more terrible future.

Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) speaks at a Republican news conference Wednesday before the Senate's floor session. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)On unanimous voice votes, lawmakers approved legislation Wednesday that allows nurses with advanced training to practice independently in Wisconsin.
The bill now heads to Gov. Tony Evers, who vetoed similar bills twice before but who is now expected to sign the measure after negotiating changes to address his previous objections.
“I can’t stress what a team effort this was. It was bipartisan,” said Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc), the lead Assembly author on AB 257, before the vote on the Assembly floor. “People put their pettiness aside and they actually got a good product across the finish line.”
The Assembly passed the legislation Wednesday and the Senate concurred later in the day.
“While this legislation had been vetoed in the previous two sessions, I’m proud to say and stand before you that we have an agreement and a deal that when this reaches the governor’s desk, that is going to become law,” said Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point).
The bill creates a new formal nursing credential under state law, Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN).
To win Evers’ signature, authors of the bill agreed to increase the amount of training and supervision before an APRN can practice independently, added additional supervision requirements for APRN practitioners who specialize in pain management and included language to restrict the titles APRN practitioners use so patients aren’t confused about their credentials.
Evers previously vetoed APRN measures in 2022 and 2024, specifying in his veto messages that he didn’t sign them because of those issues.
“I wish it didn’t take us nearly a decade to do this,” said Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) in the Assembly floor session. “But It needed to and I’m glad that we’re getting it done now and I’m glad that we’re getting it done right.”
Under the proposal, the Wisconsin state nursing board would oversee the credentialing of advanced practice nurses. The credential would include certified nurse-midwives, certified registered nurse anesthetists, clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners.
“This is a really important bill,” said Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Milwaukee) before the Senate passed the measure. “It is going to increase access to high-quality patient care for people around the state, but especially people in underserved communities.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Scientists at Southeastern Louisiana University have found dangerously high levels of toxic metals and other contaminants in Lake Maurepas and have traced most of the pollution to industrial and other human activities.
Led by SLU chemistry professor Fereshteh Emami, a team of researchers analyzed 400 water and sediment samples collected from multiple locations and depths in the lake from June through December 2023 and developed new methodologies to trace the origin of the pollutants, track how they spread and determine the factors that make them worse. The results were “alarming,” according to the study, which was published in Environments in November and accepted for publication in another scientific journal, ACS Omega, this month.  
The analysis revealed concentrations of heavy metals and nutrients far beyond the thresholds the Environmental Protection Agency considers safe. Arsenic levels peaked at 420% above the safe limit for lakes and 6,300% over the EPA’s drinking water threshold. Lead and cadmium were detected at similarly high levels averaging orders of magnitude above safe limits. Nickel, copper, and manganese concentrations were also observed above their respective safety thresholds.
Heavy metal exposure is known to cause severe health problems and can be fatal to humans. 
“I was just surprised how polluted the area is,” Emami said in an interview. 
Emami’s team at Southeastern developed new methodologies that allowed them to trace the pollutants to Pass Manchac and three rivers that feed into Lake Maurepas: the Blind, Amite and Tickfaw. It indicated that industrial and agricultural activities are major sources of the pollution.
The researchers also detected a spike in contaminants near Pass Manchac following the Oct. 23, 2023, “super-fog” multi-vehicle pileup on Interstate 55, indicating that toxic chemicals from combustion vehicles are also running off into the lake. 
The heavy metal concentrations found in Lake Maurepas are similar to those later detected following breaks in the waste containment levees at the Atlantic Alumina (Atalco) facility in Gramercy last year. Atalco’s toxic metals — which also included arsenic, cadmium and lead, among others — ended up in a public drainage system that flows into the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas. 
Although Emami’s new methodologies did not trace the pollutants to specific facilities, news of the Atalco incident brought to light a previously unknown event that aligns with their findings, at least anecdotally, Emami said. More sampling and analysis is needed deeper upstream into those rivers in order to further narrow down the sources, she said. 
The researchers found other contaminants in the lake, including high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and a parameter called chemical oxygen demand, which indicates the presence of organic pollutants in water. According to the study, all three parameters were elevated at averages beyond what is considered safe. Their methodologies traced these pollutants to urban runoff and agriculture.  
The samples contained other toxic metals, such as mercury, at levels that were within safe limits. But the study noted they still pose a threat to humans and the environment through bioaccumulation, in which low doses of a heavy metal can amass in a living organism over time and add up to a dangerous level. 
“Because of the non-biodegradable and bioaccumulative nature of these heavy metals, they could accumulate and biomagnify in fish and other aquatic animals,” the researchers wrote. “As a result, they could enter the human body eventually through the food chain.”
Emami said mercury is particularly dangerous because it easily bioaccumulates in crops and animals such as fish. Her team is conducting a follow-up study in which they are testing aquatic samples from Lake Maurepas and surrounding rivers for heavy metals and other contaminants such as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as “forever chemicals.”
Corinne Gibb, a chemist who works for the environmental advocacy Louisiana Bucket Brigade and was not involved in the study, said the research very clearly points to pollution that is flowing into Lake Maurepas from other water bodies.
“What they’re showing for sure is that the pollution is coming through those rivers,” Gibb said.
A Louisiana refinery spilled toxic waste into the community and knew about it for months

Southeastern has been monitoring Lake Maurepas since the proposal of a carbon sequestration project by Air Products & Chemicals. The company plans to use carbon capture technology to trap emissions from an $8 billion hydrogen manufacturing complex in Ascension Parish and take them by pipeline to Lake Maurepas, where Air Products will have the capacity to inject an estimated 5 million tons of CO2 per year about a mile below the lakebed. 
In the first half of 2023, Air Products performed seismic testing to map the geological formations under the lake. In August of that year, the company moved a large temporary drilling rig into Lake Maurepas that served as a test well for the collection of core and fluid data, which ended in early 2024.
Emami’s team initially suspected but were ultimately unable to link any chemical pollutants to Air Products’ activity in the lake. Aside from providing a multi-million dollar funding grant, the company played no role in any aspects of the study, its design or the decision to publish the results. 
“We’re committed to protecting the Lake Maurepas environment and ecosystem, which is why we have supported the independent monitoring of the Lake,” Air Products spokeswoman Christina Stephens said Wednesday after learning about the SLU study’s findings. “It’s important for people to understand the lake’s ecosystem, and as our work progresses we will continue to operate in a safe and responsible fashion.”
That still doesn’t assuage concerns of some local lawmakers. Rep. Kim Coates, R-Ponchatoula, who ran for office on a platform of protecting Lake Maurepas, pointed out the study shows the baseline water quality of the lake is already deeply concerning and could be made worse with general disturbances that accompany lakebed drilling and similar industrial activities.  
“Adding deep geological carbon sequestration to an ecosystem already under strain from nutrient pollution raises serious questions,” Coates said. “Even well-intentioned projects can have unintended consequences in such a delicate and dynamic environment. Until more is known, extreme caution is not just warranted — it’s essential.”
SLU’s study is the first of its kind to combine dynamic statistical models with water quality data to trace pollutant sources and their driving factors. This allowed Emami’s team to provide a comprehensive assessment of the chemical composition of Lake Maurepas based on a wide array of data. The methodology can also be used to predict when and where pollutants will flow or migrate to other areas, she said. 
“Using the models, we were looking for the origins of the pollutant sources, and I wanted to know if the pollution sources in the Blind River could [let us] predict what was gonna show up in Manchac,” Emami said. “And it did.”
Emami said Pass Manchac’s significant tidal exchange between Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain has allowed her team to conclude that the water quality and levels of pollution between the two estuaries are virtually the same. 
Until the start of Southeastern’s research, there was no ongoing public monitoring for toxic metals in Lake Maurepas.
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality spokesman Matthew Day said the public should be aware of existing fish consumption advisories, such as one issued last year for Lake Maurepas based on elevated mercury levels detected in fish tissue. However, the agency does not conduct any regular heavy metal monitoring in Lake Maurepas because it is not required under Clean Water Act obligations, Day said.

In her lawsuit filed against Lyft in January, Willford alleges she was “subjected to unwelcome, nonconsensual sexual contact, touching” and lewd comments during the ride.
Willford was picked up by a different driver than the person identified in the Lyft app, according to the suit.
Her experience — and those that other survivors shared with her after hearing her story — prompted Willford, a Democrat, to introduce legislation this year that aimed to require safety measures for both riders and drivers using ridesharing apps.
“In my mind, all of these things are very basic when it comes to safety,” Willford said. “They’re just so common sense that it’s been really disheartening and frustrating to me that Uber … threatened to leave the state if the bill becomes law.”
Her bill would have required rideshare companies to conduct more regular background checks for drivers, to create a program for passengers or drivers who want to audio or video record their rides and to develop other safety policies.
But following Uber’s threats to leave the state if the measure passed, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it in late May. The bill would jeopardize rideshare services in Colorado “to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers,” his veto letter said.
Colorado isn’t alone. State and city leaders across the country are looking for ways to make rideshares safer. But lobbying campaigns from Uber and Lyft in many cases are blocking legislation meant to strengthen protections for both drivers and passengers.
Uber and Lyft, the two companies that dominate the U.S. rideshare industry, argue they have sufficient safety features within their apps.












Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers — that sort of work is relatively new, so there's not a clear standard.


– Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy




“At Uber, we put safety at the heart of our operations, using technology, transparency, and accountability to help protect riders, drivers, and the broader community, with robust background checks and safety features like Audio and Video Recording, the Emergency Button, PIN verification, and RideCheck,” Uber wrote in a statement to Stateline.
“We remain committed to this work, and to dialogue with bill sponsors on sensible policies that keep people safe while protecting privacy and access.”
But there’s still a gap in regulations for rideshare companies because of their evolving technologies, said Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy, a left-leaning anti-poverty advocacy organization.
“Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers —that sort of work is relatively new, so there’s not a clear standard,” Roque said.
Uber and Lyft are employing lobbyists at the state and local levels. In Rhode Island, another state where legislators are pushing rideshare safety bills that the companies have objected to, Uber is on pace to spend $50,000 this year on lobbyists, according to the state’s lobbying database. Lyft has been spending $5,000 monthly on lobbyists in Rhode Island.
Across the country, Uber and Lyft have testified against measures in state legislative hearings and city council meetings. In Colorado’s case, a number of officials representing Uber spoke out against Willford’s legislation at committee hearings, while Lyft sent a letter to Gov. Polis urging him to veto it. Jerry Golden, Lyft’s chief policy officer, wrote in the letter that the legislation’s requirements “ignore and ultimately will not improve conditions for riders and drivers.”
Uber told the state Senate it would be “impossible” for rideshare companies to comply with the bill’s requirements immediately upon approval and that the  audio and video requirement is “not possible to enforce.”
“The intention of my legislation was never to drive out Uber or Lyft,” Willford said. “The intention was always to require a higher level of accountability and safety from them. But we can’t do that if they’re going to throw tantrums and pick up their toys and go home every time somebody asks them to do better.”
Safety for passengers
As a part of Lyft’s safety measures, drivers must complete annual background checks and mandatory driver safety education. The app is also programmed to check in with riders when drivers take long stops or deviate from the route they were assigned.
Uber conducts periodic criminal screenings for all active drivers and requires drivers to regularly verify their identity by sharing a selfie with Uber using the app. Both companies offer live emergency assistance to riders.
Between 2020 and 2022, Lyft reported 23 fatal physical assaults of people using the Lyft platform and 2,651 instances of the five most serious categories of sexual assault, according to its 2024 Safety Transparency Report. While incidents of sexual assault had decreased 21% since the last report, which covered 2017-2019, fatal physical assaults jumped by 185%.
Uber saw 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022 and 2,717 incidents of the most serious categories of sexual assault, according to the company’s most recent safety report. Despite a 22% decline in sexual assault and misconduct, there was an increase in fatal physical assaults since its 2019-2020 report.
State lawmakers in several states have tried to address rideshare safety concerns with varying degrees of success.
Pending legislation in New Jersey and Massachusetts aims to prevent sexual assault and misconduct against passengers.
The New Jersey measure would require rideshare companies to share information concerning sexual misconduct investigations into a driver and would allow companies to ban drivers during an investigation. It remains in committee.
The bill in Massachusetts, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Rausch, would create a specific criminal penalty for the sexual assault of a passenger by a rideshare driver. The bill also would deem any rideshare passenger incapable of consenting to any sexual contact during a ride.  A hearing on the bill took place yesterday.
“We need to be able to make sure that people are safe and that people can trust those kinds of spaces to be safe,” Rausch said.
In May, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation that creates criminal penalties for impersonating a rideshare driver. Starting July 1, the crime counts as a second-degree misdemeanor. Uber supported the legislation.
But in Rhode Island, Lyft is pushing against legislation that would require fingerprinting as part of criminal background check. Brendan Joyce, the Lyft public policy manager, testified against the measure in April, saying the fingerprinting requirement relies on the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information System, which Joyce said has incomplete data. He also asserted that fingerprint checks “disproportionately impact and have potential discriminatory effects on communities of color.” Uber also testified against the proposal.
Rhode Island legislators introduced another measure that would prevent people under the age of 16 from using a rideshare service alone. Both bills are being held for further study.
Driver protections
JC Muhammad, 57, has been a rideshare driver in and around Chicago since about 2016.
Now, he works full-time as an organizer for faith-based organizations and groups that support rideshare drivers, including The People’s Union, a membership-driven organization aimed at supporting workers in the city.
Muhammad was attacked by a passenger during a Lyft ride in 2022, he said. The passenger asked to borrow Muhammad’s phone and opened its Cash App. The passenger also hit him over the head twice, he said, and threw a brick at his car, denting the side.
“I was angry as hell,” Muhammad said. “I really wanted to engage the kid, but I said, ‘No, let me get back in my car.’”

After sharing the incident with Lyft, the company responded by saying it would not match him with that passenger again. But the person who rode with Muhammad did not match the profile of the person who originally requested the ride, he said.
Muhammad also said he couldn’t go to the police because he did not know the identity of the person who was in his car — and Lyft would not share the identity of the account holder who ordered the Lyft.
Uber and Lyft customers have the option to verify their account, but not everyone does, Muhammad said.
“That gives us some measure of comfort, but it really doesn’t do enough, especially when it comes to calling rides for other people,” Muhammad said. “The account holder may not be the actual passenger.”
Rideshare drivers across the country — especially those of color — are frequently harassed, according to a 2023 report from the Strategic Organizing Center. The center is a coalition of labor unions representing more than 2.5 million workers across the country.
The survey of over 900 app-based rideshare drivers found the majority had been verbally abused and more than a quarter of respondents were threatened with physical harm. Nearly 15% of the drivers were grabbed, groped or hit, according to the report.
There have been several incidents in Chicago where drivers are lured by a false account to a location where they are then robbed or attacked, said Deana Rutherford, the communications manager at the Chicago Gig Alliance, a subset of The People’s Lobby.
“These drivers just show up and they have no idea who’s about to get into their car,” Rutherford said. “And Uber doesn’t know who they are either.”
To address some of the safety and labor issues drivers were facing, the Chicago City Council began considering an ordinance backed by The People’s Lobby that would require passenger verification.
If passed, the ordinance would have also set a minimum wage for drivers, require companies to be more transparent about fares, have them disclose the details of driver account deactivations and more. Both Uber and Lyft initially opposed the ordinance. Uber warned the measure’s sponsor that the changes in pay rates would drive up costs for customers and force the company to cut 10,000 drivers, according to a letter Uber sent to a city alderman that was obtained by Stateline.
But Uber this week agreed to a deal that scraps Chicago’s ordinance in exchange for the company’s support for state legislation that would allow rideshare drivers to unionize, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

Measles outbreaks starting in May have grown to 34 cases in North Dakota, giving the state the highest rate in the country, followed by New Mexico and Texas. (Photo courtesy of Visit Fargo-Moorhead)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”











Now they’ve seen measles in their community so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’


– Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas



In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
Outbreak moves north
In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”

Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas
According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 13, there are 1,197 confirmed cases affecting 34 states. Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 21 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Photo by Jan Ellen Spiegel/CT Mirror)Connecticut’s Shore Line East commuter rail line, which serves nine train stations between New Haven and New London, is slated to receive a $4 million boost in 2027 to restore some of the service that was pared back in recent years.
While the $4 million adds an extra 10% to the line’s appropriated budget over the current year, and will add some additional trains to the line, advocates are concerned it won’t go far enough. Gov. Ned Lamont and the state Department of Transportation say funding for Shore Line East must be balanced with other rail service priorities, and they want to monitor ridership on the coastal route before committing to further increases.
The funding boost came after Senate Bill 714, which would have restored service on the line to pre-pandemic levels, failed to come up for a vote in either chamber during the waning days of the General Assembly’s 2025 session. Annual state funding for Shore Line East currently stands at roughly half where it was before the pandemic, and estimates for restoring full service to the line vary from $25 million to over $80 million.
According to the state Department of Transportation, nearly $40 million is authorized in the current state budget for Shore Line East in 2026 and $41 million for 2027. By comparison, the Hartford Line received roughly $60 million per year in the current budget.
The additional $4 million, secured for the second year of the biennial 2026-27 budget, comes on top of a $5 million boost Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, pushed to include in the current biennium budget. That funding came out of remaining federal COVID emergency funds.
The added funding will only expand service by a few trips a day between the shoreline’s nine communities. But Cohen, who co-chairs the legislature’s Transportation Committee, said it’s a start.
“We still have more work to do to restore service to pre-pandemic levels, but I am proud that we were able to secure an additional $4 million this year on top of the $5 million I secured in the last budget,” said Cohen, on whose request the sum was added as a line item in this year’s budget.
Shore Line East is the smallest of Connecticut’s six commuter rail lines, and it currently runs 20 daily trains, according to the DOT. It faced struggles beginning in 2018, when Amtrak’s seasonal track work reduced services significantly, advocates say. Then several incidents of trains malfunctioning further set back ridership.
“We kind of limped our way through, and then we got to COVID,” said Susan Feaster, founder of SLE Riders Advocacy Group. “So even before COVID, our numbers were starting to go down.”
In 2019, Shore Line East ran 36 daily trains, but COVID-19 led to further service reductions across all of the state’s commuter rail lines. In 2023, after budget cuts reduced the route’s service by another seven trains, the line was then running only 16 trains.
At the same time, other routes were seeing ridership rebound. The Hartford and the Waterbury lines, which have received millions in state investments to upgrade infrastructure and service, have exceeded pre-pandemic ridership levels. But those lines also serve some of the more densely-populated cities in Connecticut.

Last year, with the $5 million in American Rescue Plan funding, Shore Line East was able to add four weekday trains, along with round-trip direct service between Stamford and New London. While the ARPA funds were temporary, the $4 million secured in the next budget should help sustain that additional service.
For the last year, the line saw ridership just over a quarter of its pre-pandemic level. And last July, the line only carried only 18,559 riders as compared to over 60,000 in July of 2019. November was the line’s single best month since March 2020, with a total of 20,840 trips.
While the full impact of the four reinstated trains is still unclear — and DOT officials say they need more data — advocates estimate ridership has increased by 50%.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the governor’s administration wants to improve rail service by encouraging more housing development near transit, adding express trains to New York, and establishing a new bridge between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme — all of which is expected to speed up and improve service.
Shore Line East, Blanchard said, would cost more to restore to full service than any other rail line. “The current per-passenger-trip subsidy for Shore Line East is significantly more than any other mass transit option in the state,” Blanchard said. “We must balance the overall fiscal health of the [state’s transportation fund] with services that deliver value for Connecticut residents and businesses.”
The current subsidy per ride for Shore Line East is $183, as compared to the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line’s $6.48 subsidy per ride. Comparably,  in 2021 when ridership for Shore Line East began to drop, its subsidy per rider was $55.28.
Advocates maintain the line must be reinstated to full service.
Jim Gildea, Chairman of the Connecticut Public Transportation Council said, “Restoring Shore Line East to full service will not only improve accessibility but also strengthen our public transportation network, ensuring that it meets the needs of all Connecticut residents.”
Feaster said Shore Line East has received less support than other lines.  “It seems like every time our numbers are good, they keep changing the target for us,” she said. “Lamont said one of the problems was that we didn’t have enough housing down here, which was not a criteria for any other branch line– Danbury [or] Waterbury.”
Feaster and Gildea both argue that restoring more trains to the line is what helps build ridership, and not the other way around.
“With last year’s funding of $5 million, we are witnessing a dedicated effort to enhance our rail services, which is vital for attracting riders back to the line,” Gildea said.

Once home to more than 138,000 people, the city now has a population that hovers at 90,000.","Saeed Taraky, a 34-year-old Afghan refugee, arrived in Erie in 2022 following the collapse of the Afghan government. Taraky helped establish the Afghan Community Center in Erie which offeres computer courses, English as a second language courses and hosts events for the resettled Afghan community. (Dustin Franz)This story was originally published by Capital & Main.
In an office overlooking downtown Erie, Pennsylvania, Saeed Taraky pulls a pen from a box beside his desk. He presses the stylus, and a small light illuminates the barrel of the pen. A message reads:
“Welcome to America! Welcome to Erie, PA! Create a Great Future For You and Your Family!”
The pens will go to new American citizens after they complete their naturalization ceremonies, which Taraky conducts. The small gift is the kind of earnest and optimistic gesture that says a lot about how this Pennsylvania city approaches new arrivals.
Taraky, once a refugee from Afghanistan, is now Erie’s refugee and immigrant liaison. He and his family arrived in 2022, after fleeing the Taliban’s return to power, and found a welcoming community in Erie. Today, trying to provide the kind of welcome he once received, he helps newcomers resettle and coordinates an immigrant and refugee council that offers immigrant perspectives on city policies.
But for city officials in Erie, creating a welcoming atmosphere for immigrants is not just about generosity. It’s a path city leaders say they have chosen out of necessity. After decades of industrial decline, Erie has become a case study in how some Rust Belt cities are surviving by welcoming newcomers. Once home to more than 138,000 people, the city now has a population that hovers at 90,000. Erie’s ailments have continued long into this century. For the past two decades, factories and manufacturing jobs have been leaving Erie for the South and for Mexico. A major blow came in 2018 when General Electric, the city’s major employer for more than 100 years, sold its Erie branch.

Faced with declining industries and population, city leaders made a bet: What if they made their city a destination for immigrants and refugees?
“Immigration can be a kind of panacea for population decline,” said Elizabeth Jones of the Welcoming Center, which promotes immigration as a catalyst for economic development in the Philadelphia area. Immigrants are more likely to be working age, start businesses and file patents — key drivers of economic growth.
Erie embraced that philosophy. Its mayor, Joe Schember, made getting the city designated a “welcoming community” a priority. That has included promoting English classes, ensuring there are pipelines for immigrants to enter the workforce and launching a New American Council to gather insight from immigrants and refugees themselves. Research backs their efforts: According to a report by the Economic Research Institute of Erie at Pennsylvania State University at Erie, the Behrend College, immigrants contribute $253 million to the county economy each year, and thanks to immigration, the population has stabilized after years of decline.
While many local leaders credit newcomers with strengthening the tax base, filling essential jobs and revitalizing schools, not all politicians representing the area are as welcoming. And the progress the region has made in integrating new arrivals is now threatened by a resurgence of federal anti-immigrant policies — putting Erie’s fragile revival at risk.
Federal funding cuts have shaken refugee agencies. The three agencies in Erie, which provide resettlement services including housing assistance, English classes and assistance with the health system, receive a significant portion of their budgets from the federal government. Despite multiple court orders for the Trump administration to unfreeze funding, their grants remain paused.
“Given what has happened so far, we almost have to assume the worst-case scenario,” said Katie Kretz, the executive director of refugee agency the Multicultural Community Resource Center.
Kretz and leaders of the two other agencies appealed to the Erie Foundation in March for emergency funding. Since then, the foundation has set up a rapid response fund.But Erie’s other agencies, the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants’ Erie field office and Catholic Charities, have already laid off employees, and the future is uncertain.
While the U.S. — and thus Erie — has not accepted any new refugees since the start of the Trump administration, service providers are assisting recent arrivals on shoestring budgets.
“Hopefully [the anti-immigrant mood] is a short-term blip, and the longer-term trend is that we continue to realize the value of inviting new people into your community,” said Chris Groner, director of Erie’s office of development services.

Erie County is represented by Republican Rep. Mike Kelly, who has made immigration one of his key issues. “President Biden’s open border policies have turned every state into a border state,” Kelly said on the House Floor last year. He has specifically spoken out about crossings at the northern border given that Lake Erie forms part of the U.S. border with Canada. “If [immigrants] were wearing the uniform of a foreign country, we would think we were being invaded and we would say, my God, who is watching the border?” Kelly said at a hearing on the northern border in 2023.
Erie County, which is made up of a more progressive city surrounded by more rural, conservative areas, is known for being a swing county and a bellwether of national elections. Since 2008, a majority of voters in Erie County have chosen the winner of the presidential race. That includes choosing Trump in 2024.
Immigration was one of the top issues for voters during the presidential election, with Trump promising to ramp up immigrant arrests and deportations while in office. A September 2024 Pew Research poll found that 56% of registered voters supported mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.
Trump has made good on his promises, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting more than 66,000 people in the first 100 days of the new administration.
Yet people’s views are nuanced, as 64% of Americans believed that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the U.S. “if certain requirements are met,” according to a November 2024 Pew poll.
To Jim Wertz, a Democrat who is currently running for Erie County Council, anti-immigrant sentiment hasn’t been a noticeable problem in the city of Erie or even the county. “Regardless of political [identity], folks recognize the value of these communities,” he said, suggesting it may be because of residents’ real experiences with immigrants. “Folks here go to the grocery store and meet people actually affected” by anti-immigrant policies, added Wertz, who is a professor of broadcast journalism and digital media at Pennsylvania Western University at Edinboro.
That includes the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants.
Though officials in the city of Erie have said they do not expect the police department to work with ICE, the Erie County Sheriff’s Office has detained immigrants in Erie County Prison on behalf of the federal agency. At the end of February, nine immigrants were detained in the jail, according to Erie News Now, before some were transferred to a central Pennsylvania facility.
Against this backdrop, Taraky said that the city is planning to help “remove that gate” between immigrants and U.S.-born residents by inviting nonimmigrants “to see the culture of immigrants [and] what they bring to the table,” which includes the “food and fun” aspect of cultural integration: new cuisines, cultural performances and gatherings.
One of the new arrivals putting that approach into practice is Karim Hanif, a doctor in Afghanistan before he and his family fled the Taliban and moved to northwestern Pennsylvania. In February, he opened Ariana Halal Kitchen — the first Afghan restaurant in Erie. His son, Mohammad Abid, translated as Hanif explained that he wanted to work for himself and also give back to the Erie community. Erie’s Afghans love the familiar food; “The restaurant will be growing fast because a lot of Afghans keep coming to Erie,” Hanif said. But Hanif’s customers are diverse: He serves other Muslims who are seeking halal food, like Somalis and Syrians, as well as U.S.-born Americans who are broadening their palates, eating cuisine they’ve possibly never tried before.

There are at least 6,000 first-generation immigrants in the city of Erie, and more than half are refugees who were forced to flee dangerous conditions in their home countries. In addition to Afghanistan, Erie’s refugees hail from countries including Bhutan, Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, Burundi, Ukraine, Bosnia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Eritrea, Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Metropolitan areas in the Rust Belt were famously immigrant enclaves in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But today, these cities’ foreign-born residents tend to represent a relatively small percentage of the overall population compared to the U.S. average. Fewer than 7% of the city of Erie’s residents are foreign born, compared to about 14% in the U.S.
Even so, those immigrants bring jobs and businesses and inject money into the local economy, researchers across the country say. The city actively supports immigrant- and refugee-owned small businesses with microgrants, which have provided many of them with an initial infusion of capital. Immigrant entrepreneurs operate at least 100 ventures in the city, from day care centers and grocery stories to art galleries and auto repair shops.
For his part, Taraky remains committed to highlighting the benefits of immigration — both through his words and his wardrobe — as he supports newcomers in integrating into the community. On a day in March, he wore a dark three-piece suit, complete with a patterned red pocket square. Dressing well allows people in the community to see an immigrant as a professional, he said.
The hope, Taraky added, is that rather than clash, immigrants and nonimmigrants will “come together [and] understand each other.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Legislature held its first floor sessions after the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband and the near-fatal shootings of another state lawmaker and his wife. Leaders said that political violence is unacceptable and expressed willingness to discuss increasing security at the Capitol and for Wisconsin public officials.
Police have identified 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter as the suspected gunman in the assassination of Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor House leader Melissa Hortman and her husband over the weekend. He is also the suspect in the shooting of Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Boelter was apprehended Monday and faces federal and state murder charges. 
Wisconsin lawmakers had requested increased security in the Wisconsin State Capitol following the shootings and ahead of Wednesday’s floor sessions. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) told reporters that they made the right decision in requesting the increased security and said his caucus would be open to talking about new security proposals but it isn’t clear those are the right actions to take.
“Whenever an incident like this happens the most important thing that we can do is to take a breath and look at what’s going to be the actual best potential solution as opposed to a knee-jerk reaction,” Vos said. 
Vos added that the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) believes the Minnesota case may be one of the first political assassinations of a state lawmaker in the nation’s history and also noted that the “scariest” thing is that the shootings happened at the lawmakers’ homes.
“The idea of trying to make the Capitol into a fortress, I don’t know if that necessarily would even have ever done anything in this situation to help the awful situation that happened in Minnesota,” Vos said. “We’re going to talk about it as a caucus. I think we made the right decision to increase security here.” 
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) echoed Democrats at another presser, where lawmakers didn’t take questions. 
“Political violence is never the answer. We need to solve our differences through legislation,” LeMahieu said. 
Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) spoke about the attacks at a joint press conference ahead of Wednesday’s floor sessions. Boelter had a list of dozens of people including elected officials and abortion providers in his vehicle, according to police. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 11 Democratic lawmakers were found on that list.
Neubauer thanked law enforcement and her colleagues in leadership for coming together in a joint statement over the weekend to say that “no one should ever fear for their lives because of their service to their communities.” She said she and Hortman “shared a strong commitment to service and our communities” and that her heart is broken for Hortman’s family.
“I would also like to ask everyone to remember that these threats, even after the suspect has been apprehended, have had real impacts on the mental health of everyone affected, and we ask that you please respect the duress members and their families have been put through and extend understanding to them,” Neubauer said. 
Hesselbein said that differences should be settled with debate, not political violence.
“In addition to inflicting physical harm, political violence is meant to silence opposition. It is meant to discourage participation in our democracy by residents, by people thinking of running, by public officials. No one should fear for their lives because of their service to the community or because of their involvement in public life,” Hesselbein said. 
“I feel safe in our Capitol building. I think we’re going to continue to have conversations to make sure that everyone else feels safe as well,” Hesselbein said. 
Neubauer said Democrats are open to longer term conversations about security measures in the Capitol. 
Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) has suggested that Wisconsin should install metal detectors in the Capitol and should ban members of the public from carrying guns inside the building. 
State lawmakers have passed bipartisan laws in the past to help protect judges. While debating a bill — SB 169 — that would make a minor change to one of those laws enacted last year that provides privacy protections for judicial officers when there is a written request, there was some discussion about extending additional privacy protections for public officials. 
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said the bill speaks to keeping judges safe in their homes and said she hoped her colleagues would consider joining her in working on a proposal to extend privacy protections to anyone who serves the public in a public-facing role. 
“There are many people who serve the public in an important capacity, judges are certainly one, but legislators as well, constitutional officers… who are now in this world of high risk,” Roys said.
Vos earlier told reporters that the jobs of judges and state lawmakers are a little different, which could influence conversations about additional privacy protections for public officials in various roles. 
“State legislators are just so much more accessible, which, frankly, is like our superpower. We are the most accessible and the most responsive to the public because we are constantly at events, we are meeting with people, we are doing town halls. We are doing all the interactions that you want in a healthy democracy,” Vos said. 
During the Assembly Floor Session, Vos spoke about knowing Hortman, saying he met her through his work with the National Conference of State Legislatures and called Hortman “funny and engaging and incredibly smart.” 
Hortman was elected to the Minnesota State Legislature in 2004. “Over the next two decades,” Vos said, “she became a formidable force in state politics on her intelligence and her effectiveness.” 
“We all have responsibility when it comes to toning down the political rhetoric we use each day,” Vos said. “All political parties suffer political intimidation, name calling and the risk of physical violence, and we owe it to those who elect us to be role models for civil discourse.” 
The Senate and Assembly both held moments of silence for the Hortmans.
Vos and Hesselbein both read portions of the statement put out by the Hortmans’ children, Sophie and Colin Hortman: “Hope and resilience are the enemy of fear. Our parents lived their lives with immense dedication to their fellow humans. This tragedy must become a moment for us to come together. Hold your loved ones a little closer. Love your neighbors. Treat each other with kindness and respect. The best way to honor our parents’ memory is to do something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.”

But it saw hours of debate on the budget proposal as well as dozens of remaining bills, many of which traveled back and forth between chambers as lawmakers weighed which would pass and which would not.
However, the chambers adjourned shortly after 9:30 with several proposals left in limbo, including a data privacy bill (LD 1088) that the Maine House of Representatives rejected 77-70 but was never taken up by the Senate.
Ahead of the House vote, sponsor Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) said data privacy had been a “hot topic in caucuses” this week. Henderson’s bill is the version favored by businesses that uses a notice and consent model, allowing companies to collect data as long as consumers agree to it in privacy notices. However, the House has yet to vote on the competing plan, which was backed by the Judiciary Committee. Sponsored by Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), LD 1822 uses a standard called data minimization, which broadly means limiting the collection of personal information to only what is necessary to fulfill the consumer service. The Senate has yet to consider either bill. (Read more about these proposals here).
The chambers opted not to adjourn sin die, or finally, on Wednesday and plan to reconvene next week in coordination with when the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee “runs the table.” 
About 300 bills that passed both chambers but need funding still remain in limbo on what’s called the appropriations table. The appropriations committee, which manages this table, will ultimately decide which proposals to fund with any remaining unappropriated money.
Some of those proposals are bills to establish a task force to suggest reform to the real estate property tax, ensure the already required teaching of Wabanaki and African American studies are effectively taught in Maine schools, provide more funding for family planning services, fund proper disposal of syringe litter and expand testing for forever chemicals in private wells, among others.
It remains to be seen whether the chambers will also take up data privacy or other stranded measures when they return.
For now, here’s an overview of what happened Wednesday.
Both the House and Senate enacted a bill (LD 1971) to restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, after narrowly giving initial approval on Tuesday. (Read more about the proposal here.)
Both chambers have now backed legislation (LD 556) that would prohibit a municipality from banning a particular energy system or distributor, after the Senate voted 17-16 on Wednesday to align with the House in favor of the measure. Sen. Matt Harrigton (R-York) noted that many municipalities currently have climate agendas in which they outline future plans to ban certain heat sources, “we should be doing everything in power…to make sure those plans are halted ahead of time,” he said. Ahead of the enactment vote in the House, Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) said he feared this would be one of the most environmentally damaging bills the Legislature would send to the governor this session. The bill is currently being held in the House.
After initially rejecting the measure, the Senate voted 19-15 on Wednesday in favor of a proposal (LD 1270) to make the governor’s energy office a cabinet level department, following the House in support. The bill is now on the appropriations table. (Read more about this proposal here).
Both chambers rejected a bill ( LD 746) that would permit municipalities to impose a 2% sales tax on short-term lodging, if approved by referendum, to be used to fund affordable housing. (Read more about this bill here.)
A suite of bills aiming to amend portions of the Right to Repair law (LD 442, LD 1227 and LD 1394) were rejected by both chambers in light of the passage of another bill (LD 1228) that would clarify certain terms in the Automotive Right to Repair Laws passed by citizens initiative in November 2023.
Legislation (LD 532) that sought to study assaults on health care workers is essentially dead after the chambers could not agree on the issue.
Following the House, senators on Wednesday finally enacted legislation (LD 1666) that would expand ranked-choice voting for general and special elections for gubernatorial, state senators and state representative races. 
After both chambers insisted on their positions regarding LD 1298, which would establish an alternative pathway for someone to become a licensed social worker who has failed the licensure exam, the bill is now effectively dead. During the extensive House debate, lawmakers highlighted a tension between the state’s dire need for behavioral health support and the risk posed to children by having potentially unqualified people making important determinations about health and safety.
 education Emergency legislation (LD 549) directing the Department of Public Safety to establish a sexual assault forensic examination kit tracking system, and another emergency bill (LD 1816) to conduct an inventory of existing forensic examination kits in the possession of law enforcement passed both chambers with support of more than two-thirds of members, which is required to take effect immediately. They were both moved to the appropriations table to vie for remaining funds. (Read more about this issue here).

(University of Kentucky)
The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
 ‘All slaves are free’

Juneteenth – short for June Nineteenth – recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”

  The official handwritten record of General Order No. 3, preserved at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. (National Archives)
Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted,
“Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
 ‘Second Independence Day’

June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

 Legacies of slavery

While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”

 National recognition

Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”

 Backtracking on gains

But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

Buck Newton has reworked a House Bill intended to protect women and minors from exploitation to one that targets transgender surgery and access to public school library books. (Photo: NCGA video stream) Democrats serving on the North Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee asked Republican Sen. Buck Newton (R-Greene, Wayne and Wilson) a week ago to reconsider his efforts to amend House Bill 805 — a noncontroversial measure designed to prevent sexual exploitation of women and minors that won unanimous support in the House — into a vehicle to advance the conservative social agenda on issues of gender identity and sexuality.
On Wednesday, Newton gave his answer: “No.”
As Newsline reported last week, when the bill was first considered by the Senate Committee, Newton — a committee co-chair — put forth a proposed amended version that defined the state’s recognition of two biological sexes: male and female. Newton also proposed the state maintain the vital records of anyone seeking to change the sex on their birth certificate.
At Wednesday’s committee hearing, Newton went a step further by introducing new language aimed at transgender individuals and school libraries. One amendment would extend the statute of limitations on medical malpractice lawsuits brought by people who have undergone a gender transition procedure from three years to ten.
“We have a fairly detailed, longstanding malpractice system on our state. I’m wondering what the reason is for treating this particular type of medical care differently than standard malpractice and other kinds of medical care?” asked Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake).
Newton said individuals who’ve sought out gender transition procedures are often in a “very precarious frame of mind” when they make the decision to have surgery or undergo treatment.
  Senator Lisa Grafstein questions Sen. Buck Newton in a June 18, 2025 Judiciary meeting. (Photo: NCGA video stream)
“A lot of times they’re not aware of a lot of the circumstances, negative implications for themselves until much, much later after traditional statute limitations would run. So, we thought it was appropriate to extend it out to ten years,” said Newton.
Grafstein responded that more people regret knee replacement surgery than regret gender affirming care.
Newton said the extended statute of limitations on malpractice lawsuits was appropriate since gender reassignment surgery had become “fashionable.”
The Wake Democrat called that comment “snide” and an insult to people who make important life decisions around these issues.
 Parental access to library books 
Unrelated to the malpractice provision, a second change in Newton’s new version of the legislation would also provide parents with access to a searchable list of library books available at each public school.
Local boards of education would be required to adopt policies to allow a student or their parent to request that the student be excused from specific classroom discussions or assigned readings if they believe it “imposes a substantial burden on the student’s religious beliefs” or invades the student’s privacy by calling attention to the student’s religion.

Sen. Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) suggested the amendment as worded could lead to censorship, preventing a student from reading or learning about the Holocaust in school.
Brian Gwyn, a staff attorney and legislative analyst, said in that example students would be given an alternate assignment aligned with the standard course study.
“So just to confirm, the answer is a parent can forbid a child from reading books about the Holocaust if they believe that didn’t occur. Is that correct?” pressed Chitlik.
“From checking out a book in the library, that is correct,” answered Gwyn.
Newton could not answer as to whether the NC Department of Public Instruction or the NC School Board Association were consulted.
He said his amendment was intended to empower parents.
“We’re seeing a lot of instances of libraries being filled up with all kinds of materials at the very least or not age appropriate for the children who would check it out. Parents are totally in the dark.”
Grafstein said Newton’s assessment simply was not true.
“There’s a narrative out there that librarians, who we all grew up learning from and being guided by, that somehow, they’ve turned evil and they’re trying to harm children. It’s just a false narrative,” Grafstein told the committee.
 Part of a larger strategy? 
  Tami Fitzgerald with the North Carolina Values Coalition (Photo: NCGA video stream)
Tami Fitzgerald with the North Carolina Values Coalition praised the amendment for offering a remedy to transgender individuals who may later detransition.
“Second, it solves or attempts to solve the obscenity problem in our schools, both related to curriculum and library books,” Fitzgerald said.
Reighlah Collins, Policy Counsel for the ACLU of North Carolina, said the amendment and reworked bill amount to harmful attacks on transgender people.
“It’s part of a larger strategy to push transgender people out of public and civic life,” Collins responded.
Senate Democratic Leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) again appealed to Newton to strip out his controversial amendment and return to the original bill to protect women and minors, bipartisan legislation that raised no objections in the state House.
“You’ve been around this place long enough to know pretty much how it works, and so the answer to your question is respectfully, ‘no,'” answered Newton.

The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
 ‘All slaves are free’

Juneteenth – short for June Nineteenth – recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”

  The official handwritten record of General Order No. 3, preserved at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. National Archives.
Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted,
“Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
 ‘Second Independence Day’

June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

 Legacies of slavery

While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”

 National recognition

Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”

 Backtracking on gains

But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

The 6-foot-2 man had dropped to 115 pounds and sat drenched in sweat between bouts of vomiting at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. He sat before Rep. Becky Currie, chairwoman of the state House Corrections Committee, at the facility in the Delta known for its long history of deaths and violent disturbances. 
Currie, a registered nurse, could tell the man had liver disease. She asked that the man’s name be concealed to protect him from retribution from prison officials. Currie said the inmate told her he contracted liver disease from untreated Hepatitis C. The contagious virus can be treated with antiviral medication that, if administered properly, is highly effective, curing more than 95% of patients. 
The man said he had been asking for medication for years, to no avail. Another man Currie met in prison with Hepatitis C had blood ammonia levels so high that he was hallucinating and had been told he had three months left to live. 
“He didn’t have but a five-year sentence,” Currie said. “Now he’s got a death sentence.”
Currie voiced her dismay to Burl Cain, commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. 
Currie’s committee has legislative oversight of Mississippi’s corrections system, and Cain became aware of her increasing skepticism of the department’s ability to police the provision of health care in its facilities. 
So he told Currie in April that MDOC had withheld $2 million in state funding from the private company providing prison health care for having inadequate staff. 
But when lawmakers returned to Jackson in late May for a special session to set a state budget, MDOC requested an additional $4 million in a “deficit appropriation” – money to cover a shortfall – for the medical program provided by that same company. 
Currie said the money appears to be a bailout for VitalCore Health Strategies, canceling out any financial consequence the company was supposed to face. She also said there is no explanation for why MDOC is running a deficit for its medical program as sick prisoners languish without proper medical care, turning some short prison stints into death sentences. 
“A month ago, Commissioner Burl Cain told me that he had fined VitalCore $2 million for a lack of health care workers to be able to provide health care to inmates,” Currie said. “Then, in their budget, VitalCore and MDOC asked for $4 million to shore up a health care deficit. What this means is VitalCore and MDOC are working together to manipulate their budget.”
In a statement, an MDOC spokesperson confirmed the agency withheld $2 million from VitalCore under its contract with the company for staffing issues, but it said the financial punishment wasn’t a “fine.” It also said the $4 million budget request was to cover increased costs of providing health care. 
“MDOC has not ‘fined’ VitalCore,” wrote Kate Head, a corrections department spokesperson. “Rather, MDOC has withheld approximately $2M in proceeds under the contract due to VitalCore’s failure to meet certain contractual staffing requirements.”  
In a separate statement, Timothy Keck, a company spokesperson, said VitalCore has not received additional funds beyond what is outlined in its contract and has made progress hiring more medical staff. The company disputed claims that it denied treatment and said it complies with all state policies.
MDOC did not respond to a follow-up question asking why the cost of providing care had increased, the same question Currie kept asking as she embarked on several tours inside Mississippi’s prisons. Once inside the grounds of these facilities, the lawmaker says she witnessed widespread suffering. The suffering is preventable, and raises questions about how hundreds of millions in taxpayer money have been spent, she said.
“I disagree with them that they are living up to standards of care,” Currie said. “I am also aware that what money they don’t spend on inmates, they keep.”
‘Trapped here with no help’
Currie said the first man she met at Parchman later received medication for Hepatitis C, but only after she inquired directly with Cain about the holdup. 
She said the episode further affirmed to her that untreated illness among prisoners was not happenstance but the result of deliberate decisions made by those tasked with caring for inmates. 
Allegations that Mississippi denies inmates treatment for Hepatitis C stretch back years. The denial of medication, either willful or the result of mismanagement, has caused Hepatitis C to go untreated inside Mississippi’s prisons, Currie said she found while touring jails. 
But that isn’t all she found. 
Currie met a 23-year-old woman with a lump growing out of her breast from untreated cancer. Other women were denied pap smears and mammograms. She met men with untreated HIV. Many more inmates were charged for care they never received.
Then Currie began receiving letters — pleas for help scribbled on notebook paper. Mississippi Today reviewed some of the letters and is protecting the identity of its authors, who shared sensitive details about their medical conditions.

Last fall, Currie met a 69-year-old woman incarcerated at the Mississippi Correctional Institute for Women in Rankin County. The woman said she was having trouble breathing, but couldn’t get prison officials to let her see a doctor. In a letter to Currie months later, the woman said she still hadn’t seen a doctor despite her lips turning purple and blue. She also suffers from gastrointestinal issues that have gone untreated.
“It has affected my eyes, mouth, throat and now my urethra,” she wrote. “I have yet to see a urologist either. I am submitting another sick call to the clinic this week. I don’t know what else to do.”
A 60-year-old woman at the Delta Correctional Facility in Greenwood said she had urinary incontinence, but was denied pads and wipes because facility medical staff, directed by VitalCore, demanded she have a pelvic exam first. She had the exam and was still denied supplies.
“It looks to me like they are setting the criteria too high because at the end of the day, I still have urinary incontinence and am left to fend for myself without means to fend,” the woman wrote. “This is cruel and I am not the only one affected. We are trapped here with no help.” 
The steady stream of letters, each new arrival sounding more desperate than the last, suggested to Currie that the conditions inside Mississippi’s prisons, already condemned by federal officials, were worse than she imagined.

“When people are writing me letters begging me for treatment for health care needs it’s hard for me to just ignore it,” Currie said. “When they need a liver transplant from untreated Hep C or begging me for help with untreated HIV. When they beg me for supplies because they make them reuse colostomy bags over and over that don’t fit, when they are bowel and bladder incontinent and they don’t provide diapers to them it is hard for me to hear that (MDOC) feels that they provide adequate care.”
VitalCore told Mississippi Today it does not deny treatment and provides “comprehensive and competent health care services in accordance with prevailing standards of care.”
Kate Head, the corrections department spokesperson, said the care provided to inmates exceeds “constitutional standards,” and the department “denies any allegation” that inmates receive care below such standards. 
More money, more sickness
Currie was awarded chairmanship of the House Corrections Committee after the 2023 statewide election. She is a conservative Republican with no appetite for the decarceral aspirations of many prison-reform activists.  
With these conservative bona fides in mind, House leadership dispatched Currie to answer a question of government efficiency: Why were Mississippi’s inmates getting sicker even after the state continued increasing its spending on medical care for prisoners? Currie wanted to know why she had been receiving letters from inmates detailing an environment where sick prisoners got sicker even as the state spent more money to treat them.     
In the next fiscal year, Mississippi is set to spend over $121 million on prison medical services, a number that has been climbing for years. But there is little evidence that the money is being spent on providing quality care, Currie said. 
“In my investigations, very little health care is given. We have Hep C and HIV patients dying from no care. We have diabetics who have no possible way of treating their diabetes. High blood pressure inmates who end up on dialysis. Cancer patients are dying from lack of care. So it is obvious to me that this is a game they have played for some time.”
Untreated illness in facilities around the state prompted Currie to author a bill during the 2025 legislative session that would have directed the state Department of Health to conduct a sweeping review of the medical care for inmates at Mississippi prisons.
The legislation passed the House with a large bipartisan majority, but it didn’t survive negotiations with the Senate. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves wanted to hire an out-of-state firm to conduct the review instead of the Department of Health, Currie said.
Months later in the special legislative session for the state budget, the Legislature approved a $690,000 appropriation for MDOC to review its medical services, money that Currie said will go to a private firm. The report will be presented to legislative leaders by Dec. 15.
But Currie said a private out-of-state firm will not be able to infiltrate prisons and identify systemic issues the way a state entity such as the Department of Health could. Plus, it wouldn’t cost the state extra money.
“I am glad the governor is going to look into health care, but it will be a waste of taxpayers’ money not to find out the truth about health care, and the only way to do that is to talk to inmates,” Currie said. “Their problems will not be found in their medical chart.”
A spokesperson for Reeves did not respond to a request for comment. But in a late May press conference announcing the special session, Reeves said he inherited a corrections department that oversaw numerous deaths, and that the department made progress under his watch. He also joked that he would support moving the management of the troubled MDOC to the Lieutenant Governor’s or the House speaker’s office. 
“I made this offer publicly before. I make it privately regularly. I tell my friends in the Lieutenant Governor’s Office and the Speaker’s Office that if they have a problem with something going on at the Department of Corrections, that if they would like to sponsor a bill to move the management of corrections, I’d probably support it.”
Reeves appointed Cain to lead Mississippi’s corrections in 2020. A former warden of the notorious Angola State Prison in Louisiana, Cain’s controversial career has regularly garnered national headlines. He resigned his post in Louisiana in 2015 after allegations that he misused public funds, but he has denied wrongdoing and was later cleared in an investigation conducted by the state’s legislative auditor. 
Pulling the wool over lawmakers’ eyes
The apparent mismatch between increased government spending and stagnant or diminishing health outcomes among prisoners is hidden from public view, some experts say. 
Marcella Alsan and Crystal Yang, professors at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and Harvard Law School, have studied health care delivery in jails. They said the scale of death and sickness inside Mississippi’s prisons may fly under the statistical radar.
“Our research documents significant underreporting of deaths in custody within official statistics,” Alsan and Yang told Mississippi Today. “The issues uncovered within Mississippi prisons reveal poor management and an absence of clear standards of care, much like the jails in our study.” 
Stronger accreditation standards for correctional facilities can help tackle the “inefficiency dilemma” within correctional institutions, the professors said. 
For Currie, the problem lies with a legislative process that has allowed MDOC and VitalCore to use more taxpayer dollars without accounting for how the money is spent. 
“In the rushed special session where we had a self-imposed time limit to vote on a budget, the Department of Corrections and VitalCore pulled the wool over legislators’ eyes,” Currie said. “They act like we are spending more on inmates’ health care and these stupid legislators won’t ask questions. We swap money between health care and MDOC to make sure they get to spend or waste taxpayers’ money, and the Legislature doesn’t ask for any information supporting why they need more money.”
Without improved care and transparency around spending, she warned, prisoners will continue to languish with untreated illnesses with life-altering or fatal consequences. 
Susan Balfour, 63, echoed that sentiment. Balfour was incarcerated for 33 years at Central Mississippi Correctional Facility until her release in December 2021. Balfour said she was among a group of prisoners asked to clean the facility without protective equipment.
She was later diagnosed with terminal breast cancer, a condition that would have been identified earlier had she been provided medical screenings and treatment, according to a lawsuit Balfour filed in federal court.
“They ignored my pleas for help and let my cancer grow untreated for 10 years until it was terminal and too late,” Balfour said. “I never knew when I’d be seen after filing a medical request, and was always at their mercy. It’s like Mississippi is co-signing on their inhumane practices that prioritize corporate profits over people’s lives. Who do these public officials work for? And why are profits protected more than people?”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/17162611/MT-Prison-Health-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2025-06-19 05:59:44.551834

(Photo courtesy of Carnegie Mellon University)Edda Fields-Black was working on a book about rice plantations when she came across the story of a raid in Beaufort that freed more than 700 slaves from Lowcountry plantations.
The Carnegie Mellon University professor decided to pursue the story and, nearly a decade later, published “COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid, and Black Freedom During the Civil War,” which recently won the Pulitzer Prize for history.
Fields-Black first learned about the June 1863 raid reading an account by Minus Hamilton, who was an 88-year-old slave when the daring mission led by Tubman freed him. He told of how three steamships traveled up the river in the dead of night before sounding their whistles, sending slaves working on the neighboring plantations running to the river and to freedom.
Hamilton also talked about his awe at seeing fellow Black men in uniform for the first time, and that image struck Fields-Black.
“I was like, ‘Wow,’ and I tucked it away for a long time,” said Fields-Black, of Pittsburgh.
Fields-Black tried to read more about the raid Hamilton recounted. But she found little beyond mentions here and there in biographies of Tubman, who’s best known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. So, she set out to write the history herself, telling it from the perspective of the raid’s participants and detailing the importance of the rice plantations in pulling it off, she said.
“I wanted to pull out all of those elements, and I thought that I could tell that story,” Fields-Black said.
“COMBEE,” the Gullah pronunciation of the Combahee River, won the prestigious Pulitzer Prize alongside “Native Nations: A Millennium in North American” by Kathleen DuVal in a category that rewards “a distinguished and appropriately documented book on the history of the United States,” according to the Pulitzer website.
The 776-page book told “a richly-textured and revelatory account” of the raid, “weaving military strategy and family history with the transition from bondage to freedom,” the prize’s jury wrote.
Harriet Tubman
Tubman, who became known as the Moses of Her People after escaping slavery herself in 1849, spoke about the Combahee River Raid during her life.
Her role in the raid made her the first woman ever to lead a major military operation in the U.S. and the only Black woman to lead troops during the Civil War. A statue of her unveiled in May 2024 at Beaufort’s Tabernacle Baptist Church commemorates her part in the raid and her years spent in Beaufort.
But historians, lacking official records, rarely delved into the details, Fields-Black said.
When she started telling friends and colleagues about her plans, they similarly insisted there was no way to tell the story from the perspective of enslaved people because no records of the raid existed. But they did exist — just not the kind most researchers rely on, she said.
“There’s a broader question about believing women, believing marginal people and taking our words and our descriptions of our own experiences at face value,” Fields-Black said. “And that hadn’t been done.”
The rice plantations, with their snakes and alligators, made Tubman’s work even more impressive. Other historians had written about the raid as if the environment were the same as in the more northern states where Tubman had worked, but as a researcher of rice fields, Fields-Black knew the specific challenges they presented.
“She could’ve been on the moon, and she would’ve figured out how to survive,” she said.
Finding the story
As she started to research in earnest, Fields-Black knew she couldn’t rely solely on the official military records of the raid, which were written by the Confederate troops controlling Beaufort at the time. Slave narratives from the 1930s mentioned the raid only in passing, and official records in Beaufort and Colleton counties were burned as cities went up in flames during the Civil War, she said.
Fields-Black turned instead to a lesser-used historical resource: pension files. Following the war, soldiers relayed information about themselves and their experiences in an attempt to receive payment from the government.
Among those submitting applications were members of the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, a regiment consisting largely of freed men from the sea islands that drove boats up the Combahee River for enslaved people to board and escape.
Through scouring hundreds of pension files, Fields-Black came across a familiar name.
She had known about a Hector Fields from whom her family descended, but she had thought he lived in nearby Colleton County, not Beaufort. The pension files, however, told the story of Fields as a Civil War veteran who fought in the volunteer infantry, helped free slaves and eventually settled down in Colleton County, she said.
Fields-Black grew up in Florida, but she still has family in that area. Her own father was born in Green Pond, a small town in the same county, and the family’s roots in South Carolina are strong, she said.
The story “has become a source of immense pride in our family,” Fields-Black said.
Even after they were freed, many of the people in the raid returned to Confederate territory, risking their lives and freedom, to help others, she said. The raid itself happened after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had proclaimed all slaves in Southern states to be free.
But in Confederate-controlled areas, that wasn’t put into effect. The nation’s last slaves weren’t freed until two years later, on June 19, 1865, known as Juneteenth.
“It’s the actions of these folks that some would say, and I would agree with them, are even more important than, say, the Emancipation Proclamation in the demise of slavery and ending the institution of slavery,” Fields-Black said.

(Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)With summer officially kicking off on Friday, elected officials and worker advocates are pushing for more state legislation aimed to support people who have to work outside in the hot temperatures.
When a person’s body can’t bring their internal temperature down in these warm climates, it can lead to heat stroke or heat exhaustion. Heat stress is the leading cause of weather-related deaths and can exacerbate underlying illnesses including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health, and asthma, and can increase the risk of accidents and transmission of some infectious diseases, according to the World Health Organization.
“This is an urgent issue because this affects mainly low wage workers who often don’t have a choice but to go to work … under these extreme heat conditions to be able to make a living,” said Ramón Zepeda Ramos, Economic Justice Organizer of Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy.
Currently, there are no federal rules or statewide regulations of when outside workers should be allowed breaks or access to shade and water when temperatures rise. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is beginning public hearings about a rule proposed by former President Joe Biden’s administration that would trigger shade and water access requirements when the heat index reaches 80 degrees. Additionally, it would require 15 minute breaks every two hours when the heat index reaches 90 degrees.
Advocates said even with the OSHA hearing starting this week, the state needs to take action because OSHA can often take years to implement a rule and there is no clear idea if the current administration would implement such a rule. Also, with federal cuts likely to impact the agency, advocates feel it will be unlikely the rule will be put into effect even if it is passed.
“We can’t keep waiting for federal action that may never come. Every worker deserves dignity of safety, access to water, rest, and shade. Also the ability to speak up without fear,” said Manuel Gago, Worker Justice Program Director at the Legal Aid Justice Center.
According to the Virginia Department of Health, since May 1 of this year, over 400 people have been treated for heat-related illness. Heat impacts can often be difficult to identify so it is likely the true scope of patients with heat-related illnesses is underreported.
Two bills were introduced in the 2025 General Assembly session that looked to provide relief to workers who have to be exposed to the elements. House Bill 1980 and Senate Bill 1103, sponsored by Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, and Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, would have allowed workers impacted by the heat to collect damages of $1000, injunctive relief or both. Both bills were left in the Senate Finance Committee.
“It is a simple strategy that has worked for thousands of years across all of nature,”  Hernandez said in a statement. “Our approach to protecting workers is a novel, data driven approach that examines where workers in Virginia are facing the most risk and tailoring the rules to address those areas.”
The New York Times reported that in a Congressional hearing this week, opponents to the new rule claimed it could cause financial havoc on businesses and communities. Seven states have adopted their own heat protection rules for indoor and outdoor workers.

(Photo courtesy of Henrico County Public Schools)After a competitive application process, multiple school divisions and a regional technical center will receive $83.4 million in grants for school construction projects, a move the Virginia Board of Education approved on Wednesday.
A total of $80 million from the fiscal year 2025 application process will be allocated to 10 school divisions, including Lunenburg County for Central High School, the city of Richmond for Woodville Elementary School, and Massanutten Technical Center in Harrisonburg. The Petersburg High School project, which received $13 million towards the project’s $91 million total, was the only project that did not receive full funding.Petersburg missed out on an additional $13 million.
The remaining $3.4 million are reallocated funds collected by the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) because some school divisions canceled their projects in 2022 and 2024. The awards will go to schools in the counties of Pittsylvania and Giles and the city of Richmond.
The canceled projects totaled $8.8 million; $5.3 million of those funds will be transferred to grant processes in fiscal year 2026. 
VDOE said on Wednesday that it decided to carry over the funds because the grant application process for fiscal year 2025 was underway before the state’s budget was finalized.
“All of this work was already completed,” said Christina Berta, VDOE’s chief operating officer. “So, in order to give opportunity to other school divisions that is why we chose to make that decision to marry it with (2026) funding.” 
Applicants have also requested additional training and webinars on applying for construction grants, according to Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson. She said a handful of divisions “thought” they were complying with protocols, but ultimately did not receive funding.
“We’ve been stepping back just to make sure that we are as transparent and clear as possible going into this new fiscal year so that regardless of size or expertise at your division, it’s really clear from the school board member side as well as the leadership side at the division,” Gullickson said.
In 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and lawmakers established the School Construction Assistance Program, which is designed to fund school infrastructure projects.
VDOE reviewed 28 grant applications from 25 divisions and three regional career, technical, and education (CTE) programs to determine the grant recipients. The competitive applicant criteria focused on supporting school boards and regional CTE program governing boards that display “poor building conditions, commitment and need” for funding the construction, expansion, or modernization of public school buildings.
To qualify, schools and regional CTE programs must have projects that lack sufficient funding or financing to cover the full cost of the project, and are either in the local planning phase or already documented in an active local Capital Improvement Plan. 
Applications must also have construction projects that have not started.
Applications are then ​​awarded based on a tiered percentage of approved costs, capped at $100 million. Grant percentages are determined by a school’s local composite index, or a locality’s ability to pay for its own schools by assessing the local tax base.  
Lawmakers, including Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, have backed efforts to direct more funding to school construction projects. One measure that has failed multiple times is a proposal to allow localities to impose a 1% sales tax on school construction. 
Youngkin has vetoed similar measures, including one in March, after citing the state’s existing efforts to fund school construction and concerns over the bill’s impact on taxpayers.
Since 2019, Virginia has allowed nine localities — Charlotte, Gloucester, Halifax, Henry, Mecklenburg, Northampton, Patrick and Pittsylvania counties and the city of Danville — to implement a similar sales tax for school construction funding. Advocates argue it’s time to expand that authority statewide.

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)Cincinnati-based Bon Secours Mercy Health describes itself as a “ministry” that seeks to serve “the poor, dying and underserved.”
However, it’s one of two Ohio “nonprofit” hospital systems to face scrutiny from Congress over the huge amounts it’s raking in from a federal program meant to subsidize care for the poor.
It’s using some of that money to pay lavish salaries and buy stadium-naming rights. Meanwhile, it is reportedly boosting the bottom line by serving wealthy communities and neglecting poorer ones — an outcome that, if true, would directly counter the program’s intent.
In April, the U.S. Senate Health, Labor and Pensions Committee released the results of a years-long investigation it made into a federal program that has exploded over the past 15 years. Among the committee’s concerns was that there appeared to be few — if any — controls on the way hospitals, clinics, and contract pharmacies spend the billions they receive from the program.
And it singled out two Ohio-based hospital chains for special focus — Cleveland Clinic and Bon Secours Mercy Health.
“These hospitals were selected for this investigation as a result of media reports alleging abuse of the 340B Program, such as hospitals cutting services to underserved populations and expanding into affluent areas to increase reimbursement rates and subsequent revenue under the 340B Program,” the committee report said.
The committee’s findings about Cleveland Clinic, which received nearly $1 billion from the program over a 38-month period, are detailed here.

The report focused on Bon Secours Mercy Health because of media reports that it had gained 340B status from a hospital it owns in a poor, Black neighborhood in Richmond, Va. It steadily depleted resources at that hospital, while adding them at facilities in more affluent neighborhoods nearby, the reporting said.
Bon Secours Mercy Health didn’t respond to requests for comment. But observers said such conduct is likely happening elsewhere in the 50-hospital chain.
 Explosive growth

Intended to subsidize care for the needy, the 340B program has grown from $5 billion a year in 2010 to nearly $67 billion in 2023, and analysts say that growth is only accelerating.
The program works by requiring drugmakers to give deep discounts off of list prices for drugs to qualifying hospitals, clinics, and the pharmacies with which they contract. Those entities are then allowed to charge insurers and uninsured customers the full list price and pocket the difference.
The idea behind 340B was to help providers with a large share of uninsured and Medicaid patients make ends meet while they shoulder the cost of uncompensated and under-compensated care.
Cleveland Clinic claimed last month that the program has no impact on taxpayers. But Antonio Ciaccia, a Columbus-based drug-pricing analyst, said the program creates billions in higher costs for insurers and ultimately consumers.
After Congress created the Medicaid Prescription Drug Rebate Program in 1990, it created 340B in 1992, requiring drugmakers to give discounts to qualifying hospitals and clinics that were equal to the Medicaid rebates.
The program grew relatively slowly until passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, when rules changes allowed a lot more entities to qualify. It’s since grown by leaps and bounds and is now the second-largest federal prescription-drug program, behind only Medicare Part D.
Growing numbers of hospital systems have joined the 340B program through seemingly giant loopholes.
Cleveland Clinic, for example, doesn’t admit enough Medicaid and uninsured patients to qualify under the original 340B rules. But under a quirk in the new rules, it was allowed in as a “rural-referral center” even though it’s headquartered in the middle of a big city.
Rural referral centers have lower barriers to qualify and are the fastest-growing type of 340B hospitals. Possibly indicating abuse, by 2022, 82% of so-called “rural referral centers” were located in urban areas, as were 77% of their patients, according to the Berkeley Research Group, a consulting firm.
 Intended outcome?

Facilities owned by another Ohio-based group — Bon Secours Mercy Health — qualified another way. Its Richmond Community Hospital in Virginia is located in a low-income Black neighborhood in the city’s East End, where it qualifies as a federal “disproportionate share” hospital and thus for the 340B program.
However, the New York Times reported in 2022 Bon Secours Mercy Health hollowed out Richmond Community, closing its intensive care unit, its maternity ward, and other vital departments.
At the same time, it created legal connections between the hospital and other clinics it owned in wealthier parts of town so that they could get 340B drug discounts. In those facilities it could reap a greater percentage of the 340B benefit because more patients are privately insured. That’s because transactions involving Medicaid patients aren’t eligible for the discount.
The paper reported on the perverse outcome of Bon Secours Mercy Health’s practices: It stripped its hospital in a poor neighborhood of resources while it used money meant for it to build and renovate lavish facilities where few poor people went.
“Bon Secours was basically laundering money through this poor hospital to its wealthy outposts,” Dr. Lucas English, who worked at Richmond Community until 2018, told the Times. “It was all about profits.”
For participating hospitals, the profits can be huge.
Bon Secours Mercy Health collected $276 million in 340B benefits over a five-year period that ended in 2023, the Senate committee reported. That was just for the facilities that participate in 340B under Richmond Community’s designation — not those connected to any of the chain’s dozens of other hospitals that might separately be part of the 340B program.
 Questionable spending

Some critics who want to see reform say there must be greater controls over how money collected under the program is spent. As it is, there don’t appear to be any.
Bon Secours Mercy Health and Cleveland Clinic told Senate investigators that they simply put the money into their general revenue and don’t specifically account for it after that.
As tens of billions more flow each year into hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies that participate in 340B, some are accused of spending on things that have nothing to do with health care — much less health care for the poor.
Bon Secours and Cigna reach agreement, keeping 30,000 Virginians in-network

For example, how much New York University’s Langone Hospitals receive from the 340B program is not publicly available, but the number surely isn’t small. The system raised eyebrows when it spent an estimated $8 million advertising itself during the Super Bowl.
Bon Secours paid more than $4 million for the naming rights of a Greenville, S.C. sports arena, claiming it would produce better health outcomes for the community.
“We’ve truly used this collaboration to expand our reach beyond hospital walls and live out our mission of building healthier communities, which is why we are very excited to extend this partnership and continue working together to make a difference in our community for many years to come,” Mark Caldwell, an executive with the 340B hospital, said in a written statement.
How the community would be made healthier by the arena’s food and beverage offerings isn’t obvious.
“The arena proudly offers Carolina Smoke BBQ, Well Pressed and Swamp Dog food stands, Reedy River Roost (our in house fried chicken shop!), GVL Pizza, Moe’s Southwest Grill, Pepsi products, and a nice selection of craft beer, domestic beer, and wine,” says the arena’s website, which has a picture of a bartender pouring gin into a cup.
Mercy Health also held the naming rights to the Lake Erie Crushers baseball stadium in Avon, Ohio, until last year. Mercy Health Lorain Hospital, 12 miles away, is a 340B facility.
 Community benefit

Nonprofit hospitals receiving huge amounts from 340B aren’t just facing questions about whether they’re using those funds in the best interest of the poor and uninsured. Nonprofit hospitals generally have been coming under fire as analyses have shown that most are not providing community services that are commensurate with the huge tax breaks they enjoy.
Theoretically, institutions are given tax exemptions in exchange for providing community benefits, but in Ohio most nonprofit hospitals receive more than they give, according to a recent analysis.
The nonpartisan Lown Institute this year reported that Ohio’s nonprofit hospitals get $2.2 billion annually in tax breaks. Yet nearly three quarters (74%) of them provide less than that in community service, the report said.
That creates a $1.3 billion annual “fair share” deficit — the second-highest of the 20 states studied, the report said. Cleveland Clinic was the biggest offender in the state, with a $207 million annual deficit. That also qualified as the fifth-highest among any hospital in the 20 states, the report said.
Some of these “nonprofit” hospitals are also paying their top brass huge salaries. In the case of Bon Secours Mercy Health, CEO John Starcher Jr. made $8.8 million in reportable compensation in 2023 and an estimated $3.5 million more in “other compensation from the organization and related organizations,” the nonprofit’s IRS Form 990 says. The resulting $12.3 million is 176 times the median household income in Ohio.
The Economic Research Institute in 2022 put Starcher among the 10 highest-paid nonprofit CEOs in the country. The average nonprofit CEO made much less — just $152,199, the report said.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Cities lead bans on algorithmic rent hikes as states lag behind

Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Stockton wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” he wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

(Photo courtesy African American Library at The Gregory School, Houston Public Library)The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
‘All slaves are free’
Juneteenth — short for June Nineteenth — recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”
Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted, “Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
‘Second Independence Day’
June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

Legacies of slavery
While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”

National recognition
Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”
Backtracking on gains
But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

An advocacy group is trying to pressure the state’s Republican U.S. senators to vote against it.
Republican lawmakers in D.C. and Columbus are hashing out budgets. As they do, they’re looking for ways to cut spending to finance tax cuts weighted heavily toward the wealthy.
The reconciliation bill — President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” — passed by the U.S. House of Representatives would provide about would cut taxes by more than $3 trillion and give 70% of the money to the richest 10% according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 
At the state level, Policy Matters Ohio said that a flat-tax proposal passed by the Ohio Senate would cost the state $1.1 billion a year and give 96% of the benefit to the state’s top 20% of income earners.
Some Republicans at both levels also have plans to make deep cuts to the social safety net.
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute last week published an issue brief saying that cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplace would result in a $1 trillion loss in health spending for poor and working people. Ohio alone would lose $31 billion as part of that, the analysis said. 
The Medicaid cuts would cost Ohio’s hospitals $9.5 billion — and they’d have to shoulder more uncompensated care as more Ohioans would become uninsured. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would create 16 million more uninsured Americans by 2034.
Study: Ohio among hardest hit if Congress, Trump cut Medicaid

“The Medicaid cuts Congress is considering would be the largest funding reduction in the program’s history, and it is hard to overstate just how devastating the impacts would be,” Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said in a written statement. “Such drastic changes to Medicaid financing would have ripple effects that go well beyond people covered by the program, further squeezing hospitals, limiting access to care for entire communities, and destabilizing state and local economies.”
Significant federal funding cuts to Medicaid would be particularly hard on Ohioans. Gov. Mike DeWine’s proposed budget has a provision that would end the state’s 11-year-old Medicaid expansion. That would cost 770,000 Ohioans — most of whom are working — their health coverage.
The Commonwealth Fund in May said the Buckeye State would be one of the five hardest hit by the proposed cuts. And they would come at a critical time, the organization said in a report released Wednesday. 
Ohio ranked 30th overall for health system performance. It scored particularly badly in terms of infant mortality, preventable hospitalizations, and mortality disparities between Black and other Ohioans.
Not only would Republican spending proposals slash health funding for lower-income Americans, it would decimate food assistance for the poorest. 
“The House-passed Republican reconciliation plan would cut nearly $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) through 2034, based on Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates — by far the largest cut to SNAP in history,” the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote in May. 
“As a result of these cuts and other policies in the legislation — which are being used to pay partly for trillions in tax cuts skewed to the wealthy — millions of people would lose some or all of the food assistance they need to afford groceries, when many low-income households are struggling to afford the high cost of food and other basic needs.” 
If those proposed cuts become reality, Ohio’s foodbanks won’t able to ameliorate the hunger they create, the executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks said earlier this month.

Tax cuts weighted toward the wealthiest and cuts in benefits to the most vulnerable have the group Families Over Billionaires trying to put pressure on Republican senators to vote no on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. As part of a seven-state, $5 million buy, a commercial went up in Ohio this week.
“We sent Senators (Bernie) Moreno and (Jon) Husted to Washington to lower costs,” the narrator says. “So now that they’re in charge, what are they doing about it? They’re kicking 16 million people off of health care, taking food from 18 million kids, and driving costs through the roof for 80 million families. All to give the super-rich a $250,000 tax cut while your costs go up. They pay less and you pay more. That’s the billionaire tax scam. Tell your senators to vote no.”
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 16 million would lose health coverage under the Republican plan. The Urban Institute estimates that 18.3 million children would lose food assistance. Economists widely expect Trump’s tariffs — taxes on imports — to cause significant inflation. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the 1% of wealthiest households would get an average annual tax cut of $250,000.

Kelly Ayotte, banning cell phone use in schools has been a day one priority. “Screens are negatively impacting our learning environments, drawing students’ attention away from their classes, and becoming a barrier for teachers to do their jobs,” she told lawmakers during her inaugural address in January. “No more.”  It’s an idea that […]","New Hampshire lawmakers have until 4 p.m. Thursday to craft a final deal on a school phone ban. (Getty Images)For Gov. Kelly Ayotte, banning cell phone use in schools has been a day one priority.
“Screens are negatively impacting our learning environments, drawing students’ attention away from their classes, and becoming a barrier for teachers to do their jobs,” she told lawmakers during her inaugural address in January. “No more.” 
It’s an idea that has gained traction across the country recently in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a wave of learning loss and socialization issues in schools, and a broader push to reduce children’s screen time. And for a while, it appeared that Ayotte’s desired ban might sail through the Legislature.
But in the final days of the 2025 legislative session, the Senate and House are facing disagreements over how the state should best do that.
On one side is the House’s proposal to require school districts to adopt policies banning the use of cell phones for the entire duration of the school day, a policy known as “bell to bell.”
That version, attached as an amendment to Senate Bill 206, is closest to what the governor suggested in her budget proposal back in February, although the House took out the $1 million in state grant funding Ayotte had devoted to help schools buy materials to implement the policy. 
On the other side is the Senate’s suggestion: to require school boards to adopt cell phone restriction policies, but to give them the freedom to craft one of their choosing.
Lawmakers have until 4 p.m. Thursday to craft a final deal, and Ayotte has sought to increase the pressure to approve the House’s more prescriptive approach.
On Tuesday morning, the governor’s office released a statement from author Jonathan Haidt that praised the House’s version of the law. Haidt, a social psychologist, wrote the 2024 book “The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness,” and has been credited with inspiring other states’ cell phone ban legislation.
“I am thrilled to see New Hampshire taking amongst the strongest efforts in the nation to protect our children’s futures in considering NH SB 206,” Haidt said in the statement. “New Hampshire’s policy mandating bell-to-bell device separation will help bring conversation and laughter back to the hallways of schools across the state.”
Haidt and others argue the proliferation of smart phones has increased mental health problems among adolescents, stunted their social and emotional development, and created deep distractions in the classroom that have contributed to lower proficiency scores measured in tests such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
As of May, 26 states have passed laws regulating cell phone usage in schools, and 17 of them did so in 2025, according to the Associated Press. Ten of those states have passed bell-to-bell bans for the entire school day; others include midday breaks or other exceptions. 
In New Hampshire, few lawmakers dispute that action over cell phones is needed. But some in the Senate say school districts should have flexibility over how to craft their policies, and should do so with input from their constituent parents.
“It’s limiting the use of cell phones, and it’s giving tools to the districts to do so,” said Sen. Donovan Fenton, a Keene Democrat, in an interview. “Some schools ban it completely. Some schools say, ‘No, you have to talk to the principal or your teacher.’ Some schools have zones where … (students) can check their cell phones. I think it’s up to the districts to decide that.” 
The original Senate bill would have required school districts to craft “a policy for personal device use by students during the school day and be implemented school-wide, with approved exceptions determined by student medical, disability, or language proficiency need.” The policy would have to be created in collaboration with teachers and parents, the Senate bill states.
The House attached an amendment that would also require collaboration with teachers and parents. But the House amendment states that the policy “shall prohibit all personal communication device use by students from when the first bell rings to start instructional time until the dismissal bell rings to end the academic school day, with approved exceptions determined by the superintendent or their designee with respect to student medical, disability, or language proficiency need.”
Rep. Glenn Cordelli, a Tuftonboro Republican and the chairman of the Education Policy and Administration Committee, says the Legislature should be more decisive and give districts little wiggle room.
“We think that with all the discussion about mental health in the schools and anxiety, depression and issues about screen time, that there has to be a bell-to-bell policy in the schools in the state,” Cordelli said in an interview, speaking for himself and fellow House negotiators. “We can’t have one policy in one district and one policy in another district.”
Fenton disagrees, arguing that a top-down state mandate would prevent schools from developing policies with reasonable exceptions and accommodations. The House’s amendment would exempt the cell phone ban from applying to “students with medical needs, such as insulin pumps and glucose sensors, or disabilities from using a device to support their learning as identified by their individualized education program.”
“I think the governor is too willing to go to the extreme too fast,” he said. 
As a father of a child entering first grade, Fenton said he supports limits on cell phone use, but would worry if his son had no access to his phone throughout the day when he’s older.
“I think it makes you far more nervous if you can’t reach your child,” he said. 
The New Hampshire School Boards Association has joined the call for a state law limiting cell phone use, but it has not taken a position on whether the House or Senate version is ideal.
To Barrett Christina, the president of the association, a state law could help school teachers, administrators, and school board members enforce a cell phone ban without taking as much heat from students and parents.
“We support the general policy of having restrictions in law relative to cell phone use or personal electronic communication devices if for no other reason than it gives school districts some cover to point to the law, when getting parents to come around on the issue,” Christina said. 
And Christina added that whatever law gets passed — whether the flexible or the rigid version — school boards and school district officials will need to proceed with as much interaction and consultation with parents as possible.
“The biggest issue, whatever comes out of this, is going to be the parental buy-in and educating and teaching to parents about what the policy says — why it’s being implemented,” he said. “… We certainly understand and respect the needs and desires of parents and children to communicate among the family from time to time for a variety of reasons.” 
For her part, Ayotte has been clear that a more aggressive policy is needed. “We have the opportunity to make our schools an even better place to learn, and I urge the Legislature to meet the moment and pass a bell-to-bell ban on cell phones in schools,” she said in a statement Monday. 
A final resolution is expected Thursday, when House and Senate negotiators will meet again at 2 p.m. in State House Room 100 to work on a final agreement. Fenton predicted Ayotte would use the time to try to convince senators that her approach is better.
“The governor’s going very heavy-handed into this,” Fenton said. “And I think there are some people on both sides of the aisle that don’t agree.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/phonesstudent-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-19 05:59:44.551834

And at such a moment, it’s imperative that all Americans – and especially our elected leaders – disavow violence or even the appearance of endorsing it.
And it’s in light of this that Wake County State Rep. Julie von Haefen was clearly in error recently for briefly posting an image on social media of a protester’s sign that portrayed a guillotine and a head resembling President Trump.
To her credit, though, von Haefen quickly realized her mistake, took down the image, and publicly apologized. Would that the conservative politicians attacking her in the aftermath of the incident would do likewise.
Indeed, that should start with Trump himself, who both as a candidate and president, has made violent imagery and threats targeting his opponents a central part of his speeches for years.
The bottom line: Emotions can run high in politics and sometimes people get carried away. Rep. von Haefen learned this lesson the hard way. Her honest admission and pledge to do better should inspire leaders of all parties to follow suit.

State Reps. Dontavius Jarrells, D-Columbus, and Veronica Sims, D-Akron, are working on a joint resolution that would remove slavery from the state’s foundational document.
“This isn’t political,” Jarrells said Wednesday during an Ohio Legislative Black Caucus press conference. “This isn’t personal. This is a moral overdue journey to change our constitution once and for all. Other states have already done it. We simply want Ohio to live up to this promise of freedom.”

The 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for being convicted of a crime. The Ohio Constitution currently says “There shall be no slavery in this state; nor involuntary servitude, unless for the punishment of crime.” 
Seven states have removed the slavery loophole from their constitution — Alabama, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Utah, Colorado, and Nebraska, according to the Abolish Slavery National Network. 
“I submit that slavery and or involuntary servitude in any shape, form or fashion, should be disembodied from the sacred pages of the founding document of our great state,” Sims said. “It is time to remove any exception under any circumstances, slavery is a vile, despicable imposition upon another human being.”
This is not the first time there have been legislative attempts in Ohio to remove slavery from the state’s constitution. Jarrells had a bipartisan joint resolution that was unable to get out of committee during the last General Assembly. A Senate Joint Resolution was also unsuccessful back in 2020. 
If the House and Senate pass the new joint resolution, it would go to the statewide ballot for the voters to decide. 
Wednesday’s press conference was hosted by members of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus in honor of Juneteenth, a federal holiday Thursday remembering the end of slavery in the United States on June 19, 1865 — two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. 
“Juneteenth signifies the end of slavery, and it’s a time to celebrate,” said State Rep. Terrence Upchurch, D-Cleveland. “Although we are proud of the progress we have made, that does not negate the fact that there are still several challenges Black Ohioans face across the state. People are still struggling with finding housing, healthy foods, good paying jobs, satisfactory education, fair treatment in the justice system, and so much more.” 
Jarrells introduced House Bill 306 last month, also known as the Enact the Hate Crime Act. 
“It empowers victims with real civil remedies and gives law enforcement clear, enforceable tools to hold perpetrators accountable,” he said. “This bill says that every single person in this state deserves to live without fear, and if you are targeted for who you are, this state will stand with you.”
State Rep. Darnell T. Brewer, D-Cleveland, talked about recent gun legislation he is working on. 
“Gun violence is devastating our communities,” he said. “We can no longer afford to be silent or inactive.”
Black youth are 11 times more likely to die from firearm homicide than their white peers, according to Brady: United Against Gun Violence. 
Brewer said he plans on introducing a resolution to encourage responsible gun ownership by promoting safe storage practices to prevent children from accessing guns and a resolution on safe firearm storage education. 
“Gun violence is not just an emergency,” he said. “It’s a daily reality.”
Infant mortality, when a child dies before their first birthday, is higher for Black babies compared to white babies. The national infant mortality rate is 5.5 per 1,000 live births for babies and 10.9 for Black babies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The infant mortality rate for Ohio Black babies in 2022 was 13.4 per 1,000 live births.
“Why do we stop caring about babies after they’re born?” State Rep. Derrick Hall, D-Akron, asked.
State Rep. Ismail Mohamed, D-Columbus, talked about House Bill 281, a bill that would withhold Medicaid funding from hospitals that do not cooperate with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. State Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., introduced the bill last month. 
“What this bill does is essentially force medical providers to choose between honoring your oath as medical providers or complying with the state’s political agenda,” Mohamed said. “It will discourage immigrant communities from seeking life saving treatment care out of fear.” 
Mohamed also talked about House Bill 1, a piece of legislation that would place restrictions on foreign ownership of land. State Reps. Angie King, R-Celina, and Roy Klopfenstein, R-Haviland, introduced the bill earlier this year. 
“It is arbitrary,” Mohamed said. “It is discriminatory in its face, and will negatively impact economic development in the state of Ohio.”

The intricate circuitry and components highlight the precision and complexity of modern technology, ideal for electronics and artificial intelligence.Ohio Senators saw the first pushback on a proposal establishing new rules restricting the use of artificial intelligence to create pornography, particularly images depicting minors. An organization made up of tech company leaders argue the bill’s intent is good, but they worry it could hamper their business.
The proposal and the opponent
Senate Bill 163 updates state obscenity laws to include an “artificially generated depiction.” The sponsors argue bad actors could evade prosecution for child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, if the images in their possession are made with AI.
Notably, the bill restricts this definition to depictions of an actual person. In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down as over broad a law prohibiting what “appears to be” obscene images of minors.
In addition to prohibiting AI-produced porn involving minors, the bill also bars several uses of AI to conduct identity fraud. That includes using deepfake porn as well as any other depiction intended to harm another person’s reputation. But it goes further — extending to fabricating a person’s image or voice to elicit a financial decision, for instance.
The group TechNet is made up of executives in the tech industry including several companies deeply invested in artificial intelligence. The organization didn’t send a representative to testify against the bill in person, but it did submit several objections to the measure as written.
The broad contours are familiar to many recent debates about emerging technology: don’t hold us liable for our users’ actions and don’t dictate our response to rapidly changing technology.
Backers urge Ohio lawmakers to pass AI restrictions

TechNet’s critique
TechNet was at pains to insist it supports lawmakers’ efforts to respond to fabricated imagery.
“We appreciate the committee’s efforts to address the challenges posed by deceptive media and believe that it is crucial to establish clear standards and protections in this evolving landscape — especially given the absence of federal law,” its testimony read.
As initially drafted, the Senate bill required a watermark on artificially generated media. TechNet argued tools for determining “content provenance” are good but objected the bill’s approach.
“Standardized, industrywide specifications are still emerging,” TechNet argued, “and it is important Ohio maintains a flexible approach that can align with best practice.”
Watermarks are “rigid” and “easily removed” the group insisted — putting markers in metadata makes more sense. Wednesday, the bill’s co-sponsor, state Sen. Louis Blessing, R-Colerain Twp., amended the measure. The change redefines watermark as “data embedded within an AI-generated product.” The amendment also clarified the bill is focused on generative AI.
When it comes to distribution of CSAM, the group argued its members are already working with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. The group wants to ensure those efforts don’t “erroneously lead to liability.”
“We also recommend language making clear that liability should be squarely on the bad actor: the person creating, viewing, promoting, or distributing CSAM,” the group wrote.
As for broader protections of a person’s likeness, TechNet sought to distance its members from culpability. It depicted its members as “intermediaries” who “cannot see the content traversing over their networks and platforms.”
TechNet also pushed back forcefully on allowing anyone to file lawsuits for violations. That provision, “can lead to a flood of opportunistic lawsuits that burden courts, create legal uncertainty, and stifle innovation,” the group argued. Instead, the “sole enforcement” authority should rest with the Attorney General.
Where things stand
Although his amendment seems to push the bill closer to TechNet’s metadata suggestion, Blessing said he doesn’t believe it would bring the organization on board. He expressed frustration with the group’s opposition to allowing anyone to file a lawsuit. Unsurprisingly, Blessing said, there’s strong support within his party’s caucus to go after child pornography and identity fraud.
But if the provision allowing private lawsuits gets removed, “in a very large way, it guts the bill,” he argued.
“I have seen this time and time again in other states, in other bills,” Blessing said. “If you can sort of create a bottleneck in the AG’s office, you now have basically regulatory capture.”
“All the AG’s office has to do to help TechNet is to literally do nothing,” he added.

(Getty Images)In September 1864, in the midst of the Civil War, something remarkable happened in Leavenworth.
A group of Jewish residents — many of them immigrants — gathered with Col. Champion Vaughan of the 4th Kansas Cavalry and Christian community leaders, including pastors and judges, to dedicate the first synagogue in Kansas. They toasted religious liberty, trial by jury and President Abraham Lincoln, who had less than two years earlier issued the Emancipation Proclamation. One speaker declared that the Jewish people across the world would “hold him in grateful remembrance for all time.”
Today, the congregation no longer exists. The former synagogue, B’nai Jeshurun, was sold and converted into apartments in 1974. Its founding date is often misremembered — even on the historical marker — as having taken place in 1866. But newspaper archives confirm the dedication occurred two years earlier, in September 1864.
That error may explain why the true story of this groundbreaking Kansas congregation, and the spirited public debate it sparked, has remained hidden for so long.
The story began not just with goodwill, but with a controversy. In June 1864, a Methodist minister in Leavenworth, Rev. Daniel P. Mitchell, criticized local Christians who had donated to support the construction of a Jewish house of worship. He claimed from the pulpit — and later in a published letter titled “A Hebrew on the Hebrews” — that no Christian could morally support what he considered a false religion.
Judaism, in his view, was a “bad moral cause,” comparable to a stillhouse or gambling hall. He argued that generosity, if not tied to promoting Christ, was meaningless.
His remarks prompted a powerful public reply in the Leavenworth Bulletin, signed only “HEBREW.” The Jewish writer accused the minister of sectarian bigotry and defended the growing synagogue as a place that would provide education, reduce vice, and inspire civic virtue.
He challenged the pastor directly: “We don’t think as Mr. M. thinks — so we are morally wrong.” He then called for charity, pluralism, and the freedom of conscience guaranteed in a democratic society. “Any true Christian,” he wrote, “will feel glad to see his fellow citizens enabled to worship God according to the dictates of their conscience.”
The writer also asserted that actions — not creeds — should define moral character. Quoting, “By their fruits shall ye know them,” he offered to publicly defend Judaism against the minister’s attacks and framed the synagogue as a moral anchor for a frontier town, not a threat.
When the dedication finally came in September, it was not a quiet or defensive affair. The synagogue’s founding celebration lasted into the night, complete with music, speeches, and dinner. The published list of toasts offers a rare glimpse into the spirit of the moment. One toast honored “our friends who have nobly assisted us in our work,” another celebrated the virtue of charity and another still praised “The mothers and daughters of Israel.”
Vaughan toasted the free press. And Henry Sykes, a member of B’nai Jeshurun, responding to a toast to “The President,” honored Lincoln as a liberator. “The Jewish people,” he said, “would hold him in grateful remembrance for all time” for his Emancipation Proclamation.
This was a moment of convergence: Jewish and Christian, immigrant and citizen, sacred and civic. In the middle of the most brutal war in our country’s history, Kansans came together to bless a building — and in doing so, to bless the fragile pluralism of American democracy.
That building no longer functions as a house of prayer. In April 1974, just months before its closure, the congregation welcomed a group, United Methodist Women, for a synagogue tour. Still, B’nai Jeshurun was a place of hospitality and interfaith friendship. The spirit of that 1864 gathering still speaks.
The Jewish writer who sparred with Mitchell never signed his full name. He did not seek credit or praise. What he wanted — what he insisted on — was dignity. The dignity to worship freely. The dignity to be seen as a moral equal. The dignity of belonging, not just in faith, but in Kansas civic life.
Today, as Jewish institutions face rising threats and other faith communities worry about their place in public life, the story of B’nai Jeshurun’s founding is more than a historical footnote. It is a reminder that religious freedom is not just a constitutional ideal. It is a lived tradition: sometimes fragile, sometimes challenged, but always worth defending.
In 1864, Kansas didn’t just tolerate its Jewish community. It toasted it.
Let’s remember it.

The United States’ newest federal holiday, celebrated annually on June 19, has quickly become its most puzzling one. Four years after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Americans have wrestled with what to make of the holiday.
What is Juneteenth? What is the proper way to celebrate it? Should holiday observers attend barbecues and cookouts? Should Juneteenth’s observance be a day of learning? Is there a way to acknowledge the holiday without misappropriating it?
This confusion likely emerged because many Americans did not even learn about Juneteenth until around when it became a federal holiday in 2021. Moreover, the Trump administration and state legislatures across the country have further complicated matters with their increased efforts to ban the type of education that led to the national recognition of the holiday in the first place.
 ‘All slaves are free’

Juneteenth – short for June Nineteenth – recognizes the day in 1865 when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with roughly 2,000 federal troops from the 13th Army Corps. Upon arriving, Granger issued General Order No. 3. The order read:
“The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.”

  The official handwritten record of General Order No. 3, preserved at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. (Photos from the National Archives.)
Granger’s order effectively freed 250,000 enslaved people in the region.
Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the enslaved in all the states that had seceded from the U.S., nearly 2½ years earlier, Texas, a Confederate state, rebelled against it.
At the time, Texas had a minimal number of Union soldiers to enforce the proclamation’s emancipation of enslaved people residing within Confederate territory. Consequently, many of those enslaved in Texas remained ignorant of the proclamation’s potential impact on their lives, or of the fact the Civil War had functionally ended two months earlier.
In an interview published in 1941, for example, Laura Smalley of Hempstead, Texas, remembered how her enslaver fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. He returned without informing those whom he enslaved of their freedom. In her interview, she recounted,
“Old master didn’t tell, you know, they was free … I think now they say they worked them, six months after that.”
 ‘Second Independence Day’

June 19, 1865, a Monday, changed that.
The news of emancipation culminated a generations-long struggle for Black people to obtain a modicum of freedom in the U.S.
For this reason, some refer to Juneteenth as the nation’s second Independence Day. The end of bondage was ostensibly codified in the 13th Amendment ratified later that year.
Spontaneous Juneteenth celebrations emerged almost immediately. Celebrants referred to the day as “Emancipation Day,” “Freedom Day,” “Juneteenth” and “Jubilee Day.” The latter title alluded to the biblical period following seven sabbatical cycles that resulted in canceling debts and freeing the enslaved.
Flake’s Bulletin, a weekly, Galveston-based publication, reported on an Emancipation Celebration occurring on Jan. 2, 1866, that included upward of 800 people. A similar gathering occurred in Galveston on June 19, 1866, in what is now the church known as Reedy Chapel AME. Annual celebrations continued, beginning in southeastern Texas, with events such as historical reenactments, parades, picnics, music and speeches.

 Legacies of slavery

While the holiday marked a joyous occasion for some, Juneteenth met early and persistent opposition, particularly in the time following Reconstruction.
For years, local reporting spoke of Juneteenth, as the Galveston Historical Foundation put it, in a “flagrantly racist nature.” Additionally, the racist stereotyping – “idleness” – in the final sentence of Granger’s order simultaneously illustrated its complicated nature while also “[foreshadowing] that the fight for freedom would continue,” National Archives staffer Michael Davis wrote in 2020.
Historian Keisha Blain explains, “The enslavement of Black people in the U.S. may have ended but the legacies of slavery still shape every aspect of Black life.”
Advocates such as Opal Lee, commonly referred to as the “grandmother of Juneteenth,” pressed for Juneteenth celebration to continue and, ultimately, for it to be made a national holiday.
Lee began her advocacy in earnest during the mid-1970s in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. The oldest member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation, Lee spearheaded several campaigns to draw attention to Juneteenth. These campaigns included initiatives such as an online petition promoting the holiday’s observance launched in 2019 that amassed 1.6 million signatures.
In speaking on the significance of Juneteenth, Lee said, “Freedom is for everyone. I think freedom should be celebrated from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July; however, none of us are free until we are all free. We are not free yet, and Juneteenth is a symbol of that.”
 National recognition

Because of this advocacy, Juneteenth has grown from relatively obscure regional celebrations to, starting in 2021, a federal holiday.
The establishment of the holiday was the capstone of initiatives during the racial reckoning. Historians refer to the racial reckoning as the time period beginning in the summer of 2020 until the spring of the following year that witnessed heightened attention to America’s nagging history of racism.
This reckoning included the historic protests prompted by the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery.
During this time, numerous institutions, ranging from colleges and universities to major companies, made commitments to racial equity. The recognition of Juneteenth represented a symbolic means to honor those commitments.
In remarks marking his signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, Biden said, “Juneteenth marks both the long, hard night of slavery and subjugation, and a promise of a brighter morning to come.”
 Backtracking on gains

But within a year, some had already begun to argue the nation had, as community organizer Braxton Brewington wrote, “betrayed the spirit of Jubilee Day.”
Many of the racial equity commitments made during the racial reckoning quickly vanished within a year or two. Economist William Michael Cunningham revealed American companies pledged $50 billion to racial equity efforts in 2020, yet had only spent $250 million by 2021.
By the spring of 2025, companies such as Walmart and McDonald’s announced they will discontinue their diversity, equity and inclusion work. Moreover, Walmart will stop using the term altogether. Amazon, Meta and dozens of other large corporations made similar announcements.
And members of the Trump administration have mounted continual attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and used the term as a politically expedient slur to deride Black people. This is also exacerbated by the Trump administration’s challenges to birthright citizenship, a key right that gave citizenship to the formerly enslaved and later guaranteed important rights to the entire populace.
This major shift has fueled arguments that the U.S. has regressed from efforts toward racial equity and thus undermined the meaning of Juneteenth. And such backtracking arguably makes some Juneteenth celebrations performative exercises rather than celebrations of true racial equity.
As one critic asked, has the holiday devolved “into an exploitative and profit-driven enterprise for companies that disregard the true significance of this day to the Black community?”
All of this has led to increasing confusion over how to commemorate Juneteenth, if at all. Juneteenth is not the first federal holiday with a complicated history. Nevertheless, with other complex holidays, Americans had years to process their misgivings. In short, the nation is still deciding what it means to be free.

While on her way home from a coworking space in Denver last year, Colorado state Rep. Jenny Willford says she was sexually assaulted by her Lyft driver.
In her lawsuit filed against Lyft in January, Willford alleges she was “subjected to unwelcome, nonconsensual sexual contact, touching” and lewd comments during the ride.
Willford was picked up by a different driver than the person identified in the Lyft app, according to the suit.
Her experience — and those that other survivors shared with her after hearing her story — prompted Willford, a Democrat, to introduce legislation this year that aimed to require safety measures for both riders and drivers using ridesharing apps.
“In my mind, all of these things are very basic when it comes to safety,” Willford said. “They’re just so common sense that it’s been really disheartening and frustrating to me that Uber … threatened to leave the state if the bill becomes law.”
Her bill would have required rideshare companies to conduct more regular background checks for drivers, to create a program for passengers or drivers who want to audio or video record their rides and to develop other safety policies.
But following Uber’s threats to leave the state if the measure passed, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it in late May. The bill would jeopardize rideshare services in Colorado “to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers,” his veto letter said.
Colorado isn’t alone. State and city leaders across the country are looking for ways to make rideshares safer. But lobbying campaigns from Uber and Lyft in many cases are blocking legislation meant to strengthen protections for both drivers and passengers.
Rideshare drivers win more benefits, protections despite industry pushback

Uber and Lyft, the two companies that dominate the U.S. rideshare industry, argue they have sufficient safety features within their apps.
“At Uber, we put safety at the heart of our operations, using technology, transparency, and accountability to help protect riders, drivers, and the broader community, with robust background checks and safety features like Audio and Video Recording, the Emergency Button, PIN verification, and RideCheck,” Uber wrote in a statement to Stateline.
“We remain committed to this work, and to dialogue with bill sponsors on sensible policies that keep people safe while protecting privacy and access.”
But there’s still a gap in regulations for rideshare companies because of their evolving technologies, said Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy, a left-leaning anti-poverty advocacy organization.
“Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers —that sort of work is relatively new, so there’s not a clear standard,” Roque said.
Uber and Lyft are employing lobbyists at the state and local levels. In Rhode Island, another state where legislators are pushing rideshare safety bills that the companies have objected to, Uber is on pace to spend $50,000 this year on lobbyists, according to the state’s lobbying database. Lyft has been spending $5,000 monthly on lobbyists in Rhode Island.

Across the country, Uber and Lyft have testified against measures in state legislative hearings and city council meetings. In Colorado’s case, a number of officials representing Uber spoke out against Willford’s legislation at committee hearings, while Lyft sent a letter to Gov. Polis urging him to veto it. Jerry Golden, Lyft’s chief policy officer, wrote in the letter that the legislation’s requirements “ignore and ultimately will not improve conditions for riders and drivers.”
Uber told the state Senate it would be “impossible” for rideshare companies to comply with the bill’s requirements immediately upon approval and that the  audio and video requirement is “not possible to enforce.”
“The intention of my legislation was never to drive out Uber or Lyft,” Willford said. “The intention was always to require a higher level of accountability and safety from them. But we can’t do that if they’re going to throw tantrums and pick up their toys and go home every time somebody asks them to do better.”
 Safety for passengers

As a part of Lyft’s safety measures, drivers must complete annual background checks and mandatory driver safety education. The app is also programmed to check in with riders when drivers take long stops or deviate from the route they were assigned.
Uber conducts periodic criminal screenings for all active drivers and requires drivers to regularly verify their identity by sharing a selfie with Uber using the app. Both companies offer live emergency assistance to riders.
Between 2020 and 2022, Lyft reported 23 fatal physical assaults of people using the Lyft platform and 2,651 instances of the five most serious categories of sexual assault, according to its 2024 Safety Transparency Report. While incidents of sexual assault had decreased 21% since the last report, which covered 2017-2019, fatal physical assaults jumped by 185%.
Uber saw 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022 and 2,717 incidents of the most serious categories of sexual assault, according to the company’s most recent safety report. Despite a 22% decline in sexual assault and misconduct, there was an increase in fatal physical assaults since its 2019-2020 report.
State lawmakers in several states have tried to address rideshare safety concerns with varying degrees of success.
Pending legislation in New Jersey and Massachusetts aims to prevent sexual assault and misconduct against passengers.
The New Jersey measure would require rideshare companies to share information concerning sexual misconduct investigations into a driver and would allow companies to ban drivers during an investigation. It remains in committee.
The bill in Massachusetts, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Rausch, would create a specific criminal penalty for the sexual assault of a passenger by a rideshare driver. The bill also would deem any rideshare passenger incapable of consenting to any sexual contact during a ride.  A hearing on the bill took place yesterday.
“We need to be able to make sure that people are safe and that people can trust those kinds of spaces to be safe,” Rausch said.
States and cities eye stronger protections for gig economy workers

In May, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation that creates criminal penalties for impersonating a rideshare driver. Starting July 1, the crime counts as a second-degree misdemeanor. Uber supported the legislation.
But in Rhode Island, Lyft is pushing against legislation that would require fingerprinting as part of criminal background check. Brendan Joyce, the Lyft public policy manager, testified against the measure in April, saying the fingerprinting requirement relies on the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information System, which Joyce said has incomplete data. He also asserted that fingerprint checks “disproportionately impact and have potential discriminatory effects on communities of color.” Uber also testified against the proposal.
Rhode Island legislators introduced another measure that would prevent people under the age of 16 from using a rideshare service alone. Both bills are being held for further study.
 Driver protections

JC Muhammad, 57, has been a rideshare driver in and around Chicago since about 2016.
Now, he works full-time as an organizer for faith-based organizations and groups that support rideshare drivers, including The People’s Union, a membership-driven organization aimed at supporting workers in the city.
Muhammad was attacked by a passenger during a Lyft ride in 2022, he said. The passenger asked to borrow Muhammad’s phone and opened its Cash App. The passenger also hit him over the head twice, he said, and threw a brick at his car, denting the side.
“I was angry as hell,” Muhammad said. “I really wanted to engage the kid, but I said, ‘No, let me get back in my car.’”

After sharing the incident with Lyft, the company responded by saying it would not match him with that passenger again. But the person who rode with Muhammad did not match the profile of the person who originally requested the ride, he said.
Muhammad also said he couldn’t go to the police because he did not know the identity of the person who was in his car — and Lyft would not share the identity of the account holder who ordered the Lyft.
Uber and Lyft customers have the option to verify their account, but not everyone does, Muhammad said.
“That gives us some measure of comfort, but it really doesn’t do enough, especially when it comes to calling rides for other people,” Muhammad said. “The account holder may not be the actual passenger.”
Rideshare drivers across the country — especially those of color — are frequently harassed, according to a 2023 report from the Strategic Organizing Center. The center is a coalition of labor unions representing more than 2.5 million workers across the country.
The survey of over 900 app-based rideshare drivers found the majority had been verbally abused and more than a quarter of respondents were threatened with physical harm. Nearly 15% of the drivers were grabbed, groped or hit, according to the report.
There have been several incidents in Chicago where drivers are lured by a false account to a location where they are then robbed or attacked, said Deana Rutherford, the communications manager at the Chicago Gig Alliance, a subset of The People’s Lobby.
“These drivers just show up and they have no idea who’s about to get into their car,” Rutherford said. “And Uber doesn’t know who they are either.”
To address some of the safety and labor issues drivers were facing, the Chicago City Council began considering an ordinance backed by The People’s Lobby that would require passenger verification.
If passed, the ordinance would have also set a minimum wage for drivers, require companies to be more transparent about fares, have them disclose the details of driver account deactivations and more. Both Uber and Lyft initially opposed the ordinance. Uber warned the measure’s sponsor that the changes in pay rates would drive up costs for customers and force the company to cut 10,000 drivers, according to a letter Uber sent to a city alderman that was obtained by Stateline.
But Uber this week agreed to a deal that scraps Chicago’s ordinance in exchange for the company’s support for state legislation that would allow rideshare drivers to unionize, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

Julia Beverly for the Georgia RecorderSelina and Howie Newton were first-time visitors at Marietta’s Juneteenth festival, but the anniversary of the official end of slavery in America has always been a big deal in their household. 
Selina enjoys decorating the front of their house during the month of June to mark the occasion. And as they strolled through Marietta Square last weekend, the couple sported Juneteenth shirts and color coordinated shoes. 
“We really don’t celebrate the Fourth of July as Independence Day the way some people do,” Howie Newton said. “So that has a lot to do with why I feel the way I do about Juneteenth.” 
This year, Georgia’s Juneteenth celebrations  are happening at a fraught time nationally for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as President Donald Trump moves to scale back DEI programs and funding. And some of these Juneteenth celebrations, including here in Georgia, have felt the impact, as some sponsors withdraw their support. 
“In spite of those efforts and the repressive, tense political climate generally, there will be a number of Juneteenth celebrations here in the metro Atlanta area and throughout the state this year,” said Clarissa Myrick-Harris White, who is a professor of Africana studies at Morehouse College.

Juneteenth commemorates the freeing of the final group of slaves under the Emancipation Proclamation. Though President Abraham Lincoln issued the proclamation in 1863, it took an additional two years for the news to reach Galveston, Texas. It wasn’t until General Gordon Granger led Union troops through Galveston on June 19, 1865, that over 250,000 slaves learned of their freedom. 
Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021 after the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by former President Joe Biden. Georgia Gov. Brain Kemp signed similar legislation in 2022 making Juneteenth a state holiday with paid time off for state employees.
While at least one state – West Virginia – has revoked the 2025 holiday observance, Juneteenth is still a federal and state holiday in Georgia.
“It has just really always been the intention to embrace what freedom is, embracing freedom and inclusion all the way across the board,” said Jeriene Bonner-Willis, the Cobb County NAACP president. “This has been about unification. As we look at 2025, it’s a celebration. It’s supposed to honor the history and the experience of enslaved, African Americans.”
Pat Snipes, the executive director of the Before Slavery Project, saw Juneteenth as the perfect place to reach her target audience. The project aims to educate people on the rich history and legacy of the people caught up in the Transatlantic slave trade. 
With an exhibit at the Marietta History Center just steps away from where she set up her booth, Snipes said she hopes to help African Americans forge deeper connections with their culture. Aware that the emphasis on Black history could be diminished by DEI cutbacks, Snipes is determined to continue her mission not only on Juneteenth, but every day. 
“It’s disheartening to hear that our country is taking several steps back, but we can’t let that stop us,” Snipes said. “We have to continue to move forward and be hopeful.”
While some celebrated Juneteenth on Saturday, others participated in “No Kings” Protests across the state. This juxtaposition occurred in Marietta, where smells of smoked meat and fresh popcorn floated in the air joining echoes of noisy chants from neighboring protesters.
The anti-Trump protests transpired as a nationwide response to a D.C. military parade for the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army. Saturday was not the first time Trump has hosted a large event around Juneteenth. He faced criticism during his first term for planning a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19, 2020. The rally was eventually rescheduled for the next day, but not until after Trump claimed to popularize the holiday with his scheduling conflict. 
Marietta wasn’t the only city celebrating Juneteenth last weekend. Atlanta also celebrated with a parade and music festival in Piedmont Park. Other cities, including Augusta, will continue celebrations throughout the week.

Atlanta and Augusta’s festivals faced difficulty fundraising after sponsorships were withdrawn due to DEI reversals. Johnny Gregory III, the president of Band of Brothers Augusta, which hosts the Juneteenth festival, said that a few previous sponsors of the annual celebration ended their sponsorship after company-based DEI changes. 
“We’ve noticed that it’s more of the corporations that are internationally and nationally known that are not supporting the local events and cultural events,” Gregory III said.
Juneteenth Atlanta faced similar problems, according to an Instagram post just days ahead of last weekend’s celebration.
“As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, we’ve faced unexpected challenges with sponsorships this year due to the national DEI backlash. But here’s the thing: our community deserves this celebration, and we believe in the power of coming together!” the post said.
As Juneteenth celebrations continue, a shared sense of preservation and perseverance remain. 
Small business owners in Augusta have helped fill the gap of withdrawn sponsorships. In Atlanta, festivities continued through summer showers. Even with the challenges this year, supporters of Juneteenth say the holiday serves as a reminder and opportunity to celebrate and reflect.
“Music, parades, food and cultural commemorations are very good and important, but it has to go beyond that,” Myrick-Harris White said. “There needs to be an understanding that Juneteenth, in and of itself, as a national holiday, is symbolic. It affirms the importance of remembering historical events that uniquely impact Black people. I applaud the symbolic act as a reminder, it’s a reaffirmation of the promise of freedom.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC04317-Georgia-Stars-Academy-of-Dance-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-19 04:02:08.398649

They were there to begin saying goodbye to state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, who were gunned down in their Brooklyn Park home early Saturday because of Melissa Hortman’s politics, and especially support for abortion rights, law enforcement officials say.
Unlike the fractious and chatty House over which Hortman presided for five years, the vigil included no speeches and no politics to speak of.
Instead, the vigil featured music that crossed culture and genre; the flicker of candlelight in a darkening sky; and reverential reflection about the gift of life and its finitude — all in stark contrast to the nation’s increasingly toxic political atmosphere.

The orchestra performers played a rendition of “Make me a Channel of your Peace”; Hortman, a Roman Catholic, carried around a small prayer card with these words of St. Francis of Assissi on it, her mother said this week.
Hortman merely tolerated the spotlight and was not well known by the broader public, but she won fierce devotion from the countless people she mentored, Capitol staff, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor House caucus she led for more than eight years — and her Republican adversaries, too.

“She was my friend,” said Rep. Danny Nadeau, a Republican who represents the other side of District 34, which Hortman represented for two decades. “She’s an example of what a public servant should be.” The two worked on human services issues together.
The Red Lake Drum Group played “Prayer Song,” “Traveling Song” and “Bear Song,” the rhythms like a heartbeat for a community in need.
Law enforcement officials say Hortman was on a list of targets compiled by the man they say is the killer. State Sen. Erin Maye Quade, DFL-Apple Valley, was also on the list. She said she’s spent the past five days alternating between states of grief, rage and numbness.
The vigil was helping, though: “I feel steadier now,” she said, even as Barber’s “Adagio for Strings” blended soaring hope and crushing despair in the same instant.

I, too, sing America.
I am the darker brother.
They send me to eat in the kitchen
When company comes,
But I laugh,
And eat well,
And grow strong.
Tomorrow,
I’ll be at the table

Nobody’ll dare

They’ll see how beautiful I am
And be ashamed—
I, too, am America.
“The Weary Blues” 
Droning a drowsy syncopated tune,
Rocking back and forth to a mellow croon,
I heard a Negro play.
Down on Lenox Avenue the other night
By the pale dull pallor of an old gas light
He did a lazy sway….
He did a lazy sway….
To the tune o’ those Weary Blues.
With his ebony hands on each ivory key
He made that poor piano moan with melody.
O Blues!
Swaying to and fro on his rickety stool
He played that sad raggy tune like a musical fool.
Sweet Blues!
Coming from a black man’s soul.
O Blues!
In a deep song voice with a melancholy tone
I heard that Negro sing, that old piano moan—
“Ain’t got nobody in all this world,
Ain’t got nobody but ma self.
I’s gwine to quit ma frownin’
And put ma troubles on the shelf.”
Thump, thump, thump, went his foot on the floor.
He played a few chords then he sang some more—
“I got the Weary Blues
And I can’t be satisfied.
Got the Weary Blues
And can’t be satisfied—
I ain’t happy no mo’
And I wish that I had died.”
And far into the night he crooned that tune.
The stars went out and so did the moon.
The singer stopped playing and went to bed
While the Weary Blues echoed through his head.
He slept like a rock or a man that’s dead.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)A report released Wednesday by the Maryland Comptroller’s Office confirmed what thousands of Maryland workers already knew: The state’s economy is deeply tied to the federal government.
The 91-page report, which was produced in partnership with the University of Maryland, College Park’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, aimed to establish a “baseline” of how the state’s economy relies on federal jobs, retirement income, grants, direct payments and contracts by studying data from before the start of the second Trump administration. The project team analyzed data from over the past decade, but focused on the last fiscal year, to determine what the federal government “has meant and still means” to the Maryland economy.
The report described the federal government as the state’s “economic engine” and a driver of its employment growth. In the most recent annual data, the report found that Maryland drew more than $150 billion in economic value from the federal government, including $26.9 billion in income alone.
The release of the report comes a week before the inaugural meeting of the General Assembly’s Joint Federal Action Oversight Committee. The 26-member committee, co-chaired by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), was established in April by the legislature to “monitor and keep legislators informed” of changes to federal funding, polices and regulations.
In a letter included in the report, Comptroller Brooke Lierman said that for decades, Maryland and the federal government have enjoyed a mutually beneficial economic relationship.
“The Trump Administration’s sweeping cuts to federal government jobs and spending put this longstanding relationship at risk,” Lierman said.
Maryland invests $1 million more in ‘Feds to Eds’ program for laid-off federal workers

Maryland houses 14 major military installations and more than 60 federal agency offices, including the headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Social Security Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the report said.
Despite being only the 18th largest state in population, Maryland ranks third in the number of federal employees, behind only Virginia and Washington, D.C., with its estimated 229,000 federal workers, according to the report. Those employees make up about 6% of the state’s total workforce and 10% of its wages, with an average salary of $126,468.
In addition to active federal workers, the report said more than 150,000 people receive retirement income, totaling about $8.8 billion each year.
The report said this significant federal presence across the state has fostered a “symbiotic relationship” between federal agencies and state institutions, such as Maryland’s colleges and universities serving as “feeders” for scientists and national security analysts.
But the state lost an estimated 5,300 federal jobs in March and April alone due to Trump administration cuts to federal spending and jobs, cuts that will damage the state’s economy, the report said.
Maryland also ranks third in federal contract spending per capita, again behind Virginia and Washington, D.C. In fiscal 2024, the federal government spent about $46.2 billion on contracts in Maryland and about $31 billion in grants. It also spent $38 billion in direct payments, which include costs such as subsidies to farmers, unemployment benefits, and Social Security and Medicare payments.
While crafting the report, the project team hosted roundtable discussions with federal workers who had been fired, laid off or placed on administrative leave.
The team found that a majority of the workers they spoke to were bracing for a long, challenging job search and expected a pay cut of 10-25% at their new position given the relatively lower salaries for nonprofit or local government jobs. Many were sad leaving their jobs as they were “passionate about their work and the service they provided to the public”.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
University of Maryland professor Vojislav Maksimovic, a member of the project’s team, said the report follows one released about 10 years ago which analyzed federal expenditures in Maryland.
“Clearly a lot has changed over the time, and they wanted to take another look and be prepared for whatever might be coming,” Maksimovic said in an interview Wednesday.
He added that the next phase of the project will also include scenario analysis to study the ripple effect of potential federal cuts. For example, he said, if a federal agency sees cuts to its contracts, its workers may not go out to restaurants as often or be able to shop as much.
“This report looks at direct effects,” Maksimovic said. “But the indirect effects are also going to affect everybody, and we’re going to be trying to quantify those effects.”
Maksimovic emphasized the value the partnership between the school and state government provides — both for Maryland as well as the many graduate and doctoral students who contributed to the report.
In the report, Robert H. Smith School of Business Dean Prabhudev Konana said that as a public, land-grant institution, the university has an “unwavering commitment to workforce development and the promotion of business excellence, driven by our fundamental belief that the economic vitality of Maryland is a shared responsibility.”
Wednesday’s report will be followed by a second later this summer which will include analysis of different scenarios to estimate the financial impacts of federal actions on the state’s economy, including the 2026 fiscal year budget and already-implemented federal cuts.
The project’s final output will be an interactive tool which will let users input specific scenarios by agency, program or county, and calculate the resulting lost wages or spending.
Konana said in the report that the “intuitive visual interface” will help policymakers and stakeholders “visualize and understand the cascading impacts of federal funding variations at both state and county levels.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/federalworkers-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-19 06:59:46.365201

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Hours after being sworn in as Prince George’s County Executive on Wednesday, Aisha Braveboy announced that George Nader will be the county’s next police chief.
Nader, who has worked as the assistant chief for the Metro Transit Police Department since 2016, worked previously in Prince George’s for 20 years that began in 1996 that included the rank of deputy chief.
“I am a man of faith. I do believe that the Lord puts our path in front of us. It’s up to us to take that path. I believe he put me here with such a talented team,” Nader, 54, said during a news conference in Largo where he was introduced. “From the bottom of my heart, county executive, thank you for the opportunity. I will not let you down.”
It is the third major appointment by Braveboy since her June 3 election, even though she was only officially sworn in Wednesday.
Nader replaces Police Chief Malik Aziz, who was one three finalists for the same position in Phoenix when he was replaced Wednesday by Nader. Aziz was hired in March 2021 by former county executive and now U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D).
“His leadership helped guide Prince George’s County through unprecedented challenges and his commitment to professionalism and progress will not be forgotten,” Braveboy said of Aziz. “We truly wish him the best in future endeavors.”

A spokesperson from the police department did not respond Wednesday evening to a phone message and an email seeking comment.
The event to announce Nader at the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building in Largo was packed with supporters, including state and county officials, several of the county’s municipal police chiefs and leadership of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 89.
Del. Karen Toles (D-Prince George’s) recalled working with Nader on county legislation when she served on the County Council from 2010 to 2018. Nader worked as a commander at the police station in her council district in the Suitland area.
“I am so elated and proud of County Executive Aisha Braveboy for this pick,” Toles said after the news conference. “I am going to be telling all my colleagues in the [Prince George’s] delegation to support him. He understands the job and the people in the community.”
One of those people was Elsie Jacobs, a community leader in Suitland who turned 84 this month.
“Thank you!” Jacobs yelled as Braveboy was joined by several others at the podium. Standing alongside Braveboy and Nader were County Council Chair Edward Burroughs III; George Nichols Jr., a police veteran in the department who Nader announced as his assistant chief; and Melvin Powell, who Braveboy announced Wednesday as a director of public safety.
“I think this is the first time since I’ve been on this Earth that the police chief, fire chief, the council, the county executive and [public safety director] will come together. I think Prince George’s County will make history,” Jacobs said after she was asked to give a few remarks at the podium.

Even before Braveboy officially became county executive Wednesday, she already worked on naming several people to her administration. Less than a day after her election she tapped Maxene Bardwell, an administrator in Montgomery County, to serve as chief administrative officer, and last week she named Shawn Joseph as interim superintendent for the county’s public schools.
Joseph will replace former Superintendent Millard House II. House, who was pushed out after a vote of no confidence by the county teacher’s union, left on Wednesday.
In a statement Tuesday, the county-executive elect announced two more people to serve in her administration.
Vennard Wright will serve as director of the Office of Information Technology. Wright is currently president and CEO of PerVista, an artificial intelligence company that helps detect firearms and other weapons.
Betsy Ramirez will become an education liaison in the county executive’s office. Ramirez worked as a school counselor in the Montgomery County public schools from 2006-2023.
Braveboy had a message Wednesday for the county’s more than 900,000 residents in her choice for Nader as police chief.
“This appointment is a commitment,” she said. “A commitment to equity in policing, to innovation in practice and to a safer future for every community … Chief Nader’s return to this department is not simply to resume a role, but to reimagine what’s possible.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Aisha-Braveboy-and-George-Nader-6-18-2025-1024x631.jpg,,,2025-06-19 06:59:46.365201

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland Deputy Health Secretary Ryan Moran, the official tasked with overseeing Medicaid and health care financing, will leave Maryland for a new position in Washington state come August.
Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson (D) announced Wednesday that he had selected Moran to direct the state’s Health Care Authority, which administers Medicaid for the state, manages health benefits for state employees and coordinates behavioral health supports.
“Ryan’s passion and experience make him a great choice to lead the Health Care Authority,” Ferguson said in a prepared statement Wednesday. “His expertise will help us provide equitable, high-quality health care to the people of Washington.”
Moran currently serves as deputy secretary for Health Care Financing and Medicaid director, and will continue to serve in those positions until August. It’s not clear if the department has anyone lined up to fill Moran’s position when he leaves.
“I am honored to join Governor Ferguson to lead the Washington State Health Care Authority to support strengthening the health and wellbeing of nearly a third of Washingtonians through the delivery of health care coverage via Medicaid, public and school employee benefits, and behavioral health and recovery,” Moran said in a written statement.
“I look forward to advancing the work and mission of the agency in such a critical time for health care nationally and am committed to ensuring those we serve receive access to integrated, person-centered care,” his statement said.
Kalyanaraman becomes latest to leave Maryland Department of Health

News of Moran’s departure comes on the heels of other changes at the health department in recent weeks. Nilesh Kalyanaraman, the former deputy secretary of public health services, left the department earlier this month. The health department has also lost a former chief of staff and a communications spokesperson.
In February, Moran stepped in as acting-secretary when the former health secretary, Laura Herrera Scott, left amid several controversies at the department. Current Secretary Meena Seshamani took over as head of the department in April.
“His (Moran’s) leadership has cultivated operational excellence in the daily operations to serve Marylanders enrolled in Medicaid, along with making innovative advancements and investments in social determinants of health and behavioral health services,” Seshamani said in a written statement.
“I want to thank Ryan for his commitment to strengthening Maryland’s Medicaid program since he joined MDH in April 2023 and also for his service as Acting Secretary of Health earlier this year,” her statement said.
It’s a busy time for the state’s Medicaid director, especially as the Trump administration works to make significant changes in funding to the joint state-federal health care plan. State officials are watching Congress to see how severe federal cuts to Medicaid will be for Maryland, as federal lawmakers deliberate budget reconciliation legislation that calls for steep cuts in federal spending.
The health department is also transitioning into a new hospital system, known as the AHEAD model, at the start of nezt year. While the transition began under President Joe Biden (D), the Trump administration has signaled interest in reevaluating Maryland’s current authority to set hospital rates in the state as negotiations continue.
Moran led the health department through the “Medicaid unwinding” following the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency. During the pandemic, annual Medicaid eligibility determinations were suspended, leading to a surge in enrollment. When annual redeterminations resumed in 2023, the health department had to reevaluate the eligibility of all 1.8 million Medicaid recipients in the state, a hefty undertaking that eventually cut enrollment to about 1.6 million people.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In November, Moran worked with members of the developmental disability community to help iron out administrative issues that were leading some recipients of Medicaid disability waivers to “erroneously” lose coverage for their care.
Laura Howell, CEO of the Maryland Association of Community Services, said Moran had been helpful during those administrative challenges with Medicaid. She wishes him Moran success in his new position.
“He’s been a very responsive, collaborative leader,” Howell said. “We’re really sorry to see Ryan leave his position at MDH … We wish him the best.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4487-Copy-scaled-e1750291141301-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-19 06:59:46.365201

The court upheld the law Wednesday. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court ruled 6-3 Wednesday to overturn a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
In Pride month, transgender Marylanders reflect on strengths, weaknesses, of state protections

Tennessee’s House Republican Caucus issued a statement calling it “a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision.
“We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors,” the group said in a statement. “We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor [Bill] Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.

U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out when asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion that the case “carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field.”
“The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” Roberts wrote.
“Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,” he wrote.
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

Statewide we used to have about 20,000 homes for sale during the spring and summer buying season, now we have less than 5,000.
Try to buy a home today in the greater Hartford region, a region of 600,000 people in the roughly 10 mile radius from the city center. You’ll find just 416 total homes at any price point for sale at the time of writing. In the whole of Fairfield County (960,000 population) there are just 483 homes for sale for less than $600,000. There are functionally no homes to purchase.
But what of those who are comfortable in already owning their homes? Well they are trapped too. Unable to move to take advantage of job opportunities, size up to accommodate a growing family, or downsize into a more walkable place as they age. In short, the current housing market is failing everyone.
Just how severe is our housing crisis? Turns out it is worse than even I thought, the recently completed analysis by ECONorthwest found a total housing shortage of 379,000 homes. The scale of this shortage is immense and admittedly hard to fathom. What this means practically is our state with just over 1.5 million homes today, only has 80% of the homes a natural unconstrained market would provide. This shortage has cost our state a full federal representative in Congress.
Our current annual home permitting rate in Connecticut is between 5,000 and 6,000 homes. It would take about 63 years to permit our way out of this crisis at our current rate, without any new growth over that time. You’ll hear opponents of building housing deflect and point to “the five L’s” of home building in a well rehearsed dance. Labor, Lending, Lumber, Lots, and Laws/Regulations. While a nice deflection, the first four matter little if getting government approval to build a new home is nearly impossible.
I spent the better part of a year tracking housing denials across the state of Connecticut and over the last two years our towns denied no fewer than 8,000 homes, roughly 40% of all homes proposed in our state end up being denied. 

Let me share a few examples of what “local control” looks like in practice:

Newtown: Between 2022-2025 has denied 853 homes during the permitting process including a proposal to provide housing to 172 of our seniors. This session their state delegation snuck through a rat which strips the ability to ever develop housing on that site again. Meanwhile the first selectman sent a letter to our governor that stated: “Newtown has a long history of responsible and community driven land use policy.” – Responsible to whom?
Enfield: Recently negotiated with a builder to eliminate 53 homes in order to add 20 parking spaces near the soon-to-be-completed Enfield train station paid for at great state taxpayer expense.
New Canaan: Invented new fire safety regulations to deny housing; turning away 102 homes for lack of a third staircase (state building code explicitly requires two) and another 93 homes for insufficient driveway width at only 20 feet (town regulations explicitly require a 20 foot driveway).
Newington: To this day has refused to update its zoning code to legalize incremental housing adjacent to its two Fastrak bus stations. Instead of our investment in the nation’s leading bus rapid transit system resulting in a dynamic new community forming, a transit adjacent car wash was recently constructed at the Cedar Street station. Why? Because it was legal to build while housing was not.

These are just a fraction of the thousands of homes lost during the permitting process here in Connecticut. The price of lumber and labor is immaterial if a builder is unable to secure building permits in a reasonable timeframe and at a reasonable cost. Is this level of nanny state micromanaging really making our lives better?
There is only one way out of our housing crisis, to build more housing and a lot of it. HB 5002 is the gentle path. It empowers towns to take the housing crisis seriously and plan for solutions while setting some reasonable guideposts for planning good practice. For instance, parking reform is a common sense way to add flexibility to new projects by reducing the spatial and financial cost of new development. 
An example is in Trumbull, today to add an in-law suite for your aging parents to your single-family home (a second kitchen and a lockable door) you’d need to provide for four (Yes! Four!) additional parking spaces. These parking mandates are often designed to block projects rather than meet true parking demand – plus they are terrible for our environment. It is time to evolve beyond them.
We used to permit over 20,000 homes annually in the Nutmeg state, I believe not only that we can, but that we must return to this level of permitting. Our state’s future is dependent on our leaders taking this stand, HB5002 is an appropriate step forward.

These weren’t forced upon me, they were a part of how I learned to understand the political world.
Like many kids raised in conservative households, I grew up proud of these beliefs. But once I got to college, I started hearing a different message: that those same values were outdated, wrong, or even dangerous. Now, this may just be where I chose to go to school, but I have heard similar concerns from friends at other schools.
Parents often worry that liberal institutions are brainwashing their kids. Some campuses do feel like ideological bubbles. According to the  2025 College Free Speech Rankings, schools like Harvard are ranked at the bottom. Harvard, being one of the most prestigious schools, you would think they would rank high when it comes to free speech. This is becoming especially relevant in today’s political climate, with conflicts such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One of the key findings in the 2025 College Free Speech Rankings was that 55% of students feel it is difficult to “have an open and honest conversation on campus”.
The idea that universities lean left isn’t some right-wing talking point, it’s a reflection of what many students experience. That’s not to say every college professor is pushing an agenda. I’ve had many professors who welcome debate and challenge me to think critically.
It becomes more of an issue socially.  According to a recent study  about free expression and constructive dialogue in the University of North Carolina System, 68% of conservative students are “at least slightly concerned” about social opinion. Meaning that many conservative college students fear that voicing their opinions will result in losing friendships.
Not only do students feel that they may lose the respect of thier peers, they also feel that there are too few opportunities to hear conservative speakers compared to liberal speakers. 56% of students believe that there are too few opportunities to hear conservative speakers compared to 20% for liberals speakers. Overall, there seems to be a lack of conservative voices in higher education, and when there are, they feel they need to keep their views to themselves.
This isn’t a call to cancel progressive ideas. It’s a call to make room at the table for political diversity, the kind that includes all views. College should actively seek to bring an equal mix of liberal and conservative speakers, creating forums where students can engage with different perspectives openly and without fear. In today’s increasingly polarized climate, civil political discourse is becoming harder to find. If we want a more politically stable future, that change can start on college campuses. When students feel pressured to self-censor, universities lose what should be their greatest strength: intellectual challenge. Which is considered a loss for everyone.
As a college student who goes to a very liberal institution, I feel it is becoming increasingly more difficult to voice my beliefs without fear of judgment. It’s not that I expect everyone to agree with me, but I do expect mutual respect, especially in a place that prides itself on open-mindedness. That expectation was shattered during the most recent election. I lost what I thought were close friendships simply because of what I believe. These weren’t heated political debates that ended badly, they were people cutting me off entirely, refusing to talk, or posting messages about how they can’t associate with people like me. I never said anything hateful. That experience made it painfully clear that tolerance on campuses often runs in one direction.
Conservatives are starting to lose faith in our institutions, and that trend is accelerating. According to a Gallup study, in 2015, 56% of Republicans had a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in higher education. Now, that number has plummeted to just 20%, while 50% now say they have little or no confidence in higher education. That is a drastic difference. This reflects a broader perception that these institutions no longer represent different viewpoints. When colleges are seen as spaces that overwhelmingly reflect progressive views, it’s no surprise that public trust has eroded. 
If higher education wants to live up to its mission of fostering open dialogue and intellectual growth, it must be willing to embrace political diversity and not just tolerate it. That means creating space not just for political argument, but political disagreement without fear.
Real learning happens when we’re exposed to ideas we don’t already hold, and when everyone feels free to contribute. Until that becomes the norm, the distrust in higher education will continue to grow, and so will the political divide. College should be a place where all students, regardless of their political beliefs, feel like they belong and can express their views freely. When college stops welcoming debate, it stops educating.

I qualified for food stamps. 
I shared a one-bedroom basement apartment with four other people. I drove a beat up Nissan pick truck through St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, building floor systems and hanging siding for new homes meant to replace those destroyed Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
But what I remember most are the people. A crew of volunteers — politically, racially, and religiously diverse — united by one thing: a belief that America is better when neighbors show up for one another.
That term of service changed me. It grounded me in community. It introduced me to some of the most selfless people I have ever met. And it launched a career built around a simple idea: that service — real, grassroots, people-powered service — can change lives.


That’s what AmeriCorps does. Quietly. Every day. In communities large and small, urban and rural, across all 50 states.
Which is why what is happening in Washington right now is so damaging.
Since April, the Trump administration has taken aggressive steps to dismantle AmeriCorps. The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) abruptly  terminated nearly $400 million in AmeriCorps grant funding — cutting off support to more than 1,000 nonprofits and 32,000 service members, including AmeriCorps Seniors. More than 750 FEMA Corps and NCCC members were issued stop-work orders with no notice. Over 85% of agency staff were dismissed, halting key functions like enrollment, member deployment, and grant disbursement.
These actions do not just jeopardize a federal agency; they destabilize community-based programs that serve children, seniors, veterans, disaster survivors, and so many others.
Here in Connecticut, those cuts landed hard.
At Big Brothers Big Sisters of Connecticut, we operate a Foster Grandparent Program, which gets 90% of its funding through AmeriCorps Seniors. It is simple and powerful: low-income older adults mentor children in under-resourced classrooms across Hartford, New Britain, Windham, Norwich, and New London. Many serve up to 40 hours a week, offering one-on-one support to students who need extra guidance and care.
In the past year alone, our Foster Grandparents helped nearly 400 children catch up to their peers. Without AmeriCorps, this program and others like it will have to shut down.
Thankfully, there is a path forward. The State of Connecticut joined 23 other states and the District of Columbia in suing the administration over the termination of funding awards. Just recently, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction, allowing participating states to restore AmeriCorps programs to status quo as of April 25.
This is a major win for communities like ours, but it is far from a total fix. The ruling provides no relief to the 26 states and territories not included in the suit. Tens of thousands of AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers remain without support. Their service terms have ended, their stipends and education awards are frozen, and their work has been cut short.
And the President’s FY26 budget still calls for the complete elimination of AmeriCorps.
That would be a tragic mistake.
AmeriCorps is one of the most effective, efficient, bipartisan service models our country has ever created. Each year, it mobilizes over 200,000 members to address local needs — tutoring students, supporting disaster relief, fighting hunger, helping seniors age with dignity. AmeriCorps members aren’t flown in by Washington — they’re recruited locally to respond to their communities’ needs.
While serving, corps members develop job skills and a commitment to the common good. For older adults, service reduces social isolation, builds purpose, and offers meaningful connection at a time in life when those things are often in short supply.
AmeriCorps works. That’s why nonprofits, schools, and faith-based organizations across the country depend on it. That’s why I believe in it. And that’s why I’m asking our federal delegation to act now.
Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, and U.S. Reps. John Larson, Joe Courtney, Rosa DeLauro, Jim Himes, and Jahana Hayes — please protect AmeriCorps. Restore full funding. Defend the people and communities this program serves. And speak out against the continued politicization of national service.
This is not about partisanship. It’s about people. It’s about keeping teachers supported, children mentored, homes rebuilt, and local nonprofits equipped to meet rising needs.
AmeriCorps taught me that service is one of the purest expressions of citizenship. We need more of it—not less. And in this moment, we need leaders who understand that public service is worth preserving.
Let’s not dismantle what’s working. Let’s protect it—and make it stronger.

And with adding $3.4 trillion to the national deficit, this boon for the wealthy could also be at the expense of an economy rattled by Trump’s on-and-off again tariffs.   According to […]","The U.S. Capitol is seen on a cloudy day in an undated photo. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)The Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill, or BBB, is a boon for America’s ultrarich at the expense of the poor and the working class. And with adding $3.4 trillion to the national deficit, this boon for the wealthy could also be at the expense of an economy rattled by Trump’s on-and-off again tariffs.  
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Republican bill slashes $295 billion from food stamps. Here in Alaska, this would mean that the 63,000 Alaskans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  would be at risk of losing a quarter of their benefits if the State of Alaska does not step up to fill the financial gap. The Republican bill also cuts $793 billion from Medicaid. This would result in 279,000 Alaskans (that’s approximately 38 % of our population) being at risk of insufficient health coverage. Jared Kosin, president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, said if Congress makes substantial cuts to Medicaid, “It would be catastrophic, not only for the health care system, [but] for Alaskans across our entire state.” Add in the elimination of renewable energy tax credits, you get a lot ‘ugly’ in this bill that negatively affects Alaskans. 
Oh, but not to worry as those supporting Trump’s push for unfettered development of Alaska’s oil, gas and coal, say Alaska will be better off with BBB. Somehow, high-risk, mega-projects, like oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — remember no major oil company bid on ANWR under the first Trump administration — and the Alaska liquefied natural gas pipeline will offset the economic harm of slashing Medicaid and upending viable renewable energy projects across the state. 
Adding more substance to the discussion of Alaska LNG is Roger Marks, a former petroleum economist with the state of Alaska, notes, “exporting LNG would not help the U.S. to either revive manufacturing, defend against unfair competition, maintain security, or protect emerging industries.” Marks continues, “The control of Congress may change in 19 months, and the president is gone in four years. No investor will touch a project until they are confident policies will endure over the long term.” In other words, there is no laying down pipe at the end of this year or in the immediate future. As such, the economic harm of the BBB to Alaskans remains real and immediate. 
 While these are disturbing facets of the BBB, there is a lesser-known provision that is the real ‘ugly’.  Republicans snuck in a little noticed but rather important provision into the thousand-page bill that would effectively remove the ability for judges to hold litigants in contempt of the court. The fine print of the bill would require judges to impose a security bond on the litigant even when the lawsuit alleges illegal conduct by the government. Because no ordinary — read, nonbillionaire — citizen or organization could ever afford to pay a bond large enough to challenge the federal government, restraining orders and injunctions on federal actions then become more of a request than a command of the court.
If this buried provision isn’t enough to signal that the intent of this provision is to specifically shield President Trump and members of his administration from the consequences of violating court orders, there is the “prior to enactment” part that seals the deal for them. The ability for courts to punish for contempt is considered essential to the administration of justice. 
If Republican senators play by their own rules, this provision should be struck out by the budget reconciliation rules established for a simple majority vote. The rules, recently imposed on Democrats, require that all components in a budget reconciliation bill have a direct effect on federal revenues. Clearly, this provision, intended to protect Trump from the rule of law, does not meet that standard. 
If this provision does make it to the Senate floor, it will be incumbent on our Alaska senators to move to amend and remove this judicial end-run. It’s no surprise that this end-run attempt happens when federal judges are considering whether or not to hold the Trump administration in contempt for violating orders related to deportation of immigrants. 
If this provision becomes law it would be a disaster for our system of checks and balances. It would bring us front and center with the constitutional crisis that’s been looming ever since Trump took office and began challenging Congress for control of the purse. 
The BBB has an ugly way of benefitting the ultrarich at the expense of working households. Even here in Alaska, where there is a high dependency on Medicaid and SNAP, the negative impacts will ripple far and wide. But worse, the Republican bill as currently written contains a constitutional poison pill. If swallowed the constitutional crisis awaits.

Rosa DeLauro lamented Wednesday night the lack of “civil discourse” in the country, whether it’s about the conflict between Israel and Gaza or the Trump administration’s response to protests opposing immigration raids.
That sentiment came up after a brief exchange with a member of the audience during The Connecticut Mirror’s “In the Room” event as the congresswoman discussed her support for Israel and escalating tensions in the Middle East.
DeLauro sat for an interview on a theater set as part of the CT Mirror’s interview series hosted by John Dankosky at CitySeed in New Haven. The intimate setting with the crowd led to her at times directly engaging with the audience. In some less tense moments, someone asked “How do we fight?” when she was talking about Trump’s overhaul of the government and certain services.
But a man in the audience and listening to her answers regarding Israel at times booed or said “genocide.” He later stood up and walked toward the stage where he threw a bill and said, “Here’s money, send it to Israel.” As he headed to the door, a New Haven police officer escorted him out of the theater.
“Do you see why we can’t have a civil conversation in the United States of America?” said DeLauro, a Democrat representing Connecticut’s 3rd District. “There is no civil discourse. I don’t get up and throw anything at anyone, nor would I ever do it.”
At one point, another member of the audience commented, “That is civil discourse.”
“I’m an elected official. My job is to be able to come to consensus and to bring people together, to not divide them,” DeLauro said to some applause. I don’t have any tolerance for that. Let’s have a conversation about these things.”
DeLauro went on to blame the Trump administration for seeking to divide the country on the issue of immigration as people protest the growing number of raids and detainments by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
She argued that ICE agents are going after people who have been in the country for years and are working, instead of prioritizing violent criminals. She pointed to a mother in New Haven who was recently detained in front of her children.
“That is not what we want, but that’s what this administration is doing. Why? Because they can divide the country on that issue, and they figure it’s in their political interests to do it. Let’s not feed into that,” she said to applause.
She was critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when asked if he was a good partner to the U.S. and of Israel’s handling of humanitarian aid for Palestinians. But she said Israel has a right to defend itself and said she wouldn’t engage in a conversation with anyone who won’t condemn Hamas.
And as President Donald J. Trump weighs whether to engage in a growing conflict between Israel and Iran, she said the U.S. should not strike Iran’s nuclear facilities.
DeLauro, 82, has been longtime staple in Connecticut politics and has served in the 3rd Congressional District since 1991. She rose up the ranks to served as the chairwoman of the influential House Appropriations Committee when Democrats were in the majority. With Republicans at the helm in the House, she is now the ranking member and still plays a large role in negotiating and drafting government funding legislation.
She gave a rundown in the style of “Schoolhouse Rock!” on how the appropriations process works in Congress and how her committee directs taxpayer dollars.
Similar to her other colleagues who have been in Congress for a while, DeLauro said the “camaraderie” between Democrats and Republicans isn’t the same. She said there were always differences of opinion, but “there wasn’t the kind of ad hominem attacks on individuals” that have become part of the political environment in Washington.
DeLauro said expanding the federal tax credit was one of the biggest accomplishments of her decades-long career because of the tangible relief it brought to working and middle-class families.
The expansion was included in Democrats’ pandemic relief legislation, the American Rescue Plan. It was enacted in 2021 but expired at the end of that year.
That enhancement increased the rebate up to $3,600 per child under the age of 6 and $3,000 per child aged 6 to 18. The tax credit was based on income and given out in monthly installments. It is now back to $2,000 per child under age 17.
“For me, it was social security for kids,” she said, running through numbers that show the one-year expansion lifted almost half of children out of poverty.
Debate over the child tax credit was one of the areas where DeLauro said she took on members of her own party. She wanted to make it permanent, but she said she faced resistance while negotiating with the Biden administration on how long the expansion should last. The cost of the program brought it to an end after a year.
She was pressed about where Congress could find more money and if it’s in places that are seen as a “third rail” in U.S. government: What about cuts to defense spending?
DeLauro said there are a lot of places to look for cuts to federal spending, saying there’s not much of an “appetite” in Congress to make cuts to the defense sector.
Connecticut’s economy is made up of a number of larger defense contractors and the supply chain that works with them. Sikorsky, which is owned by Lockheed Martin, is based in Stratford and part of DeLauro’s district.
“I don’t have problems where we would need to cut things. But I am going to support Connecticut’s industry,” DeLauro said, adding that if fewer helicopters are going to be made, “I’ll be damned if they’re not going to be made in Stratford, Connecticut, at Sikorsky.”
When asked about the frustration among some Americans that members of Congress have been in office too long, DeLauro seemed to indicate she would not be slowing down, pointing to her seniority in Congress. Debate over age and the length of service of politicians hit a fever pitch during the 2024 election with former president Joe Biden, who ultimately abandoned his efforts to win a second term.
DeLauro believes relationships are at the heart of her job and that she’s earned the trust she has from both parties. Axios recently reported that she plans to run for another term in 2026.
“I believe this, and it might sound very self-serving, but I do have the trust of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. They’ll know that I’m not trying to take them down a wrong road, or hurt them in some way, that I’m doing something that I think can be beneficial overall,” she said, noting it helped her with the child tax credit.
“That doesn’t happen in one year, two years, even five years. It happens over a period time to get to know you,” DeLauro said. “That’s not to say that the time comes when you should say, ‘I’ve had a good run.'”
She didn’t say when that time might come for her. But DeLauro made it clear throughout the hour-long interview that she does things on her own terms — and that includes decisions about her purple hair, tattoos and fashion choices.

But for the time being, she says she’s speaking out against “this administration’s campaign of censorship and control.” 
“It is my responsibility to respond to these attacks on the First Amendment,” Gomez told a small gathering in Eastern Kentucky on Wednesday. “I refuse to stay quiet while the government chips away at fundamental rights by weaponizing our regulatory authority.”

Gomez is one of three current commissioners — the only Democrat among them — overseeing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), an independent federal agency that regulates a broad range of communications industries, including television, radio, satellite, internet and cable. 
Traditionally, the agency has overseen the licensing of television and radio stations, taken on initiatives such as combating robocalls and worked to expand internet access across the country. But actions launched by the FCC in the months since the Trump administration has returned to power have greatly troubled Gomez. 
Under FCC chairman Brendan Carr, a Republican confirmed by the U.S. Senate during President Donald Trump’s first term, the regulator has launched investigations into public media stations’ use of sponsorships; opened a probe into the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Comcast, the parent company for NBC News; and revived complaints that media coverage was biased against Trump.  
​​”The FCC has targeted the editorial decisions of news networks, independent reporting by public media and internal labor practices by private companies. These are dangerous and unprecedented actions by an independent government regulator,” Gomez said. 
Gomez has embarked on a nationwide tour advocating for First Amendment rights and speaking out against what she sees as Trump administration actions to undermine those rights. Her first two stops were in two of the country’s largest cities, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., but her latest stop Wednesday was at a community center in the Letcher County community of Fleming-Neon, population around 500.

She said recent FCC actions are especially troubling because media corporations targeted by Trump and the FCC also have business before the FCC.
One example Gomez poses: CBS News and its parent company Paramount. 
One of the FCC’s revived complaints over media coverage centers on CBS News’ “60 Minutes” news magazine show. Trump had sued the show over claims that an interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris was deceitfully edited, something CBS News’ parent company Paramount has denied. 
Paramount is trying to settle the Trump lawsuit at the same time it is seeking approval from the Trump-appointed FCC for a merger with media company Skydance. As lawsuit settlement discussions continue, both the executive producer of “60 Minutes” and the president and CEO of CBS News have resigned. Bill Owens, the 60 Minutes executive producer, had said he could no longer lead the show independently.
“The FCC is supposed to make decisions based on law, facts and technical expertise, not politics,” Gomez said. “We need journalists who feel free to report the truth even when it cuts against our own political biases, and corporate parents who give journalists the independence they need.”
The Lantern sought the FCC’s response to Gomez’s criticisms by emailing an address associated with Republican FCC Chair Carr but received no response by late Wednesday.
Gomez also doesn’t know how long she’ll be in her position. Other members of independent agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Commission have been fired by Trump this year. She said she checks her email daily to see if she’s next, even though she plans to continue her tour even if the Trump administration seeks to remove her. 
“I don’t know why I haven’t been fired. I have not been quiet,” Gomez said. 
‘Speak their truth’ 
Other members of the panel Gomez joined in Letcher County were also not quiet in advocating for rights protected by the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, including freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and freedom to petition one’s government with grievances. 
  Tiffany Sturdivant (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)
Other panelists included a journalist, a church deacon, a former Democratic Kentucky state representative and the leaders of Letcher County nonprofits Appalshop, the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center and the Center for Rural Strategies which organized the event. 
“People being able to speak their truth is what is going to really be healing for our country,” said Tiffany Sturdivant, the executive director of the media, arts and education center Appalshop in Whitesburg. “I want us to really, really be brave. Freedom of speech is to me — it’s about telling the truth and not being afraid of that.” 
Wading through the near-instant accessibility of information and news sources is a different challenge, though. Sturdivant said people should try to “seek out the truth for themselves” and have conversations in person and in their communities beyond social media. 
While stereotypes about Eastern Kentucky are perpetuated in the national media, she said, there can be “something special” about having an in-person conversation that can dispel those narratives.
Wes Addington, executive director of the nonprofit law firm Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, told the gathered audience that it was up to people to continue to advocate for the right to petition one’s government — specifically in court before a judge.

Another panelist, author and former Democratic Kentucky state Rep. Bill Weinberg, mentioned how Elon Musk had at one point called for the impeachment of judges who defy or delay the Trump administration’s efforts to overhaul the federal government. 
Addington responded by saying while some court decisions go down in history as deplorable — such as the U.S. Supreme Court allowing the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II — decisions can be reversed. But not abiding by decisions in real time is “when you cross that line.” 
“When the decisions of the Supreme Court become something you can decide in the moment whether you’re going to follow or not,” Addington said, “that’s when you lose what this country was founded on.” 
Gomez said hearing from the other panelists reaffirmed her belief in the need for journalism and the need to protect journalism. 
“A lot of people that I speak to tell me they’re tired. It’s a little too soon to be tired,” Gomez said. “We need to take care of our precious liberties, and the way that we do that is by being aware and by speaking up and pushing back.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Top law enforcement officials briefed Utah lawmakers during closed-door caucus meetings on Wednesday about the shooting during the “No Kings” protest in Salt Lake City on Saturday  which saw a bystander marching in the protest shot and killed by a security volunteer.
Utah Department of Public Safety Commissioner Jess Anderson and Salt Lake City Police Brian Redd met separately with both Republican and Democratic caucuses at the Utah Capitol. House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, told reporters during a media availability that Anderson and Redd didn’t share many details. 
“Honestly, we don’t really know any of the details,” Schultz said. “(Anderson and Redd) can’t share any details, because it’s an ongoing investigation.” 
Schultz, however, said he’s confident the investigation will be “treated fairly” and provide answers to questions that “a lot of us have.” The speaker also said he’s “really proud of the way Salt Lake City and the state of Utah came together to make sure there wasn’t violence” during the rest of the protest. 
“I’m proud of the organizers of the protest, that was important to them, that they didn’t have violence,” the House speaker said. “And I really felt like overall things were pretty good. There is that one incident that’s sad, and we certainly condone any type of violence.”

Schultz added that lawmakers will be reflecting on the facts of the investigation when it’s finished. 
“We look forward to getting more information as it becomes available, and we’ll sift through what went wrong or what are the issues,” Schultz said. 
According to Salt Lake City police, the shooting happened after two men described as “peacekeepers” confronted another man, 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was carrying an AR-15 style rifle during the protest. One of the “peacekeepers” fired three shots from a handgun, grazing Gamboa but also hitting an “innocent bystander,” Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, who was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
Shortly after the shooting, police arrested Gamboa, and he was booked into jail for investigation of murder. Police say, however, that Gamboa did not fire his rifle. The two “peacekeepers,” who wore high-visability vests, were initially detained by police, but were released after being questioned. Police said the man who fired the three shots is cooperating with investigators. 
The protest was organized by Utah 50501, a state chapter of the 50501 Movement, a grassroots group that organizes rallies to protest actions by President Donald Trump and his administration. Organizers have expressed “profound heartbreak” for the death of Ah Loo. 
In the days following the chaotic shooting, unanswered questions remain, including details of who the “peacekeepers” were and how they were vetted, if at all, to be acting as armed security.

Event organizers said people who served as “safety volunteers” were “selected because of their military, first responder, and other relevant de-escalation experience,” and they said when those volunteers saw Gamboa with the AR-15 style rifle, they “believed that there was an imminent threat to the protesters and took action.” Organizers said the man who was involved in the shooting is a “military veteran.” 
Questions also remain regarding Gamboa’s intentions and why he brought a rifle to the protest. As of Wednesday, charges had not been filed against Gamboa or anyone else involved in the shooting. 
Should Utah consider changes to gun laws?
Utah is a “constitutional carry” state, which means its laws allow the open and concealed carrying of firearms without a permit for those who are legally allowed to possess them. In 2021, with HB60, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature eliminated the state’s concealed carry permit requirements. Now, anyone 21 and over who can legally possess a gun is free to carry it loaded and hidden in public. 
Unlike 26 other states, Utah — a Republican-controlled state — has not adopted a law prohibiting carrying long guns at state capitols or, according to Everytown Research & Policy, an organization that produces research on gun violence and advocates for gun violence prevention. The group has ranked Utah as No. 36 in the country for “gun law strength.”
When pressed on whether lawmakers would be open to considering some type of policy to restrict the open carrying of long guns during protests, Schultz declined to say what lawmakers will or won’t be willing to do, but “I can speak from my own perspective.” 
“Utah is a very proud Second Amendment state,” he said. “Finding that balance is what we want to try to do, and I think we’ve done a good job with it in the past.” 
Schultz, however, left the door open to a discussion. 
“As we enter into the legislative session and we have more details around what happened, I’m sure some of those conversations will happen and we’ll see where it goes from there,” Schultz said. 
‘Peacekeeper’ involved in shooting at SLC ‘No Kings’ protest is a military veteran, organizers say

While Democrats typically propose various bills during each legislative session seeking tighter firearm regulations, Utah’s GOP-supermajority Legislature usually doesn’t let those bills progress. 
Schultz said “any violence of any sort is terrible,” also pointing to the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses over the weekend.  
“It’s sad right now,” he said. “I think it speaks a little bit to the times that we’re living in.” 
Security discussion in the wake of Minnesota murders
Schultz said Anderson also briefed lawmakers on their own security, including resources available to lawmakers if they experience threats or have heightened concern. He praised the Utah Department of Public Safety for always being responsive to make sure lawmakers have protection when needed. 
House Majority Whip Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, said she saw the news from Minnesota, “I just kept thinking how we have got to find a way to turn down the heat when it comes to politics.” 
“We have to get to a place where we disagree without thinking the other person is evil,” she said, adding that it was “terrifying” that the man accused of shooting the Minnesota lawmakers had a list of names of other lawmakers. 
Minnesota House Democratic leader dead after ‘politically motivated assassination’

In the days after the Minnesota shooting, however, Utah Sen. Mike Lee drew widespread backlash for a pair of social media posts that appeared to make a joke about the suspect accused of the Minnesota shootings, claiming it was the result of “Marxism” and attempting to connect the suspect to Gov. Tim Walz. 
On Tuesday, Lee deleted the posts from X. His office has not returned a request for comment about them, and he hasn’t issued a public apology. 
Asked about Lee’s posts, Schultz brushed them off, saying he doesn’t spend time on X, (formerly known as Twitter). 
“If I get on Twitter and look at what people say about me, it puts me in a bad mood, so I don’t even get on Twitter,” he said. “I don’t think we have any comments around that. We’re focused on Utah.” 
Pressed on whether they condemn the tweets, House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise, said: “you’d have to ask the senator about his tweets; he’s the one that made them.”
“I’m in the same boat. I don’t spend much time on social media. … you’d have to ask the senator what he said and what he meant by it,” Snider said. 
Sen. Mike Lee takes down controversial X posts after widespread criticism

On Monday, House Democratic leaders issued a statement in the wake of the Minnesota shootings and the shooting during the Salt Lake City protest, calling them “heartbreaking but unfortunately not surprising” while also calling for more gun regulations.  
“The conditions for this kind of violence have been building for years, driven by a toxic combination of hateful rhetoric and easy access to firearms,” House Democrats said. “That rhetoric, often amplified by leaders at the local, state, and federal levels, has created an environment that often leads to violence.” 
House Democrats said their Republican colleagues often argue “guns don’t kill people — people kill people.” 
“Yet many of those same leaders use their platforms to target marginalized communities, spread misinformation, and stoke division,” they said. “We urge all elected officials to reflect on the impact of their words and how they contribute to the dangerous climate we face today.” 
House Democrats said they “remain committed to advancing policies that reduce gun violence, promote accountability, and protect the safety and dignity of every Utahn. We call on others to join us in that commitment.”
Later Wednesday afternoon, the full Senate — while convened to vote on several judicial and cabinet appointments from Gov. Spencer Cox — held a moment of silence for the victims of violence in and outside of Utah over the weekend. 
Senators bowed their heads for Ah Loo, as well as for the two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses who were shot, and the three killed during an unrelated act of violence seen in Utah over the weekend — a shooting at a carnival in West Valley City on Sunday.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah lawmakers say they want the 2026 legislative session to pave the way for development of one of their most sought-after new resources — nuclear energy.
The House Concurrent Resolution Regarding Advanced Nuclear Manufacturing, proposed by Rep. Carl Albrecht, R-Richfield, “expresses support for the advanced nuclear manufacturing industry and declares the state’s desire to have nuclear manufacturing done in the state.” 
“If we’re going to have some of these projects in the state of Utah, we just well be building them here, right?,” Albrecht told the Public Utilities, Energy, and Technology Interim Committee on Wednesday.

This year’s session, legislators passed HB249, a lengthy bill setting up the structure to push nuclear developments in the state. But, amid high competition among different states and multiple companies to sign nuclear technology deals, Utah wants to make its intentions to become a nuclear hub even clearer with a concurrent resolution during next year’s session. 
Utah has a chance to lead the way in the west, Albrecht said, since most nuclear facilities in the country are east of the Mississippi River.  
“We want to send the message as the governor, the legislature, that we want to help these technology companies overcome the remaining challenges regarding safety of the industry, manufacturing, transportation and waste management,” Albrecht said.
While concurrent resolutions have no force of law, when both legislative chambers and the governor sign into one, they send a message about the state’s position on a determined issue. The interim committee voted unanimously to adopt the proposal as a committee bill, meaning that it will advance to the House floor without another committee hearing in 2026. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Apart from the small nuclear reactors officials often reference, Albretch’s vision for the state includes projects related to medical radioactive isotopes, often used for diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, and recycling spent nuclear fuel that could be used for batteries.
Since the state approved HB249, Albrecht and other officials working on energy issues in Utah have received multiple calls about potential collaborations. Albrecht attributes the high interest to the state’s vast natural resources and the presence of entities like the White Mesa uranium mill and the San Rafael Energy Research Lab, which the state bought in 2024.
The state has also recently signed two agreements with nuclear developers, and is studying whether to lease part of Camp Williams, a Utah National Guard base, for a manufacturing facility for uranium enrichment hardware.
While many at the Legislature are enthusiastic about the nuclear prospects, some Utahns are receiving the news with skepticism, including those who have advocated for people harmed by Cold War-era nuclear weapons development in the state, who called for a deliberate process when considering radioactive projects.
As Cox advances nuclear agreements, he says the cost to develop technology is nothing so far

During the public comment hearing on the bill, Lexi Tuddenham, director of the environmental nonprofit HEAL Utah, said that while going down the nuclear path has promise, it also has a lot of peril, so communities that can be potentially affected by the technology should be included in the decision-making process.
“If we are truly to pursue this all-of-the-above energy approach, we need to be taking a truly clear-eyed look at what it implies and what the implications are,” Tuddenham said. “There is no long-term repository for the waste, and that means that it’s going to stay on site for a long, long time. Reprocessing at this point is not particularly efficient.”
Tuddenham also pointed out that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the state is suing for what it describes as “overburdensome” regulations, is needed to keep nuclear technology safe, which means that it needs to have enough staffing, funding and time to work appropriately.
However, for some, including Craig Peterson, who is a lobbyist but spoke representing himself, the state can’t afford to delay its nuclear plans. 
“Utah’s future is going to rely heavily, in my opinion, upon the availability of power,” he said during the public comment period. “And this is absolutely an opportunity that Utah cannot squander, that we cannot continue to delay.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy has signed a bill expanding the exemptions that allow some Alaskans who are absent from the state to receive Permanent Fund dividends.
House Bill 75, from Rep. Jeremy Bynum, R-Ketchikan, was one of four bills that became law last week.
“We were pleased to see that it was signed into law,” said Bynum on Tuesday.
Bynum was elected to the House in 2024, and HB 75 was his first bill. It also was the first bill from the House’s Republican minority caucus to become law this year.
The governor did not hold a signing ceremony, and the governor’s office did not issue a statement about the signing of that bill or three others that he signed last week. 
Official notices were published by the clerks for the Legislature on Monday.
“Having a little bit of fanfare would have been kind of a nice thing, but at the end of the day, it’s really more about what the bill is going to do and how it is going to help Alaskans,” Bynum said.
Under HB 75, Alaskans who are absent from the state while undergoing training for the U.S. merchant marine will not have that absence count against them when considering eligibility for the Permanent Fund dividend. 
College students who take holiday breaks away from Alaska also will not have those absences count against them, and members of the federal government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps and the Public Health Service commissioned corps will not lose PFD eligibility if deployed out of state.
The PFD department also will be able to conduct fingerprint background checks of its employees.
In addition to HB 75, Dunleavy allowed Senate Bill 80 and Senate Bill 137, renewing some of the state’s professional licensing boards and the state parole board, to become law without his signature.
He also signed Senate Bill 152, which names the airport in Ruby after longtime local pilot Harold Esmailka.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)A dozen demonstrators gathered half a block from the state Capitol Wednesday morning to urge Arkansas’ U.S. senators to vote against President Donald Trump’s suite of tax and spending cuts currently pending in the upper chamber of Congress.
Organized by chapters of the Arkansas Community Organizations, the demonstrators carried signs, spoke of how the legislation — dubbed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” by Trump and adopted by the GOP — would affect them and other Arkansans personally. They then entered the Victory Building and submitted comments to staff of Sen. Tom Cotton’s and Sen. John Boozman’s Little Rock office’s, which are in the structure.
William Gerard, the Southwest chapter vice president of ACO, said he receives Medicaid and SNAP benefits and Section 8 housing vouchers. If the tax and spending legislation makes it into law, he said, he was likely to end up homeless and unable to afford his medications due to being unable to meet work requirements that are part of the bill. 
“My medicines are in the thousands; I have seizures, I have cerebral palsy,” Gerard said. “I only get $50 in food stamps. What’s $50 going to buy these days? Nothing.” 
U.S. Senate GOP tries to ease the pain for states in sharing costs of SNAP benefits

When the group went to Boozman’s office to fill out comment forms, William Mitchener, a farmer from Jackson County and self-described registered Republican, told staff that he had two bins full of rice he wasn’t able to sell, which he said was due in part to cutbacks in federal programs that would buy his crops to “feed the world.” He said he’d been in Washington, D.C., over the weekend to see the military parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army — on the same day as Trump’s birthday — and said Boozman “couldn’t see me then.”
“I lost $100,000,” Mitchener said of his unsold rice. “How long do you think I’m gonna be able to continue doing that? I can’t make my payments, I can’t pay my taxes, and he’s going to cut my Medicaid. Man, I got to have some help.”
As the group streamed out of Boozman’s office to head to Cotton’s, they chanted: “This bill will kill.”
The so-called Big, Beautiful Bill is projected to increase the federal deficit by $3 trillion, despite GOP promises to cut back federal spending. That’s despite changes to benefits programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that are relied upon by millions of low-income Americans. 
Driving the increases are the GOP’s inclusion of Trump campaign promises such as no taxes on tips and overtime and extensions of the tax cuts passed in 2017, which are set to sunset this year if they aren’t extended.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6181150-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-18 22:01:15.327697

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Attorney General Tim Griffin on Wednesday asked a state court to prevent the Arkansas Board of Corrections from spending any public funds on a lawyer he says the board hired illegally.
Griffin sued the corrections board in December 2023, alleging it had violated the state Freedom of Information Act by discussing the hiring of an attorney outside of a public meeting and hiring him with no public discussion.
In Wednesday’s amended complaint, the attorney general argues that any use of public funds to pay the lawyer would amount to an illegal exaction resulting from its FOIA violations. The Arkansas Constitution allows any citizen to sue to prevent the unauthorized or illegal use of public funds.
Griffin also asks the judge to declare that a discussion between board chairman Benny Magness and member Lee Watson was an illegal public meeting, the board illegally entered executive session to discuss hiring an attorney, and failed to properly respond to a records request made by his office.
The revised complaint also seeks to enjoin the board from employing a lawyer in any future executive session and from paying any funds to the lawyer it “unlawfully” hired.
Wednesday’s court filing is the latest twist in a complex battle over who has ultimate authority over state prisons – the Board of Corrections or the governor. The Arkansas Constitution grants a fair amount of independent authority to the prison board under Amendment 33, which sought to distance certain boards and commissions from political interference.

 The winding road

The corrections board met in a 45-minute executive session on Dec. 8, 2023 to discuss an “employment matter.” Upon returning to open session, the board voted to hire a special counsel, then voted again to sign an engagement letter with attorney Abtin Mehdizadegan. A week later the attorney filed suit on behalf of the board against the governor and other officials challenging the constitutionality of two state laws the board argues violate Amendment 33.
Three days after the board’s votes on hiring Mehdizadegan, Griffin wrote to Magness advising him that the board not only violated the FOIA but also the state law requiring state agencies to certify a need for special counsel with the attorney general. Griffin gave the board another three days to “cure” its actions in another meeting.
The board did meet on Dec. 14, but only to ratify its engagement agreement with Mehdizadegan. Griffin filed his FOIA complaint in Pulaski County circuit court on Dec. 15.
On Dec. 19, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox found Griffin in “clear violation” of his legal duty to the board and gave him 30 days to work out an agreement with Mehdizadegan to let the lawyer represent the board. Fox later dismissed the suit. Griffin appealed to the state Supreme Court, which last month ruled that important issues in the case hadn’t been resolved and sent it back to Fox for more hearings.
In January 2024, in the board’s suit against the governor, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Patricia James temporarily blocked implementation of the two laws the corrections board challenged, and Griffin appealed, seeking to have that case dismissed. 
Two weeks ago, the state Supreme Court denied his appeal and returned the case to the lower court for further action.
This week, the corrections board sent a letter written by Mehdizadegan certifying its need to hire an independent counsel because of Griffin’s conflict of interest in representing the state against the board.
On Tuesday, Griffin acknowledged the board’s need for its own lawyer, but still maintained that Mehdizadegan was hired illegally.

And it’s not your stereotypical dairy operation.

Dari Processing, a fourth-generation company run by the Tuls family, which also owns Tuls Dairies of Rising City, expects eventually to haul in 1.8 million pounds of cow milk daily. The 240,000-square-foot facility will then process and package shelf-stable milk — which needs no refrigeration.
Popular in places like Europe and New Zealand and starting to catch on in the U.S., the aseptic milk can stay on the shelf for up to a year until opened. That’s possible through ultra-high temperature pasteurization and a sterile packaging process that will take place at the site.
Among key products to be distributed nationally and perhaps worldwide will be Dari’s Moo’v, a high-protein, lactose-free milk that comes in multiple flavors and kid-friendly packaging. 
TJ Tuls, at a groundbreaking event Wednesday, said that since he was a kid he wanted to be a pilot or follow dad, Todd, into the dairy farm business. But he said he knew the dairy industry had to evolve and modernize, and the new plant venture rising on nearly 40 acres will provide room for ideas and products to grow.
“We’re looking to level up dairy,” he said. 
Aging dairy processing plants
Tuls, his dad, his son and other family members were joined by Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, Seward Mayor Josh Eickmeier and other business and dairy leaders for the groundbreaking of the Dari facility at the Seward Rail Park.
The still-developing industrial park serving the Seward and Lincoln region is attractive for its proximity to Interstate 80, the BNSF railroad mainline, an airport and a regional workforce pool that includes the City of Lincoln. 
Tuls, during a YouTube interview, said another state also had been in the running, but Nebraska “wanted it significantly more” than the other.

Public funds boosting the Dari project include: $1 million in state-administered federal community development block grants, to be matched by the City of Seward; $8.6 million in tax-increment financing approved by the City of Seward and nearly $600,000 for infrastructure from a Department of Transportation economic opportunity program. DED also is awarding $500,000 of site and building development funds, and the state is helping to fund the extension of a main boulevard and sewer and water extensions to support the new plant.
Jonathan Jank, president and CEO of the Seward County Chamber & Development Partnership, said numerous partners helped secure the project. He said the last dairy processing plant built new in Nebraska was some six decades ago — in 1963.
“Today represents a generationally transformational project for our state’s dairy industry,” Jank said.
Not ‘almond nut juice’
Pillen, noting that his friendship with Todd Tuls goes back 25 years, said 95% of agriculture in Nebraska is family owned, and that he wants to see more family-owned brands in the state.
“I’ve seen enough Dollar Generals in this state to sink a ship,” he said. “No disrespect to publicly-traded companies, but we should be doing business with the family-owned businesses who are the stakeholders in our communities across the state. It’s who we are.”
He called the planned Dari operation — projected open in 2027 — a “big deal for Seward, the state of Nebraska and every family-owned ag business.”

Jim Pillen. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
Pillen, in an interview with Nebraska Examiner, referred to his disdain for products he says masquerade as milk — things like “almond nut juice.” He said the Dari processing plant should boost other dairy operations in the state. The plant, for example, will be processing milk from cows on area farms.
“Milk, just for the record, comes from cows, not from nuts,” he said, adding that the Dari operation “is focused on value-added agriculture.” 
Reduce fuel, energy use
Tuls told the group that Nebraska is a great state to milk cows and that his family has been doing that for four generations. 
But as milk plants have aged and operations slow, milk gets shipped farther away for processing.
“Adding new processing capacity helps ensure that we can continue our family’s legacy of milking cows here in Nebraska,” said Tuls. He projects that the plant will help keep 30% of the state’s milk production from being processed elsewhere and create more local jobs.

“By keeping Nebraska milk in Nebraska, we’ll reduce the amount of miles that trucks haul raw milk, reduce fuel usage and reduce our overall carbon footprint,” Tuls said.
He said the processing techniques at the state-of-the-art facility should give milk products a longer shelf life and eliminate the need for cooling prior to opening — helping also reduce the energy needed. 
“It’s the future of milk,” he said. 
Longer shelf life also opens more opportunities to ship finished projects domestically and globally, Tuls said, adding that the facility will be one of the few nationally that combines aseptic packaging and ultrafiltration into a single plant. 
“Ultrafiltration helps concentrate proteins and remove some of the lactose and sugars from milk, making it even healthier for you.”
‘Ducks in a row’
Jank said the Dari project helps close the gap needed to wrap up the first phase of the industrial park, which dates back about 15 years when planning began. Streets, power, other infrastructure and environmental concerns all were addressed in advance to create such shovel-ready sites ready to build on.

The first major business came around 2020, he said, with the opening of Petsource by Scoular’s $50 million freeze-dried pet food ingredient manufacturing facility. It has expanded since.
Other tenants include: WCR Inc., which builds and services heat exchangers; Levander’s Body Shop, and Plum Creek Seed Services. A Parker Baby facility also is to break ground this summer. 
Jank said he took on his current role 13 years ago and grabbed the baton to help recruit business and development for the industrial park area. 
“Nebraska really can’t grow without those sort of shovel-ready sites,” Jank said. “Businesses aren’t going to sit around and wait for communities to get their ducks in a row.”

Mike Jacobson of North Platte, chair of the Banking, Commerce and Insurance Committee, presides over a legislative hearing. Feb. 11, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)NORTH PLATTE, Neb. — A Nebraska state senator announced this week that he has faced a serious form of skin cancer for the past two years but remains committed to finishing his term and seeking reelection in 2026.
State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, in a Wednesday post, publicly announced to supporters that he was diagnosed the first week of January 2023 with metastatic melanoma, which can spread to other parts of the body. Jacobson said the cancer has spread to his right lung, and he’s continued a range of treatments over the past two years.
Jacobson said he’s faced challenges, including swelling and weakness in his legs and muscles, leading to occasional falls. The most recent led to a brief hospitalization this week.
“Despite these setbacks, I want to assure you that I am firmly on the path to recovery,” Jacobson wrote. “While my physical presence in the district may be limited at times during this healing process, please know that my commitment to serving our community remains unwavering.”
He continued: “My resolve to fight for the people of our district has never been stronger.”

Former Gov. Pete Ricketts appointed Jacobson to the Legislature in February 2022. Jacobson won a four-year term that November and can run for one more term under current limits. 
Legislative District 42 consists of Lincoln, Hooker, Thomas, McPherson and part of Perkins Counties. 
Jacobson is one of multiple senators who have faced public cancer diagnoses in recent years, including State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln and former State Sen. Tom Brewer of north-central Nebraska.
Jacobson announced his 2026 reelection campaign one week ago, when he pointed to his 2022 promise to put his district “over politics” and to get results. He currently chairs the Legislature’s Banking, Commerce and Insurance Committee.
The senator said he has received “excellent” care from North Platte’s Great Plains Health and the University of Nebraska Medical Center. He and his wife, Julie, thanked his care team.
Jacobson said he and his wife remain “cautiously optimistic as we face this journey together.”
“The continued prayers, kind words and support from constituents and colleagues mean the world to us,” Jacobson wrote, “and we are deeply grateful.”
No one else has announced intentions to seek Jacobson’s seat in 2026. The top two vote-getters of the nonpartisan legislative primary in May 2026 would advance to the November 2026 general election.

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Memphis police arrested a man Wednesday and charged him with stalking, aggravated criminal trespass and attempted kidnapping after he went to Mayor Paul Young’s house Sunday night. 
Trenton Abston, 25, jumped a wall leading into the subdivision in which Young and his family live, according to a Facebook post by Young. 
Memphis police said in a statement on Facebook that Abston walked directly to Young’s home after accessing the subdivision. He had a taser, gloves, rope and duct tape in his vehicle when arrested, according to police. 
Police viewed public and private security camera footage after residents reported earlier this week they saw a man behaving suspiciously in the neighborhood. 
The incident came less than two days after Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were shot and killed and a Minnesota state senator and his wife were shot multiple times by Vance Boelter, who was arrested after a two-day manhunt. 
“In today’s climate, especially after the tragic events in Minnesota and the threats my wife and I often receive online, none of us can be too careful,” Young wrote on Facebook. “The link between angry online rhetoric and real-life violence is becoming undeniable.”
A state representative from Memphis raised concerns about the potential for political violence in the aftermath.
“No resident — no public servant, no child, no spouse — should ever have to fear for their safety because of their service,” said Democratic Rep. Torrey Harris in a social media statement. “Trespassing at (Young’s) home and threatening his family crosses every line of human decency. This is not disagreement — this is dangerous and reckless.”

Greg Gianforte vetoed a bill to boost private community solar projects across Montana, arguing it gives “vast, unfettered discretion” to the Public Service Commission to determine solar credits.
“While I appreciate the sponsor’s commitment to expanding energy production and his good intention with Senate Bill 188, the bill’s lack of guidance to and guardrails on the PSC gives me great pause,” said Gianforte, a Republican, in his veto letter.
Sponsored by Sen. Christopher Pope, D-Bozeman, SB 188 passed with significant bipartisan support, although Pope said Thursday he wasn’t immediately clear if it would be up for an automatic veto override poll.
However, he said he believes the governor had been “ill advised” on the bill, which offered the opportunity to lower the cost of power.
“It’s just really unfortunate,” Pope said. “This should have been a straight line, and it should have been an easy consideration, and a lot of Montanans would have benefited.”
The bill would have allowed multiple households or businesses to share one solar array.
It created a framework for developers, such as private parties or municipalities, to build a solar facility that generates from 50 kilowatts to five megawatts. They’d be then allowed to sell the electricity to subscribers within a service area and the subscribers would receive a bill credit for their share of the project.
In his June 13 veto letter, however, Gianforte said the bill departs from a strategy of “unleashing innovation” in energy. He said it mandates public utilities connect with the solar projects and assign credits — with rules adopted by the Montana Public Service Commission.
“It is impossible to predict how the PSC will proceed with implementing Senate Bill 188,” Gianforte said. “Without clear statutory guidelines and guardrails, current and future PSC members could allow excessive credit rates, which consequently would impose unreasonable costs on ratepayers.”
Pope said he and other bill supporters are “extremely disappointed” the legislation got as far as it did without getting across the finish line, mainly because it “has so many opportunities to improve the Montana economy” and “create quality jobs.”
He also said it would have provided a potentially less expensive way to produce electricity over the long term.
The bill was not expected to cost the state any money.
“It’s very much supported by people across the state who are excited about the environmental stewardship that solar energy provides,” Pope said.
But he said the bill drew support from a diverse coalition.
It included an advocate from the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, a conservative lobbying group, who Pope said had an interest in the energy independence and consumer protection the legislation offered.
He said Big Sky Resort supported it, as did environmental groups and the mayors of Billings, Bozeman and Missoula.
He estimated it received 180 letters of support from the business community expressing an interest in investing in the Montana energy economy through the bill.
“It restored my hope that someday we’ll get back to a place where people of all different walks of life and points of view can find common ground and move ahead in a way that does no harm,” Pope said.
He also said NorthWestern Energy and Montana-Dakota Utilities testified against the bill at numerous public hearings.
“They have a right to support or not support things that would be in their interests, but they are routinely unable to put more modern approaches to energy generation and also consumer economics and other things into their playbook,” Pope said. “And it’s disappointing.”
In a statement, Northern Plains Resource Council member Scott Sweeney said the bill could have provided needed financial relief to Montana ratepayers.
He said Montanans are experiencing tough economic challenges, especially as NorthWestern Energy continues to raise rates, recently in advance of approval by the PSC.
“Gov. Gianforte is clearly out of touch, and this veto puts the interests of wealthy, corporate energy executives above the needs of Montana’s families, small business owners, farmers, and ranchers,” said Sweeney, also retired general manager of Fergus Electric Cooperative.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1187889308-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-06-18 20:59:26.645723

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Over 100 state and local officials from the Midwest and West, including  North Dakota and South Dakota, are asking the U.S. Senate to eliminate tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration as part of a federal budget reconciliation bill.
Established by Congress and then-President George W. Bush in 2008, the 45Q tax credits incentivize companies to capture carbon dioxide from processes such as ethanol production and sequester it underground, so it won’t contribute to climate change by acting as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The carbon can also be sequestered as part of enhanced oil recovery, in which pressurized gas is used to push more oil to the surface.
Opponents say the credits don’t work as intended.
“The 45Q tax credits really only make sense to the industries that are poised to make billions of dollars from them,” said North Dakota state Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo. “They are supposedly intended to reduce carbon emissions, but in fact, 45Q tax credits pay polluters for polluting and subsidize private oil production at the expense of the taxpayer.”
Companies receive up to $85 per metric ton for regular sequestration and up to $60 per metric ton for sequestration via enhanced oil recovery — though there is a provision in a draft portion of the Senate reconciliation bill that would raise the maximum oil recovery credit to $85.
The repeal effort includes officials from Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. A few of those officials held a virtual press conference Wednesday.
South Dakota state Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, described the tax credits as wasteful spending.
“We are concerned about preserving taxpayer dollars, and I guess that’s the main gist of our conference today,” Hohn said.
Mathern said repealing the tax credits would put projects like Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed five-state carbon dioxide pipeline “in dire danger.”
“And that’s really positive,” he said.
Summit’s project alone could qualify for more than $1 billion annually from 45Q credits. It aims to capture some of the CO2 emitted by dozens of ethanol plants and ship the carbon via pipeline to a sequestration area southeast of the oilfields in western North Dakota.
North Dakota approves CO2 storage for Summit pipeline

Earlier this year, South Dakota’s legislators and governor adopted a law banning the use of a legal process known as eminent domain to acquire land access for carbon dioxide pipelines. South Dakota regulators also rejected Summit’s project application, saying there was no path forward for the project under the eminent domain ban.
Those moves came after several years of anti-pipeline activism by landowners focused on property rights and the danger from potential leaks of toxic carbon dioxide plumes. The project has permits in other states, but some of those are being challenged in court.
Congressional Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move a budget package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. The House recently passed its version of the bill without a repeal of the 45Q tax credits. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, voted for the bill.
A spokesperson for Johnson sent a statement when asked via email if the congressman supports repealing the tax credits: “While Dusty wished the reconciliation bill was more conservative, he voted in favor of it when it passed the House. We’ll see what the Senate passes.”
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, said Rounds met with a group of South Dakota lawmakers when they traveled to D.C. to voice opposition to the 45Q tax credits.
“Senator Rounds has long held the belief that many industry specific tax credits should not be perpetual, a belief which this group of landowners shares,” the statement said. “However, he has not had a chance to hear details of President Trump’s interest in this program. While many in South Dakota may oppose 45Q, it has been a popular proposal for other states for almost two decades and was included in the House-passed reconciliation bill.”
The office of Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, did not respond to South Dakota Searchlight’s request for his position.

(Courtesy of attorney general office)Last fall, thousands of businesses and charities received bills that appeared to be from the state of Washington.
Many recipients obliged, sending payments totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars in response to the state’s “Corporations & Charities Division.”
While that agency exists within the secretary of state’s office, the letters were part of a fraud and money laundering scheme carried out by a former postal worker arrested this week, according to an indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle. 
Johnny Nguyen faces 11 counts of mail fraud and money laundering. The San Jose, California, man was arrested Tuesday in northern California.
Nguyen, 49, sent the letters with billing statements on fake Washington state government letterhead, according to the indictment. The notices said payment was required for business and nonprofit filing fees. One example tells a business it owes $230, well beyond what the state charges.
The official-looking letters directed victims to send checks payable to “Business Entities” to post office boxes he’d rented, including in Olympia. Months earlier, Nguyen formed a company in California under that name, according to the charges.
On top of 350 checks worth $82,000 from Washington, the defendant deposited another 60 from California totaling $8,600, prosecutors allege. The indictment calls for Nguyen to forfeit the more than $90,000 he is accused of receiving.
Investigators reportedly seized another 1,700 checks worth $395,000 before Nguyen could deposit them.
After receiving the money, Nguyen would make transactions trying to conceal its source, according to court documents.
After numerous complaints last year, the Washington secretary of state and attorney general’s offices warned businesses of the fraudulent letters.
“Washington businesses are a foundational aspect of our state and critical to our economy’s health,” Secretary of State Steve Hobbs said at the time. “Business owners deserve to feel protected and equipped with information to deny malicious attempts on their franchise.” 
Then-Attorney General Bob Ferguson identified a couple clues indicating this was a scam last year. One of the letters listed a Sacramento address on the letterhead. A QR code on the document also went to a .org website instead of a .gov address.
Businesses can verify their filing status on the secretary of state’s Corporations and Charities Filing System.
The secretary of state also lists tips on its website to help businesses identify fraudulent solicitations. The U.S. attorney’s office in Seattle suggests calling the agency that sent the communication using a phone number on its website to verify its legitimacy.
Nguyen is scheduled to appear in court July 1.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/f3d866a3-dadd-0800-ebd7-52f1c5d03805-scaled-e1733442700108-1024x609.jpg,,,2025-06-18 20:03:15.119840

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The U.S. Supreme Court sided with Utah and Oklahoma on Wednesday in a case that started over disagreements with the Clean Air Act, and evolved into a debate over where certain lawsuits could be heard. 
The high court issued a unanimous opinion in Oklahoma v. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday, ruling that local courts can hear objections to federal air quality laws, rather than defer to courts in Washington D.C. 
The case stems from a 2015 decision by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, that made air quality standards for ozone more strict. 
Ozone pollution happens when nitrogen oxides react with volatile organic compounds, often called VOCs, according to the EPA. Essentially, when pollutants from cars, refineries, boilers and other sources of emissions react to sunlight and hot temperatures, ground-level ozone forms.
Ozone pollution can be common in Utah, especially during summer months. It’s been linked to a number of health issues, causing respiratory problems and even intellectual disabilities, according to a recent study from the University of Utah. 
States were required to submit plans outlining their compliance with the new ozone standards, which included how they would adhere to the Clean Air Act’s “good neighbor” provision — essentially, how the state would try to reign in emissions that might impact air quality in other states.

The EPA rejected plans put forward by 21 states, including Utah and Oklahoma, which sued the agency in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Colorado. But the EPA argued the lawsuits should be heard in a Washington D.C. Circuit Court, since its rule disapproving of the state air quality plans constituted a “single, nationally applicable action.” 
The Colorado court complied — but Utah and Oklahoma disagreed, instead taking the issue of jurisdiction to the Supreme Court. 
And in Wednesday’s opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, the court agreed, handing the case back to the 10th Circuit in Colorado. 
“These two disapprovals are undisputedly locally or regionally applicable actions. A (state implementation plan) is a state-specific plan, so an EPA disapproval on its face applies only to the State that proposed the (state implementation plan),” Thomas wrote. 
In a statement, Utah Attorney General Derek Brown celebrated the ruling, describing it as a win for Utah. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The Court agreed with Utah’s argument involving the Clean Air Act that local courts should handle local issues, and the federal government should collaborate with the states — not ignore their unique differences,” Brown said. “We are also grateful to the Trump Administration’s EPA for reconsidering its ruling that required litigation in the first place, and look forward to our continued partnership on behalf of Utah.” 
In March, the Trump administration announced it would reconsider the good neighbor provision, calling it “troubled.” The EPA said it would work with states whose implementation plans were initially rejected by the Biden administration’s EPA, including Utah.  
Justice Samuel Alito did not take part in the decision. According to SCOTUSblog, Alito owns stock in a company that was also challenging the EPA’s good neighbor provision.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/120624_Air-Quality_15-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 20:03:15.119840

A lightning-caused wildfire west of Pinedale was burning across more than 1,300 acres Wednesday, and largely uncontained. Though the blaze is sizable for this time of year, two officials told WyoFile it wasn’t an early indicator of a difficult fire season.
The post Wyoming Range wildfire’s considerable size doesn’t portend extreme season, officials say app[...]","A wildfire burning in the Wyoming Range due west of Pinedale grew to more than 1,300 acres as of Wednesday afternoon, five days after a lightning strike ignited it.
Though the fire is sizable for the time of year, a U.S. Forest Service spokesperson and the Wyoming State Forester told WyoFile the blaze wasn’t an early indicator of a difficult fire season. Instead, they attributed the fire’s growth to a bounty of dead and downed trees in that part of the Wyoming Range, and to the area’s high elevation — where conifer trees and other plants have not loaded up as heavily with moisture for a spring “green up” as they have in Wyoming’s valleys and plains. 
Dubbed the Horse Fire, the conflagration has not shown extreme fire behavior or made any big, dramatic runs that can quickly increase a fire’s size, Bridger-Teton National Forest spokesperson Mary Cernicek said. The fire has forced the closure of portions of several forest service roads in the area, including Horse Creek Road, both for public safety and because they’re seeing heavy use from firefighters and equipment. 

Firefighters also wrapped a historic fire lookout post on Prospect Peak with a layer of the material used in fire shelters — a mix of aluminum and other materials that firefighters will cover themselves in as a last resort when trapped by the flames. Other than the lookout, there does not appear to be any significant threat to structures. 
The fire is burning in an area of conifer forests and meadows, at an elevation where there are still a few patches of snow on the ground, Cernicek said. But the flames have grown in intensity most afternoons alongside the winds, she added. The area is currently listed as at moderate fire danger, but on June 13, the day the fire ignited, that segment of the national forest was listed as in low fire danger. 
But that doesn’t mean fires won’t start and grow. “The misconception is if it’s low fire danger, there’s no chance of fire,” Cernicek said, but “it started in just perfect conditions,” for a fire, even if the danger for rapid spread was low overall. 
There are 208 people working on the fire, including hot shot crews, helicopters and fire engines, according to the Horse Fire Inciweb page – Inciweb is a government website where fire updates are posted throughout the year. The approach is “full suppression,” Cernicek said, “and it has been since the beginning.” Tough terrain and thick downed trees have made firefighters’ job challenging and led to a strategic suppression strategy, she said. As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, Inciweb only listed 6% of the fire’s perimeter as contained.
Because it’s early season and the West isn’t confronting large or dangerous wildfires yet, plenty of personnel and resources are available, Cernicek said. 
Early spring and fall fires are common in the mountains of western Wyoming, State Forester Kelly Norris told WyoFile. Worse fires come in the fall, when spring’s new growth dries out and becomes combustible. A June wildfire “is typical and is going to continue to be typical in that area just because of the amount of dead trees we have in those forests,” Norris said. 
She expected an aggressive response to the Horse Fire. “It’s not the easiest place to go full suppression … but our expectation is for firefighters to make a point to put that out,” she said.

So far, weather and fuel modeling at this point in the year suggest an average wildfire season for Wyoming, Norris said. But as Wyomingites know, high winds and drying weather can change a fire season’s projection in an instant. 
“We were to have an average fire season last year too, and that didn’t turn out as expected,” Norris said.
Wyoming had a record-breaking, and state bank account-draining, fire season in 2024. Wildfires burned across 840,000 acres in grasslands and mountains across the state, a season surpassed only by the famous 1988 fires in Yellowstone National Park. About half of last year’s acreage burned in four big fires in the northeastern part of the state in late August. 
Once again this year, the northeastern corner of the state, stretching into the Bighorns, is predicted to have a higher-than-normal fire risk come August and September, Norris said. Modeling predicts high temperatures and reduced precipitation later in summer, despite a rainy May and June across the grasslands. Spring grass fires are also not unusual, she noted, but Wyoming has not seen any so far this year.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

Charles Dalzell, 46, of St. Thomas, made his initial appearance by video from the Grand Forks County jail before Magistrate Judge Alice Senechal at the federal courthouse in Fargo.
Dalzell and his attorney, public defender Rhiannon Gorham, requested an immediate hearing to determine if he could be released while awaiting trial on charges of making interstate threats to injure another person and threatening to assault, kidnap or murder a United States official.

In making the case that Dalzell should stay in jail, Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Lee said Dalzell had recently gone to the Pembina County Sheriff’s Office to retrieve a gun that had been confiscated from him in connection with another case. 
“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that he’s going to the sheriff’s office to retrieve a firearm,” Lee said. 
Dalzell is accused of sending a threatening email Sunday to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in North Dakota that references the shooting death of a Minnesota state representative. 
“I don’t want this situation to end up like Minnesota over the weekend,” Dalzell wrote, according to the criminal complaint in the case. 
Lee said investigators found methamphetamine and a machete at Dalzell’s property after Dalzell was arrested Monday. 
Senechal cited the seriousness of the charges, the information from Lee and Dalzell’s criminal history in ordering that Dalzell remain in custody. 
Dalzell responded by begging the judge to allow him to visit his mother, who he says is dying of cancer. 
“Let me say goodbye to my mother,” an emotional Dalzell asked the judge. “I want to tell her I love her.” 
Senechal declined to change her order. 
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

The complaint says Dalzell initially contacted the U.S. Attorney’s Office in February 2024 raising concerns about an attorney he hired to assist him with a property issue. Dalzell indicated in the 2024 email he was considering violence against the individual, according to court filings.
FBI agents in February warned him that his emails were “borderline threatening” and that it is against the law to threaten people over the internet, the complaint says.
In Sunday’s email — addressed to a U.S. Attorney’s Office employee whom court records identify as “J.P.” — Dalzell claims he was being ignored by federal and state officials, law enforcement and a judge.
Dalzell on Wednesday said Gov. Kelly Armstrong was “breaching his oath of office.” 
Dalzell maintained that he is not a threat to anyone. 
He said the gun was taken from him in relation to a disorderly conduct case. He said he only swore at a group of juveniles and the gun was not involved, but was taken away.
Dalzell’s criminal history also includes other convictions for disorderly conduct, as well as criminal mischief and domestic violence, court records show.

In the 15 years since the famous “Citizens United” court case, which opened the floodgates for more spending in political races, the amount of money spent on federal elections has increased 2,800%.
Former U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana who was unseated by Republican Tim Sheehy, outspent his opponent in 2024 and still lost, with estimates of the single Senate seat race spending totaling $275 million — without a primary election challenger.
When Tester first ran for the Senate in 2006, the primary and general election spending was $27.5 million.
As spending in politics has continued to balloon, leaders in Montana, spurred on by former Commissioner of Political Practice Jeff Mangan, have kicked off an initiative to put a new idea forward for curbing the influence of dark money in politics. Dark money is a term used where corporations or organizations don’t have to disclose their donors or their gifted amounts, making it nearly impossible to tell who is involved in some political campaigns.
The idea, called the “Transparent Election Initiative,” would be a state constitutional amendment that would simply prohibit corporations from making political campaign donations, using the state’s power to control how corporations operate in the state. Mangan kicked off the initiative in a call with reporters on Wednesday.
While the organizers of the initiative have not released the text of the amendment, which they say is still being drafted and perfected, the idea is simple: Corporations doing business in Montana would be barred from spending money on political campaigns. However, individuals would still be free to donate as the law allows.
Former Gov. Marc Racicot, a Republican governor who was at one time chairman of the Republican National Committee, is supporting the measure, as well as Tester, because of its straightforward approach. Racicot, who also served as the state’s attorney general, explained that the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives states the right to regulate commerce and corporations that do business in the state. Therefore, by simply making it illegal for any corporation to spend on political campaigns, Racicot said the state is exercising the power the federal government gives each state to regulate commerce.
The organizers of the initiative admit they may face a United States Supreme Court that has seemed to give increasing power to corporations and has equated the power to spend money freely as a part of protected political speech, but they said the high court cannot avoid the constitution’s power given to the states to regulate commerce. Furthermore, Mangan, who is also an attorney, and Racicot, argued that while corporations enjoy some of the same protections as individuals, there is a host of things corporations cannot do. That includes voting or sitting on juries.
Mangan said the genesis for the idea is nonpartisan: Residents are fed up with how much money is being spent on campaigns, the flooding of media and mailboxes with attack ads, and no transparency when it comes to identifying groups behind the messages.
“States have always had the ability to limit the corporations in their states, they have just chosen not to,” Mangan said.
He said states can revoke or modify the charters that allow corporations to operate within their borders, and this would be just one example of limiting their scope of business.
At one time, Montana had some of the strictest campaign laws in the country, and a history of grass-roots efforts to fight against corporations and wealthy individuals when it came to campaigning, based upon its checkered past when copper and gold mining magnates ran roughshod over the politics of the state. More than a century ago, Montana established the Corrupt Practices Act which barred certain political activities. However, many of those same laws fell after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision because the high court ruled in a 5-to-4 split decision that spending money to support causes or candidates amounted to political speech, which is protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution. Since then, organizations and leaders have tried to re-establish campaign laws, with little success.
Tester said that states like Montana will have to take the lead on these initiatives because Congress — the very body that could make the changes — is too tied to the funding and money raised by dark money and corporations.
“The notion that Congress will do something about this is foolish,” Racicot said.
Tester said the issue of taking money out of politics appeals to citizens, regardless of party affiliation.
“Not once during my time in the Senate did someone say to me, ‘You know what? We need to spend more on campaigns,’” Tester said.
Mangan said when trying to figure out how to reform the election system while respecting the U.S. Supreme Court, they went back to the future, so to speak, borrowing a power from when states had to push back against large corporate interests, like railroads.
“I am almost shocked this hasn’t been done before,” Racicot said. “And it’s important no person’s rights are being restrained. It’s profoundly simple: The state gives corporations power in the first place. In this case, you’re just telling them they don’t have the power to spend money like this in the first place.”
“Montana has a long history of standing up against corruption in politics,” said Sarah Haan, a professor at Washington & Lee University’s School of Law. “Now it is taking the lead with a powerful new solution: Treat electioneering as a state-conferred power, not an intrinsic right. The Montana Plan restores democratic accountability to the people without treading on anyone’s speech.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1380958948-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 20:03:15.119840

(Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images)Gov. Patrick Morrisey celebrated a decision from the United States Supreme Court released on Wednesday that upholds a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors.
The decision in U.S. v. Skrmetti overturned a lower court’s previous finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent the case to the high court.
The court ruled 6-3 on Wednesday that children who seek such treatment don’t qualify as a protected class. Since they are not being denied the medications due to their sex, barring the treatments is not discrimination. 
In a statement, Morrisey said he is “optimistic” that the ruling from the nation’s highest court will allow West Virginia to enforce its “common sense law” that bars trans children from playing on sports teams that match their gender identity.
That law was passed under Gov. Jim Justice in 2021. In May 2021, the West Virginia arm of the American Civil Liberties Union along with Lambda Legal filed a lawsuit, B.P.J. vs. the West Virginia Board of Education, against the state challenging the law. The ACLU and Lambda Legal were representing Becky Pepper-Jackson, who was 12 years old at the time and who would have been kicked off of her middle school track team if the law was enforced.
The U.S. Court of Appeals in February 2023 blocked the state from removing Pepper-Jackson from her school’s track and field team as legal advocates appealed a lower court’s ruling upholding the ban. Two months later, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a request from Morrisey — acting then as the state’s attorney general — to overturn the lower courts decision and enforce the law by removing Pepper-Jackson from her track team.
In April 2024, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the state’s law, saying it violated transgender students’ rights under Title IX, a federal civil rights law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in education programs.
Following that ruling, Morrisey again asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case and review the state’s trans athlete ban.
In his statement Wednesday, Morrisey did not specify how he believed that the ruling on Tennessee’s gender-affirming care ban would support West Virginia’s legal fight against Pepper-Jackson. He said he was “grateful” for the ruling, which represented a “big step forward” toward removing the current injunction. 
This legislative session, lawmakers passed a near-total ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Senate Bill 299 closed loopholes left open in a previous bill that law allowed children diagnosed with severe gender dysphoria to receive medical therapy, including hormonal treatment, if they are considered at risk for self-harm or suicide.
Medical treatments for children with gender dysphoria can include prescribing certain hormones or hormone blockers, which delay the onset of puberty temporarily to stop the development of permanent physical characteristics that don’t match the child’s gender identity. 
Studies show these medical interventions are highly successful in preventing long term and serious psychological issues — including depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, which are already more common in transgender youth and adults than their cisgender peers.
The Women’s Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland — one of only a few remaining providers for gender-affirming care in the Mountain State — issued a statement Wednesday saying the Supreme Court’s decision “threatens access to essential, often life-saving care for transgender youth across the country.”
“By allowing this cruel and discriminatory law to stand, the Court has set a dangerous precedent, one that could further erode access to critical health care and embolden states to escalate their attacks on trans communities,” said Danielle Maness, interim executive director for the clinics. “At the Women’s Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland, we remain resolute … We will not back down. We will keep showing up for a future in which bodily autonomy is the right of every Appalachian.”
Maness said the clinics will continue to provide gender-affirming care to adults in West Virginia and to children in Maryland.
“We do this because each of us deserves the right to make decisions about our bodies, futures and care with dignity and support,” Maness continued.
According to a 2024 survey by the LGBTQ advocacy nonprofit The Trevor Project, 51% of trans and non-binary children in West Virginia considered suicide in the previous year while 16% of them attempted suicide. 
Nationwide, states that have implemented bans on gender-affirming care for children have seen a significant increase in suicide attempts by transgender and gender nonconforming teenagers in the years following those bans taking effect. 
Doctors warned West Virginia lawmakers during the session that if SB 299 were to become law, they will likely see an increase in anxiety, depression and suicide among the state’s trans and nonbinary children.
That possibility will now occur as the Trump Administration also on Wednesday made cuts to the national 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, ending specialized suicide prevention services for LGBTQ+ youth.

“Our investigations division, they’re running with a standard investigation, just like we would do with any similar such incident, just to investigate if there’s anything that could have gone better or not,” said Lt. Matt Naylor, public affairs officer for the Coast Guard sector covering Southeast Alaska.
“Thankfully, nobody appeared to be injured. There didn’t appear to be any significant damage, so they’re going to be proceeding forward with that investigation, and we’ve gotten some videos from the public already, which have been super helpful,” he said.
On Monday, a sudden storm prompted the National Weather Service to issue the first-ever severe thunderstorm warning for Alaska’s capital city.
High winds and heavy rain hit Juneau’s port, where the cruise ship Celebrity Edge was moored at the AJ Dock, a privately owned facility.
Videos taken by local residents and shared on social media appear to show the ship breaking its moorings and being blown toward the Carnival Luminosa, another cruise ship moored in the middle of the port.
The Edge’s drift stops only when it drops anchor in the middle of the port, halting it short of the Luminosa, which later maneuvers further away and leaves the port.
The Edge later returned to shore without incident.
After the near-miss, the Coast Guard put out a call on local social media, asking for additional videos. Thanks to local residents, it no longer needs videos, Lt. Naylor said.
“At this point, we’ve gotten tons of submissions,” he said.
Naylor was unable to say on Tuesday how long the Coast Guard’s investigation will take.
“We’re grateful for everybody who has submitted videos to us, and we are especially grateful that this did not end up being anything bigger than it was, with no injuries and no significant damage,” he said.
“That’s what we’re the most grateful for, and we’re grateful to the crews of all the ships that were involved for their fast action.”

(Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Costly and unequal access to health care draw down the overall ranking of Kansas’ health system in nationwide evaluations of successes and failures.
Kansas has one of the lowest-performing state health systems in the country, ranking 33rd, according to the Commonwealth Fund’s 2025 Scorecard on State Health System Performance, which was released Wednesday.
However, two key metrics — uninsured rates and the number of adults forgoing medical care because of cost — have both improved in Kansas and across the country in the past decade. Kansas’ uninsured rate dropped from 17.5% in 2013 to 11.9% in 2023. The number of Kansas adults who said they went without care at least once because of cost decreased from 13.6% of adults in 2013 to 11% in 2023.
But those gains are at risk, said David Radley, senior scientist for the organization.
“The Congressional Budget Office estimates that legislation currently making its way through Congress would allow the premium tax credits to expire and to make it harder for low-income people to maintain their Medicaid coverage,” he said at a Tuesday media briefing.
 


&&    
 
Nine of the 10 states that haven’t expanded Medicaid, including Kansas, scored worse than the national average, according to the fund’s performance measures.
Disparities are expected to increase as federal changes to Medicaid and marketplace subsidies loom. States that haven’t expanded Medicaid, including Kansas, are still likely to see significant detrimental impacts, particularly in the marketplace, if cuts proceed.
Thirty-three percent of low-income Kansans younger than 65 pay high out-of-pocket costs for care, which increased from 29% in 2019, the scorecard found.
Black Kansans are at least three times as likely to die early from preventable and treatable causes as other racial groups. In every state, avoidable premature deaths among Black residents were elevated, but Kansas’ rate is one of the worst. Overall, Kansas’ health system underperforms for Black residents, the scorecard found. 
Sara Collins, senior scholar and vice president of the fund, said she fears federal changes could cause states to backtrack. States already struggling could fall even further behind, she said.
“Federal policy changes, both underway and proposed,” Collins said, “threaten to reverse the improvements achieved by states, exacerbate areas of slippage, and deepen geographic income and racial and ethnic disparities and health outcomes.”
The Affordable Care Act, which allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to low-income adults, was put in place because not everyone had health insurance through an employer, Collins said. Expanded Medicaid and marketplaces subsidies were ways to address that gap, which encompassed 49 million people who lacked health insurance, she said.
“And as we make it harder for people to access both of those, we’re likely to see people just becoming uninsured because the reality is they still won’t have access to employer-based coverage,” she said.
According to a separate analysis from the Commonwealth Fund, an estimated 66,000 people in Kansas will become uninsured in the next decade if Congress allows the extra premium tax credits that subsidize health plans on the marketplace to expire.
Based on 2023 data, the scorecard ranked Kansas 35th for health care access and affordability and 50th in income disparity.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2176362473-scaled-1-1024x618.jpg,,,2025-06-18 19:05:50.249212

Melissa Hortman talks to colleagues during a special legislative session Monday, June 9, 2025 at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)On the last scheduled day of the legislative session, amid contentious debate on the state budget, House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) stepped down from the rostrum to introduce a resolution expressing condolences to the members of the Minnesota Legislature for the deaths of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman.
The Hortmans were shot early Saturday morning in an apparent political assassination. Another Minnesota lawmaker, Democratic Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife were also shot multiple times, though survived with injuries.
“Sometimes the bad things that happen in our nation and our world can feel distant and maybe hollow, as just another headline in the news,” Fecteau said. In this case, however, it was a headline about someone I knew, someone I served with, and someone who I appreciated so much for her leadership, her tenacity, and just her general good spirit.”
Fecteau got to know Hortman, who previously served as Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, while serving on the board of the Democratic Leadership Campaign Committee, a national group focused on electing Democrats to state government. 
The comments came shortly after the chamber held an intense debate over the state budget proposal, and followed months of fighting and acrimony between some members over several contentious issues, including Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn)’s censure for sharing personal details about a transgender teen on her legislative Facebook page.
Minutes before, Rep. Laurie Osher (D-Orono) presented a seperate resolution in recognition of Pride Month and shared how she had received death threats for her work on issues related to LGBTQ+ rights. 
Since the shooting in Minnesota, Maine has removed lawmakers’ home addresses from the Legislature’s website.
Rumors have spread online about the motive of Hortman’s alleged killer, Vance Boelter, though interviews with people who knew him as well as reporting reveal a record of anti-abortion and LGBTQ+ sermons and beliefs. 
Fecteau went on to say that he “can’t help but think about the division that continues to worsen here in our nation, the inflamed rhetoric, which is less and less about the issues we debate in this chamber every day, and more and more about how certain leaders are inherently evil, because of their party affiliation, policy position, or both.” 
He said hopes that what people take from this tragedy is “that we cannot continue to normalize this contempt we have for each other. This contempt that we have for another party, and that we will not normalize political violence in this nation.”
The resolution was adopted in the Senate without discussion and in the House after several members of both parties expressed similar sentiments and, in a few cases, other personal experiences with Hortman.
Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) explained that she is originally from Minnesota and when she was weighing whether to run for speaker, was told to reach out to Hortman, who she said took the time to talk to her and give her advice.
“I think the greatest thing I’ve learned from being in this House is how easy it is to reach across the aisle, how easy it is to make friends, and I’m very appreciative for that,” Roeder added.
House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor), who did not know Hortman, said that we as a nation must “dial down the political rhetoric.” 
“Political disagreements are part of democracy, but hatred, violence and dehumanization have no place in public life,” Faulkingham said. “It’s time to do better for the memory of Speaker Hortman and all victims of political violence.”

Last year, 12% of respondents in Quebec told the Canadian Automobile Association that they intend to visit the U.S. this summer. This year, it’s just 4%.

Hill Farmstead has always had a hardcore contingent of Canadian fans. But even the award-winning brewery is facing boycotts from Quebecers frustrated with the Trump Administration. 
Nestled in the hills of the Northeast Kingdom in Greensboro, just a few dozen miles from the northern border, Hill Farmstead has proved a must-stop destination for cross-border beer lovers passing through the area.
“For our 15 years, we’ve had a huge, huge Canadian following, particularly with our friends from Montreal,” said Bob Montgomery, Hill Farmstead’s director of brand quality. 
In recent months, though, as President Donald Trump has inflamed tensions between the U.S. and Canada with his volatile tariff policies and threatening rhetoric, a mass movement to avoid the U.S. has taken hold in Canada, and the steady flow of visitors from up north has noticeably slowed. 
Since March, Canadians have accounted for 25-30% less traffic on the brewery’s website than they usually do, Montgomery said. And some Canadians who had purchased tickets for the brewery’s sold out 15th Anniversary Celebration have said that they won’t be coming and are even attempting to resell their tickets en masse. 
“Given the current circumstances, they’ve been choosing not to visit the United States and to spend their money at home instead,” Montgomery said.
President Donald Trump first sparked outrage among Canadians in February, when he imposed tariffs on most Canadian imports, a plan he has since adjusted and paused a handful of times. At the same time, he has made repeated rhetorical jabs at Canada, including threats to turn it into “the 51st state.” 
Canada responded by hitting U.S. imports with retaliatory tariffs, and a number of Canadian provinces have pulled American products from their shelves. 
But even as the tariff tit-for-tat has largely burned itself out, with both countries having repealed or delayed many of the levies they initially declared, a grassroots movement to boycott American goods and avoid travel to the U.S. has persisted in Canada, more inspired by Trump’s rhetoric and personality than his policies.

By the numbers
According to a recent survey from the Canadian Automobile Association—the Canadian equivalent of AAA—only 4% of Quebecers intend to visit the U.S. this summer, compared with 12% of survey respondents who said they planned to do so in 2024.
“Some Quebecers are just boycotting the United States while Trump is president,” said Shanny Hallé, a spokesperson for Tourism Eastern Townships. “There’s a message they’re sending that they want to keep their money here.”
The impacts of the boycott have been especially stark in Vermont, particularly in the northernmost parts of the state, where many towns and businesses that hug the northern border rely on Canadian tourism for much of their revenue.

About 750,000 Canadians visit Vermont each year, contributing about $150 million to the state’s economy, according to data from the Vermont Department of Tourism and Marketing. And although Canadians account for about 5% of tourists statewide, visitors from up north account for over 30% of visitors to the northernmost counties. 
As peak summer season approaches, the loss is already being felt. 
Canadian reservations at hotels and inns across the state have decreased by up to 45% since February, said Kim Donahue, president of the Vermont Lodging Association. And according to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation, border crossings from Canada into Vermont have plummeted in recent months. In March and April, roughly 30% fewer people crossed over into the U.S. by car than did at the same time last year.
Canadians usually represent roughly half of yearly visitors at Jay Peak Resort, according to president and general manager Steve Wright. In recent months, however, Wright said that the resort has seen a sharp decline in visitors from Canada, a trend he projects to continue through the year.

Located just south of the border, the Northeast Kingdom ski resort has for decades accepted Canadian currency at par with the U.S. dollar, a strong lure for Canadians, who can buy ski lift passes and waterpark admission tickets at a one-to-one exchange rate.
But according to Wright, ski season pass sales to Canadians for the upcoming winter are down about 35% from previous years.
Jay Peak is also home to an indoor ice rink, the venue for year-round youth hockey tournaments and camps that take place on an almost weekly basis. Of the 300 Canadian teams that usually participate in total, though, the resort is projecting that about half as many will show up this year.
“The amount of Canadian business that is on the books this year is about 50% off from where it should be,” Wright said.  
Jay Peak has also seen widespread cancellations from Canadians who had bookings at its golf course, he said.
In recent weeks, Wright has personally spoken to dozens of Canadian customers who have chosen to steer clear of the resort this year, most of whom cited Trump’s rhetoric in explaining their decision.

“I think that, in combination with everything else, is giving Canadians pause as they plan their summer and fall and winter vacations,” Wright said.
Abby Long, executive director of Kingdom Trails, said that she’s had similar conversations with longtime patrons who have decided to boycott the fabled mountain bike trail network this year.
“Earlier this year, we were definitely getting daily emails and Facebook messages from our Canadian friends who said, ‘We’ve come for years to Kingdom Trails. Please know we love the trails, but we won’t be visiting this summer,’” Long said. 
Currently, she said, just 12% of visitors to Kingdom Trails are Canadians, who represented about 24% of patrons at the same time last year. 
“We love our Canadian friends,” she said. “It’s really disheartening.”

Rebuilding bridges
As Canadian tourism continues to decline heading into the peak summer season, Vermont businesses and state officials have started extending olive branches to their counterparts in the north with the hopes of enticing Canadians to return to the Green Mountains.
On Monday, Gov. Phil Scott met with the leaders of other New England states and the premiers of five Canadian provinces in Massachusetts to discuss ways of thawing tensions, although it’s unclear what concrete steps, if any, were agreed upon. A few hours later, the Burlington City Council voted to temporarily rename Church Street “Canada Street” for the summer. 
Last week meanwhile, tourism leaders from northern Vermont traveled to Quebec for the inaugural meeting of the Cross Border Tourism Alliance, which was held at Léon Courville Vigneron, a winery in Fulford.
“We realize it’s a tricky time to be in tourism and hospitality right now, but Quebec and Vermont have always been close,” said Jeff Lawson, vice president of tourism for Hello Burlington, which put together the event. “It was sort of an opportunity to commiserate over the situation a bit.”
The new group hopes to hold meetings twice a year, a practice that Lawson hopes will foster longer term relationships, even if Canadians continue to boycott the U.S. for the foreseeable future.  
“Very few of us on either side of the border knew each other even though we’re miles apart,” Lawson said. “We’re trying to do our best to establish and maintain new connections.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A retired Douglas County District Court judge will be the next member of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission and jointly serve on the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission.
Gov. Jim Pillen on Wednesday announced the six-year appointment of former District Judge J. Michael Coffey of Omaha to the Liquor Commission. Coffey retired in June 2023 after nearly 25 years on the 4th Judicial District bench, currently only Douglas County. Coffey must be confirmed by the Legislature in 2026 to stay in his role.

Commissioners must draft licensing criteria for medical cannabis establishments by July 1 and begin awarding licenses by Oct. 1. The medical cannabis board’s next meeting is tentatively June 26. No agenda has yet been released.
Coffey, prior to former Gov. Ben Nelson appointing him to the district court in 1998, was a private attorney in Omaha. He earned his law degree from the Creighton University School of Law in 1974. 
He is a Vietnam War veteran, having served in the U.S. Army from 1969-1971.
A judicial oversight board in 2013 cleared Coffey of unethical behavior over a complaint from an ex-wife about how he had handled his daughter receiving a DUI conviction. The commission, in its report, wrote that a judge shouldn’t “lose his or her rights and responsibilities as a parent simply because he or she holds judicial office.”
The Nebraska State Bar Association, which Coffey served in leadership roles for, consistently recommended Coffey be retained in each of his local elections, in 2002, 2008, 2014 and 2020.
The Governor’s Office had no immediate answer about how many Nebraskans applied for the 2nd Congressional District vacancy on the Liquor Control Commission.
Pillen chose not to reappoint former Liquor Commissioner Harry Hoch, Jr., after Hoch’s term expired May 24. Pillen told the Nebraska Examiner it was “just time.” 
Hoch, who had 40 years of liquor industry knowledge, said Pillen’s chief of staff told him the governor wanted someone with more “cannabis experience.” 
Pillen’s announcement of Coffey did not mention the Medical Cannabis Commission. Coffey has presided over felony drug conviction cases or other cases involving marijuana, in addition to other legal experience.
Pointing to a phrase from former UCLA basketball Coach John Wooden, Pillen has said regulators must “be quick, but don’t hurry,” stating: “This is important we get it right.”
“We’re not going to become recreational [marijuana] as long as I’m your governor, like our state to the west,” Pillen said during his monthly call-in show Monday.

Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, listens to debate on the South Dakota Senate floor on Feb. 10, 2025. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight) Over 100 state and local officials from the Midwest and West, including South Dakota, are asking the U.S. Senate to eliminate tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration as part of a federal budget reconciliation bill.
Established by Congress and then-President George W. Bush in 2008, the 45Q tax credits incentivize companies to capture carbon dioxide from processes such as ethanol production and sequester it underground, so it won’t contribute to climate change by acting as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The carbon can also be sequestered as part of enhanced oil recovery, in which pressurized gas is used to push more oil to the surface.
Opponents say the credits don’t work as intended.
“The 45Q tax credits really only make sense to the industries that are poised to make billions of dollars from them,” said North Dakota state Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo. “They are supposedly intended to reduce carbon emissions, but in fact, 45Q tax credits pay polluters for polluting and subsidize private oil production at the expense of the taxpayer.”
South Dakota regulators deny carbon pipeline permit again, but company vows to reapply

Companies receive up to $85 per metric ton for regular sequestration and up to $60 per metric ton for sequestration via enhanced oil recovery — though there is a provision in a draft portion of the Senate reconciliation bill that would raise the maximum oil recovery credit to $85.
The repeal effort includes officials from Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. A few of those officials held a virtual press conference Wednesday. 
South Dakota state Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, described the tax credits as wasteful spending.
“We are concerned about preserving taxpayer dollars, and I guess that’s the main gist of our conference today,” Hohn said.
Mathern said repealing the tax credits would put projects like Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed five-state carbon dioxide pipeline “in dire danger.”
“And that’s really positive,” he said. 
Summit’s project alone could qualify for more than $1 billion annually from 45Q credits. It aims to capture some of the CO2 emitted by dozens of ethanol plants and ship the carbon via pipeline to a sequestration area southeast of the oilfields in western North Dakota.
Earlier this year, South Dakota’s legislators and governor adopted a law banning the use of a legal process known as eminent domain to acquire land access for carbon dioxide pipelines. South Dakota regulators also rejected Summit’s project application, saying there was no path forward for the project under the eminent domain ban.
Those moves came after several years of anti-pipeline activism by landowners focused on property rights and the danger from potential leaks of toxic carbon dioxide plumes. The project has permits in other states, but some of those are being challenged in court.

Congressional Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move a budget package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. The House recently passed its version of the bill without a repeal of the 45Q tax credits. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, voted for the bill.
A spokesperson for Johnson sent a statement when asked via email if the congressman supports repealing the tax credits: “While Dusty wished the reconciliation bill was more conservative, he voted in favor of it when it passed the House. We’ll see what the Senate passes.”
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, said Rounds met with a group of South Dakota lawmakers when they traveled to D.C. to voice opposition to the 45Q tax credits.
“Senator Rounds has long held the belief that many industry specific tax credits should not be perpetual, a belief which this group of landowners shares,” the statement said. “However, he has not had a chance to hear details of President Trump’s interest in this program. While many in South Dakota may oppose 45Q, it has been a popular proposal for other states for almost two decades and was included in the House-passed reconciliation bill.”

When Kimberly Terrell, a widely respected Tulane researcher and director of community engagement at the Environmental Law Clinic, recently resigned citing a “complete gag order,” it sent shockwaves through Louisiana and universities across the nation.
Emails and internal communications obtained by the Associated Press reveal a disturbing pattern: political and donor pressure — reportedly incited by powerful politicians — has led university leaders to mute research exposing racial and economic disparities in the petrochemical industry.










When universities permit political or financial interests to muzzle scholars, they betray their core mission: the free pursuit of knowledge.


Terrell’s work is data-driven, peer-reviewed, and courageous. Her study, published in Ecological Economics, showed what many communities have long suspected: in the heart of Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley,” Black residents shoulder the burden of pollution but are systematically excluded from the high-paying jobs that industrial development promises.
In parishes like St. John the Baptist, where 69% of the population is Black and education levels between Black and white residents are nearly equal, people of color remain vastly underrepresented in top-tier jobs. And yet, these same communities suffer the most from toxic emissions, high cancer rates, and declining air quality. It’s a lose-lose reality: no economic inclusion, and no environmental protection.
This isn’t conjecture; it’s rigorous empirical evidence. Good scholarship demands response, not repression.
Yet the response from some corners, which includes threats to Tulane’s state funding and warnings that her work threatens redevelopment projects, reframes academic research as a political liability. According to AP‐reported emails, the law clinic’s work “had become an impediment” to a downtown redevelopment project. Her research, in other words, was not faulty; it just could have stood in the way of more money.
Before resigning, Terrell had been barred from speaking to media, a stark example of institutional censorship. This is outrageous. When universities permit political or financial interests to muzzle scholars, they betray their core mission: the free pursuit of knowledge. Academic freedom is not a luxury — it is the very bedrock of institutional integrity.
Tulane’s reputation and independence now hinge upon its response. It must unequivocally affirm that the Environmental Law Clinic has the full support of university leadership. That includes restoring researchers’ and professors’ ability to speak, release peer-reviewed studies, and contribute meaningfully to public debate. If the university fails to do so, it risks signaling to current and future faculty that inconvenient facts can be smothered if they cross powerful interests. It risks becoming a research-by-permit institution where only politically palatable findings see the light of day.
This is not an isolated event in Louisiana. Earlier this year, LSU’s Professor Ken Levy, a tenured constitutional law scholar, was suspended after making pointed—and vulgar—remarks critical of top elected officials. His removal triggered fierce backlash, court battles, and a prolonged debate over whether political pressure now overrides academic norms.
Meanwhile, even LSU’s flagship research centers have faced scrutiny for allowing oil companies to appoint seats on research boards, raising concerns about corporate influence on academic inquiry.
Together, these cases form an alarming pattern: politicized pressure from state officials aimed at shaping curriculum, constraining speech and influencing university behavior. In Terrell’s case, the university has acted pre-emptively to shield itself from criticism — effectively punishing academic rigor.
The moral and academic cost? Communities in Cancer Alley remain underrepresented, unheard, and polluted — while the researchers working to shine a light on their plight are silenced. That outcome dishonors both Tulane and Louisiana’s promise to provide environmental justice.
Civic leaders, alumni, faculty, students, and citizens concerned with justice must stand with the Environmental Law Clinic — and call on Tulane’s leadership to do the same. If we fail to defend those who expose inconvenient truths, we invite a future where the only “research” that thrives is the kind approved by political paymasters.
Terrell’s resignation is more than a personal protest; it is a red flag. Her rigorous, peer-reviewed findings must not be buried. Tulane must act now to safeguard academic freedom and the university’s independence, lest it trade its values for its position in the power structure.
The stakes are higher than a single study or appointment. They touch the core of what it means to pursue knowledge in a free society. Louisiana’s future depends on its ability to confront the realities of environmental and economic injustice — not by silencing the scientists who illuminate them, but by amplifying their findings and committing to change.
Academic institutions exist to challenge the status quo, not protect it. Tulane has the opportunity to reaffirm that mission. It must not squander it.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1599px-Tulane_University_4666851315-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-18 19:05:50.249212

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
As he prepares to leave his role next month, Vermont Progressive Party Executive Director John Wronski is reflecting on nearly a decade spent growing the state’s third-largest party — the work, the wins and the challenges that defined his tenure. 
Wronski announced last month he would leave his position on July 4 and join the staff of the Vermont State Employees’ Association, “one of the most impactful unions in our state,” he said. 
“I have a 2-year-old at home and am hoping to have another kid fairly soon, and it felt like a good time to make that switch,” Wronski told VTDigger this week. “It’s been a really good ride, but it was time to change things up a little bit. I’ve accomplished most of what I set out to do, I believe.”Wronski said he got his start in the Progressive Party while studying at Saint Michael’s College in Burlington, where he received a grant to do research on the party.“I was really fascinated by the work that the party was doing in Vermont,” he said.Wronski did several stints at larger unions across the country before returning to Vermont to take a position with the party, which would later turn into the executive director role.“I was, like, living out of a suitcase, traveling all over the state and the country … and I really wanted to kind of settle down permanently in Vermont. I was looking for work, and the elections director position opened up with the Vermont Progressive Party.”That role soon turned into an executive director position, making Wronski the only staff member for the Vermont Progressive Party until two years ago, when fundraising allowed for the hiring of a second.Wronski said his successes during his tenure included the election of Progressives into notable roles like former Lt. Gov. David Zuckerman and Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, building a Progressive presence in Barre and making notable fundraising gains.
But he noted that every win was part of a larger, shared effort.“Our movement is very much a collective effort, and anything that I’ve done has been with a huge team of people supporting that work,” he said.Reaching across the aisle is key for the party’s success, according to Wronski. He cited the death of a bill pushed by Vermont Democrats to end “fusion” candidates — candidates nominated by two parties — as an example, as Progressives worked with Republicans to stop it.
Wronski also spoke about the party’s failures during his time as director, the largest one being fundraising. The Progressives pride themselves on their grassroots fundraising, he said, but that can make larger monetary windfalls difficult.
“It’s perpetually a struggle, never figuring out how to grow our finances to the level where we could even compete on a two-to-one level with Democrats in most races,” Wronski said. “Our annual budget that was approved for this year is $120,000, which is like a pittance for a statewide organization.”
Long term, the party needs an annual budget of $200,000 or $300,000 to be sustainable, he said.
Wronski declined to say who would take over his position once he’s gone, but he did comment on who had the potential to be larger political players.“We have a few people on the city council level who are in their first terms in Burlington. Carter Newbezer, Marek Broderick … there’s a lot of potential for them to run for higher office in the near future,” he said. “Tanya Vyhovsky, who’s in the State Senate, is obviously a known entity at this point. But I could definitely see her making a jump for statewide office. We have people like Jane Stromberg, who was a city councilor at one point and had to step back. I could see her either running again or taking on a leadership position within the party.”Wronski also had advice for the party’s next director.“You have to surrender your ego,” he said. “That’s the best way I can say it. … You have to be willing and even excited to talk to folks both internally within the party and externally, like in the broader political sphere, who have different views on the way things should be.”

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A new spate of undercover seafood testing at restaurants in the Alexandria area found more than half of the sampled eateries serving imported shrimp. 
SeaD Consulting, a food testing company that has been making headlines for uncovering foreign-sourced shrimp sold as local catch at restaurants and festivals across the Gulf Coast, announced Wednesday that 54% of the Central Louisiana restaurants it sampled were serving imported shrimp – and several were lying to their customers about it.  
The company’s use of genetic testing found that 11 of the 24 restaurants sampled offered authentic Gulf of Mexico-caught shrimp, while the remaining 13 sold farm-raised shrimp to dinters. Six of those 13 restaurants, roughly 25% of the total, were serving imported fare in an “explicitly fraudulent” manner, meaning they claimed the shrimp was domestic when it wasn’t. 
SeaD collected the samples June 3-4 from restaurants across Alexandria and nearby Pineville. The findings are relatively on par with testing the company has conducted in other Louisiana cities. Its testing in the Shreveport area from March uncovered a 58% fraud rate. 
“This is about trust,” said Rodney Olander, chairman of the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force. “Alexandria is a proud river city with deep Louisiana roots, and its people deserve to know when they’re getting wild-caught Gulf shrimp — or when they’re being served imported farm-raised substitutes passed off as local. Having one in four restaurants being explicitly fraudulent is not right.”
In December, the Louisiana Shrimp Task Force, an advisory panel for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, asked SeaD Consulting to analyze shrimp from restaurants across the state in an effort to eliminate consumer seafood fraud. Its analysis includes sampling batches of 24 randomly selected restaurants in different cities across the state.
It is illegal under federal and state law to mislabel imported seafood as local and can result in fines or other penalties.
Local seafood was once easy to find in Louisiana, but an influx of cheap foreign catch – particularly shrimp and crawfish – has flooded the market over the past two decades. 
For more than a decade, Louisiana law has specifically required restaurants and other food establishments to state on their menus the country of origin of any shrimp and crawfish being served. The same requirement applies to food vendors at fairs and festivals. 
A 2023 review of state enforcement records revealed many restaurants had not complied with the law. State health inspectors issued thousands of citations to restaurants but levied no fines against them, drawing criticism from state lawmakers and local fishermen.
SeaD Consulting launched its testing efforts last year using undercover inspectors to purchase shrimp dishes from restaurants and festival vendors. The inspectors run the shrimp through a rapid field testing kit that examines seafood tissue genetics. 
SeaD’s investigation of the Louisiana Shrimp and Petroleum Festival in Morgan City led to public outrage when 4 out of 5 vendors there were found to have fraudulently served foreign shrimp. 
Dave Williams, a commercial fisheries scientist and founder of SeaD Consulting, said consumers can play an important role in combating seafood fraud. They should always ask restaurant staff where their seafood comes from, look for clear menu labeling indicating the country of origin and report suspicions of seafood fraud to local or state health officials, Williams said.
The company does not publicly disclose the names of the restaurants that fraudulently serve imported shrimp, opting instead to highlight businesses that are following the law and serve domestic shrimp. 
The Central Louisiana restaurants tested that offer locally caught seafood were:

Brocato’s Breakfast, Alexandria
Bucket’s Crawfish & Seafood, Pineville
Crawfish Port Inc., Alexandria
Crazy Cajun, Pineville
Deborge’s Crawfish, Alexandria, LA 71301
Koal’s Bar-B-Que, Alexandria
Pit Grill Diner, Alexandria
Red River Seafood & Sushi, Alexandria
Rosie Jo’s, Alexandria
Rotolo’s Craft & Crust, Alexandria
Swamp Daddy’s Crawfish, Alexandria

“These restaurants are doing it right,” Williams said. “They’re supporting the local economy and giving customers what they’re paying for — the flavor of Louisiana, from the docks to the table.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Senate Committee on Judiciary wasted no time Wednesday in advancing controversial legislation calling for a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault-style weapons for a floor vote.
In less than five minutes, the committee voted 8-6 to advance the amended legislation sponsored by Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, for consideration by the full chamber Friday, just in time for the tentative end of the 2025 legislative session.
DiPalma’s bill would prohibit the sale and manufacturing — but not the possession —  of assault-style shotguns, handguns, and rifles beginning July 1, 2026. Violators would face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 and would have to forfeit their weapons.
That mostly mirrors the companion legislation that passed the House June 5 by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat. DiPalma’s new bill does away with a voluntary weapon certification program, which itself was amended from a mandate that grandfathered weapons be registered with law enforcement — a provision that drew the ire of pro-Second Amendment advocates.
Joining the committee to ensure the bill’s passage were new Senate President Valarie Lawson and Majority Leader Frank Ciccone — who used their ex-officio roles to vote. Senate Republican leaders Jessica de la Cruz and Gordon Rogers voted against the measure.
“The bill prevents further sales, and I think that’s the most important piece here,” Lawson said in an interview on the Senate floor.
 



How the committee voted on the proposed assault weapons ban
YES: 
Senate President Valarie Lawson, an East Providence Democrat; Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, a Providence Democrat; Chairman Matthew LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat; Jacob Bissaillon; a Providence Democrat; John Burke, a West Warwick Democrat; Dawn Euer, a Newport Democrat; Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat; and Ana Quezada, a Providence Democrat
NO: 
Andrew Dimitri, a Johnston Democrat; Leonidas Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat; Thomas Paolino, a Lincoln Republican; Todd Patalano, a Cranston Democrat; Minority Whip Gordon Rogers, a Foster Republican; and Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz, a North Smithfield Republican
NOT PRESENT FOR THE VOTE: 
Majority Whip David Tikoian, a Smithfield Democrat 



The historic advancement to the floor drew dozens of gun safety and Second Amendment advocates into the third-floor committee room. But if they were hoping to hear any lively debate on the legislation, it didn’t happen — save for Sen. Leonaidas Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat who spoke in opposition to the bill.
“No form of a firearms ban is acceptable under the guise of making us safer, it’s ridiculous,” Raptakis said. “If anything, we are less safe because law-abiding citizens will not be able to buy weapons to keep themselves next year.”

Companion legislation that passed the House June 5 by Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, was held by the committee for further study. 
That means the fate of one of Gov. Dan McKee’s top legislative priorities lies squarely on whether the House plans to accept the revisions made across the rotunda. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi opted to withhold comment until the entire Senate considers the bill.
“The final bill is subject to change on the Senate floor, so it would be premature to comment at this time,” Shekarchi said in a statement.
Knight also declined to comment on the Senate’s Judiciary Committee’s action, but indicated he remains optimistic about his amended proposal.
“The session’s not over until it’s over,” Knight said in a phone call.
Questions remain on Senate proposal
Ciccone, a Providence Democrat and federally licensed firearms dealer who had opposed DiPalma’s original bill, said he was swayed to give his support following the changes made — namely the decision to no longer outlaw the possession of assault-style weapons.
“This has the ability to help our citizens and protects everyone,” Ciccone told reporters.
But in effect, that could allow someone to purchase a weapon in another state where such sales are legal. At least that’s the interpretation of Frank Saccoccio, president of the Rhode Island Second Amendment Coalition.
“That bill only covers Rhode Island purchases, not out-of-state,” Saccoccio said in an interview. “I still say it’s terrible — it will lead to a lot of confusion, a lot of people will not know how to comply.”
However, committee chairman Matthew LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat, told Rhode Island Current that federal law is clear in prohibiting firearm purchases across state lines.
“This is about reducing the number of available prohibited firearms in the current population,” he said. “Both bills would have done that, but this has a different spin on it.”
Gun safety advocates are split on whether the Senate’s proposal will achieve that goal.
Monisha Henley, senior vice president of government affairs for Everytown for Gun Safety, called the Senate’s rework “a massive step forward” in limiting access to assault-style firearms.
But the head of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence believes the legislation is just a weakened version of what was passed in the House.
“The bill that passed in the House was supported by advocates and organizations representing so many different constituencies, all five of our general officers, and local leaders across the state,” Executive Director Melissa Carden said in a statement Wednesday. “We also know that we must always be willing to compromise to make progress and the bill that passed the House is the result of that compromise – it also has majority support in the Senate.”
Sen. Dawn Euer, a Newport Democrat who voted to advance the bill, said she hopes the chamber will revise DiPalma’s bill on the floor to match its counterpart in the House.
“If they don’t, I am happy to bring up that amendment,” she said. “I think that is more reflective of the bill 24 senators sponsored.”
DiPalma said he understands advocates’ calls for stricter language, but “you can’t let the enemy of better be good enough.”
“And this bill maintains the nucleus of the bills that we had,” DiPalma said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Marva Johnson was approved Wednesday by the Board of Governors as the next president of Florida A&M University, the last confirmation needed on a search that’s been accompanied loudly by protests. 
Johnson is set to start Aug. 1 and will take the reins from Timothy Beard, who has served as interim president for the past year. 
“I want to acknowledge the significance of this moment and the responsibility that I will carry to preserve the legacy while carving a path forward for this institution,” Johnson said in her confirmation hearing during the Board of Governors meeting at Florida Atlantic University. 
  Marva Johnson via FAMU
FAMU alumni appeared at the meeting in Boca Raton, strongly opposing Johnson’s candidacy during an open forum that was limited to 15 minutes, turning away some members of the public. 
“I believe the dedicated 15-member search committee reflected our commitment to identifying candidates who possess the requisite qualities to advance Florida A&M University’s objectives,” FAMU Board of Trustees Vice Chair Deveron Gibbons said, to which the FAMU attendees groaned, causing BOG Chair Brian Lamb to tell them to stop. 
Johnson was appointed to boards by former Gov. Rick Scott and Gov. Ron DeSantis, prompting protesters’ concerns that she may prove a political president.
Those political fears were paired with a perceived lack of higher education experience and resulted in petitions and community events opposing her presidency and prolonged FAMU Board of Trustee meetings.
Johnson is a group vice president for Charter Communications and previously served as chair of the Florida Board of Education, which oversees K-12 education and the Florida College System.
Lamb advised Johnson to commit to keeping her door open. “The voices aren’t going to go away,” he said. 
He went on to ask FAMU Board of Trustees Chair Harper and Gibbons to commit to supporting Johnson during her presidency. 
“To the Rattler community, students, faculty, alumni, stakeholders, I am listening and I hear your hope and I hear your dreams and I hear your concerns, and my door will always be open, and I’m looking forward to full engagement on campus and in our communities,” Johnson said while looking at the FAMU community in the room. 
FAMU community members stood with their back turned to Johnson.

BOG members pointed to Johnson’s sticking with the process through the turmoil as a measure of resiliency. 
“This is a new era, not for retreat, but for bold leadership and advancement. This moment is not about dismantling, it is about building, it is about advancing excellence, and together we can take FAMU to a top 50 public university in America,” Johnson said. 
Johnson’s contract will provide total compensation of about $840,000 in the first year and rises to about $981,000 in the final year.
The Florida Legislature this week approved a one-year rule change to allow the FAMU board to use otherwise restricted funds to pay for Johnson’s contract after the FAMU Foundation expressed a hesitancy to fund her full contract.
Two more presidents
The Board of Governors also approved former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez as Florida International University president after she served as the school’s interim president. She was the sole finalist in a search that began when former President Kenneth Jessell stepped down.
Her contract will pay her a base salary of $925,000 and up to $400,000 in performance incentives. She will get a $245,000 annual retirement supplement, too, among other stipends.
The board approved Manny Diaz Jr. as the University of West Florida’s interim president. He will leave his job as the education commissioner of the state. 
His salary and benefits will pay him about $750,000, doubling his salary as education commissioner. 
Board member Eric Silagy said he thinks the search for a permanent president at UWF will be “undermined” by his contract. Silagy’s concern involved the lack of performance incentives and the ability for the university and Diaz to negotiate an interim extension if the search fails. 
“I think we’re going to end up with a failed search and we’re going to end up with Commissioner Diaz by default,” Silagy said. 
At FAU two years ago, the search was called off after now-U.S. Rep. Randy Fine was not named a finalist after DeSantis positioned him for the job. 
“I look forward to great things at UWF coming soon,” Diaz said.

In response, the department will hold vaccination clinics across the state.
The super-contagious disease is nearing a six-year record as outbreaks spread across the United States. According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 13, there are 1,197 confirmed cases affecting 34 states.
Measles cases are in 34 states with North Dakota now the focus

North Dakota reports the highest rate of any state at 34 cases. Reports of new cases in Texas, where the outbreak originated, may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more willing to vaccinate, experts say. 
The measles vaccine offers the best protection against infection, according to the South Dakota Health Department. 
“We encourage everyone to check their vaccination status and take advantage of these clinics, especially if they’re unsure of their immunity,” said Dr. Joshua Clayton, state epidemiologist, in a news release. 
The release did not say whether the clinics will charge for the vaccinations, or how much, and the department did not immediately respond to questions from South Dakota Searchlight.
South Dakota had a 91% vaccination rate among kindergarteners during the 2024-25 school year, according to state data, which was down from 96% before the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination coverage of 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission, according to medical professionals. 
The state has experienced lower vaccination rates in recent years as more parents claim religious exemptions allowed in state law. The counties with the worst measles, mumps and rubella vaccination rates among kindergarteners include Faulk (56%), Jones (60%), Hutchinson (64%) and Sanborn (66%). Fifteen counties report a vaccination rate at or above 95%.
One of the patients in the latest measles report visited the Rapid City Medical Center Urgent Care waiting room at 2820 Mount Rushmore Road from 9 to 11:30 a.m. on June 10 while infected. A press release from the Health Department did not say whether the new cases are among children or adults.
Measles symptoms appear in two stages, first with a runny nose, cough and slight fever. Second, occurring on the third to seventh day of the illness, a red blotchy rash appears and lasts for up to a week. The rash usually begins on the face. The person’s temperature also rises to 103-105 degrees Fahrenheit.

Smoke from two wildfires is worsening air quality across southern New Mexico. (Courtesy of Pinos Altos Volunteer Fire and Rescue)New Mexico health officials issued warnings Wednesday that wildfire smoke is worsening air quality across much of the southern part of the state.
Smoke from the Trout Fire near Silver City pushed more than 100 miles into the Rio Grande Valley across Las Cruces and El Paso on Tuesday night into Wednesday, worsening air quality, the New Mexico Department of Health said in a press release Wednesday. The Trout Fire has prompted evacuations as it has burned more than 38,000 acres in the Gila National Forest. It is  0% contained.
Pollution from wildfire smoke includes extremely small particulates that can be inhaled and worsen lung and heart conditions, even over short periods, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
How you can protect your community from wildfire smoke

While everyone’s health is affected, unhealthy air quality can have the greatest impacts on young children, adults over 65, pregnant women and people with heart or lung conditions, including asthma. The health department recommended reducing outdoor activity in areas with moderate to unhealthy air quality, shutting windows and doors and avoiding using swamp coolers, since they pull the air from outside directly into the house.
The Seven Springs Fire, which has burned an estimated 350 acres on Mescalero Apache Tribal land, is also worsening air quality in Mescalero, High Rolls, Cloudcroft and Alamogordo, health officials said.
The village of La Luz, south of the fire, is forecast to experience unhealthy air quality though Wednesday evening.

RUTLAND — A Vermont man who prosecutors say was behind a hacking operation used to steal personal information from tens of thousands of people has pleaded guilty to a federal criminal charge in Vermont.
Nicholas Moses, 34, of Newport, who also uses the online alias “scrublord,” entered his guilty plea Wednesday in federal court in Rutland to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud through the use of computers.
Judge Mary Kay Lanthier released Moses on conditions pending a sentencing hearing in October. The conditions prohibit him from leaving Vermont. 
Under a plea deal, Moses faces a maximum prison term of up to five years.
Moses operated a computer malware program known as SmokeLoader and used it “to harvest” data from victims, according to court filings. 
“Thousands of computers around the world have been infected with the SmokeLoader malware by Moses and over 65,000 victims have had their personal information and passwords stolen by Moses,” court records stated. 
The scheme played out between January 2022 and May 2023, according to court documents.
Moses maintained a server in the Netherlands to deploy the SmokeLoader data-stealing malware program on the computers of unsuspecting victims, including banks, the documents stated. One of the financial institutions, court filings stated, was based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The stolen information from the malware program would be sold in a “dark-web marketplace” and other cybercrime forums “to be exploited by others” or by Moses, according to court records.
In one instance on Nov. 30, 2022, the court documents stated, Moses took part in an online chat where he provided the usernames and passwords for victim accounts with several video streaming services he had obtained through the SmokeLoader malware.
In a separate online chat session a short time later, Moses stated he had sold the credentials and password of victims for $1 to $5 each, court records stated.
Moses had sent a screenshot to another person of his SmokeLoader interface from his server in the Netherlands showing a database of 619,763 files containing victims’ stolen data, according to the court documents.
“The amount of loss that was known to or reasonably foreseeable by the defendant was in excess of $40,000 but less than $95,000,” the plea agreement stated. 
During the hearing Wednesday, the judge explained to Moses the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty to a felony charge. Moses told Lanthier he wanted to plead guilty to the charge and waive his right to his trial.

June 19, 1865, marks the day the Emancipation Proclamation was finally enforced by Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger in Texas at the end of the Civil War. For slaves in Texas, their unshackling came more than two years after their freedom was ordered by President Lincoln. 
While only recently being recognized as a federal holiday in 2021, early Juneteenth celebrations date back as early as 1866. What started as a small community gathering in Galveston, Texas, quickly spread across the South where it was then brought all across the country during the Great Migration, beginning in 1910.

The Washington State Transportation Commission also recommended hiking the summer season surcharge to 35% on all routes and, on a trial basis, extending the life of multi-ride passes to 120 days starting next May. They now expire after 90 days.
Public comment on the approach will be accepted online through Aug. 5. A virtual public hearing will be held Aug. 6, with the commission then voting on a final fare hike proposal.
Those increases would be in addition to actions taken earlier this year by state lawmakers and Gov. Bob Ferguson.
They agreed to hike the capital surcharge tacked onto each ticket to $1 starting Oct. 1. It is now 50 cents. The money is used to fund construction of new state ferries. 
And they put a provision in the 2025-27 state transportation budget directing Washington State Ferries to levy a new 3% fee on credit card transactions beginning March 1, 2026. Fares paid by credit cards are an estimated 82% of farebox revenue, commission staff said.
State ferries’ staff said they worked to calibrate these changes with the various options they presented to the commission Tuesday.
“This is going to feel like a higher cost to the customer. We were very aware of that. When the customer feels like there is an increase to them, there is a drop in ridership,” Siri Olson, senior manager of financial planning for Washington State Ferries, told commissioners.
Under the transportation budget, Washington State Ferries is required to generate $408.8 million from fares in the next two years to help cover the agency’s day-to-day operating costs.
Fares differ by route as well as vehicle size, number of passengers and the time of year one travels. A surcharge is assessed on the base fare of a single vehicle between May 1 and  Sept. 30, which is the peak season for ridership. 
Under the current commission proposal, the standard passenger fare on the Mukilteo-Clinton route is expected to increase by 70 cents in October and an additional 15 cents in May 2026. For a standard-sized vehicle, the cost is expected to rise 85 cents in October 2025, and an additional 30 cents next May.
On the Seattle-Bremerton route, the passenger fare is expected to go up by 80 cents in October 2025 and an additional 30 cents next May. For standard vehicles, the increases are expected to be $1.05 in October and another 55 cents in May 2026.
Those estimates, provided by transportation commission staff, include this year’s boost to the vessel replacement surcharge.
Not included are the higher summer season surcharge or the credit card fee, both of which take effect next year. The surcharge will climb by 10% to the new level of 35% for all routes, except San Juan routes, which already have a 35% peak season levy.
“This has been an extremely complex fare-setting process,” said Aaron Halbert, financial analyst for the commission.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/samish-ferry-boat-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-18 18:04:54.043658

After many years of advocacy, state and local leaders celebrate the improvement of access to methadone treatment.

After years of groundwork, a treatment center for opioid use disorder is set to open on Depot Street in downtown Bennington this week. 
The opening will be a “real game changer for Bennington,” expanding access to methadone treatment and opioid use disorder recovery services in the region, said Kelly Dougherty, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Health.
The department has sought to open an opioid treatment program in Bennington for many years, but the Covid-19 pandemic and challenges finding a provider and location stalled progress, Dougherty said. The department is grateful to work with the Bay Area Addiction Research Treatment program as the operator of the Bennington-based center offering medication-assisted recovery treatments, counseling and other support services, she said. 
The Bay Area Addiction Treatment program runs similar centers in Berlin, St. Albans, St. Johnsbury and Newport.
The Vermont Department of Health provided a $3.9 million grant to help cover startup and operational costs of the program’s Bennington center. The grant will also help cover the cost of treatment for those without insurance through July 2026. The department does not want health insurance to be a barrier to access recovery resources, Dougherty said. 
The center plans to open for clients starting Thursday, assuming its first shipment of medication arrives Wednesday as planned, she said. 
Opioid treatment centers like this one must meet specific federal guidelines and safety measures, such as Drug Enforcement Agency regulations, so the department is glad the team has made it through “all those hurdles” and that the project is “going to be opening very soon,”  Dougherty said. 
Placing the center in downtown Bennington is intended to make  the path to recovery easier and  prevent further loss of lives to opioid use disorder in the region, Dougherty said. According to Department of Health data, rates of opioid-related death of Bennington County residents have fluctuated over the past decade, “but certainly there is a high need in the Bennington area,” she said. 
Vermont’s model for opioid use disorder treatment follows the design of a “hub and spokes,” Dougherty said. Hubs are where people can regularly access methadone to treat opioid use disorder. Spokes are primary care providers, where people can be prescribed buprenorphine and transition to longer-term treatment, she said. 
While Bennington has several spokes or primary care providers, Bennington Town Manager Stuart Hurd said residents have had to travel long distances to Brattleboro, Rutland or North Adams, Massachusetts, to receive methadone treatment. Now, locals can stay in their community while on the path to recovery, he said.  
Lorna Mattern, chief executive officer of Bennington’s United Counseling Service, said health service providers and advocates in the region have been asking for a hub location in Bennington for more than five years. Mattern said the United Counseling Service is glad the community has access to methadone treatment locally.
“With access to treatment in their own community, individuals in recovery can lead fuller, more stable lives — free from the burden of daily out-of-town travel,” Mattern wrote in an email statement to VTDigger. “This means they can stay close to home, maintain employment, and spend more meaningful time with their families, all while receiving the support they need on their recovery journey.”
Bennington Select Board Chair Tom Haley said the new treatment center was a long time coming and can help break down roadblocks to residents receiving necessary medicine. 
“We — like every other town in the country — are struggling with ways to help people with substance use disorder, and this is just one more way that we’re going to be able to do that,” Haley said.

(Courtesy of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission)The Supreme Court’s ruling Wednesday in favor of a company seeking to store nuclear waste in Texas has implications for neighboring New Mexico’s fight to prevent a similar facility being built here.
But the ruling does not mean New Mexicans should expect truckloads of radioactive material to arrive anytime soon, advocates and experts say.
The court ruled 6-3 that Texas and other parties did not have standing to challenge the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s decision to provide a permit to Interim Storage Partners. 
Camilla Feibelman, spokesperson for Rio Grande Sierra Club, said the ruling puts organizations like hers “in a fix” because it effectively removes the ability of any outside group or government body to intervene with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s permitting process. 
Florida-based company Holtec International is seeking to build a similar nuclear waste storage facility for 40 years in New Mexico in a rural site between Hobbs and Carlsbad, about 40 miles east of Interim Storage Partners’ proposed site in Texas.
In May 2023, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission awarded Holtec a license in New Mexico to “receive, possess, transfer and store 500 canisters holding approximately 8,680 metric tons of commercial spent nuclear fuel for 40 years.”
NM leaders decry federal license for nuclear storage facility

The Sierra Club sued the regulatory commission in federal court in a lawsuit still pending today. 
But Wednesday’s ruling in the Texas case sets a precedent that the organization cannot challenge the license in court, Feibelman said. 
“There’s basically never an opportunity to argue the merits of the licensure, and there’s no avenue for us to do that,” she said of the ruling. 
In a statement provided to Axios, a Holtec spokesperson said the ruling is a “significant win for the nuclear industry.” A spokesperson for Holtec did not respond to a request for comment from Source NM. 
Despite the ruling, Feibelman and Don Hancock, a decades-long anti-nuclear advocate in New Mexico with the Southwest Research and Information Center, said state and other protections remain that will provide a meaningful barrier to Holtec getting to build the facility in New Mexico. 
In the 2023 legislative session, New Mexico passed Senate Bill 53. The law bans state agencies from granting permits, contracts or leases for building a high-level nuclear waste storage facility. This would include New Mexico Department of Transportation and New Mexico Environment permits needed for construction and operations.
Trump’s push for Southwest uranium will face stiff state review

Hancock said that state is not affected by the Supreme Court ruling, and so it remains an effective way to stop Holtec. That was underscored in how Holtec responded to the ruling, he said.
“The press statement from Holtec did not say, ‘We’re going to proceed with our site in New Mexico,’” he said. “They didn’t say that because, I think they know they cannot proceed with the site in New Mexico.”
Hancock also described what he saw as unfavorable market conditions for Holtec, which he said cannot find customers to provide nuclear waste for it to store. 
Between the bad economics and the state’s opposition, Hancock said, “people in New Mexico are in the same place as we’ve been for several years,” even with the ruling. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told Axios Wednesday that the state would continue to fight against more nuclear waste storage in New Mexico. 
“Holtec is not welcome in New Mexico, but we’ve been preparing for this, and I’ll do everything I can to prevent them from storing even more radioactive waste here,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement.
The Supreme Court ruling comes as President Donald Trump seeks to quickly increase domestic energy supply, including nuclear energy, by fast-tracking uranium mine sites. Several long-standing mines in New Mexico are now priority projects at the United States Forest Service or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, though state regulators have told Source New Mexico their permitting structure is robust and a necessary step before any new mines can break ground.

Chuck Grassley, in a Wednesday call with reporters, said he hopes negotiation will be possible in the mounting conflict between Israel and Iran.
“I prefer negotiation over military action,” Grassley said. “I would prefer military action only if there’s an immediate threat to the United States.” 
Grassley, asked about his opinions toward potential U.S. involvement in the conflict, said he is “not in the situation room” as the president is, but said Iran is “an enemy of the United States” when it says “death to Israel and death to America.” 
President Donald Trump has hinted at American involvement in the conflict but has not said publicly how he plans to intervene.
Grassley also spoke about updates from the Senate to the “one big, beautiful bill” which would set federal spending and debt limits. He said it would prevent the “largest tax increase in American history.”

Senate Republicans announced Monday their plan to raise the U.S. debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than what the House approved in its version of the bill. 
Grassley, who is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said contrary to what he hears from Democrats, the bill does not cut taxes for billionaires. Grassley said the tax rates in the bill are the same rates that were set in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
In a letter from the Congressional Budget Office to the U.S. House Budget Committee ranking member and House minority leader about analysis of the bill, the CBO said “in general, resources would decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas resources would increase for households in the middle and top of the income distribution.” 
Grassley also defended the massive bill’s provisions around the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid. Grassley said the U.S. Senate is not asking states to “pick up a big share of the cost” of the SNAP program, but is leaving it up to the states to cover administrative costs. 
According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, the bill increases the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75% and would require states with more than 6% error rates to initiate higher cost-sharing rates. It would also significantly reduce federal spending on Medicaid, which offers health care to low-income families. 
The bill has faced criticism for its work requirements for both Medicaid and SNAP recipients, which critics say would add red tape to the programs that would hurt vulnerable populations. 
Grassley said the work requirements “seem to me as good policy.” Grassley said there are numerous exemptions for folks who are unable to work or who have children. The bill also allows for volunteer work, or time spent in school to meet the requirements. 
“Medicaid benefits will not be cut for our most vulnerable, that’s very clear,” Grassley said citing various exemptions. 
Senate leadership has indicated the budget reconciliation bill will be finalized in the Senate before the Fourth of July break.

Carol McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat and sponsor of a comprehensive bottle bill, was disappointed by the revisions reducing the legislation to a state-commissioned study. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Upon first mention of the phrase “bottle bill” at the State House Tuesday night, Rep. Carol McEntee’s face dropped.
“I am not happy,” the South Kingstown Democrat said.
That’s because 24 hours earlier, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson unveiled amended legislation gutting McEntee’s 57-page bill. Gone is the proposed 10-cent fee on recyclable bottles redeemed upon return to designated redemption sites. 
In its place, another study, this time, by a third-party consultant hired by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM). The compromise aims to find middle ground for environmental advocates and beverage makers and retailers, who failed to reach consensus on a deposit-refund program.
Meanwhile, a separate environmental priority to overhaul the troubled Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) also appears dead in the water amid hesitation at the corresponding price tag, with a less extreme alternative in its place.
“It does appear as though this has not really been a great year for the environment,” Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, said in an interview. “A lot of the big, high-profile bills are either not moving or being substantially reduced.”
The amended bottle bill and CRMC membership bill both advanced out of House committees Wednesday afternoon. The Senate Committee on Environment and Agriculture is slated to take up the companions for each Wednesday night. 
But the end-of-session whirlwind leaves open the possibility for lawmakers to resurrect more environmentally friendly bills during final floor sessions slated for Friday.
Bottled frustration over ‘compromise’
Despite initial disappointment, McEntee was warming to the weakened version, which preserves a small section of her original bill.
“This is what DEM would have to do anyway in the first six to nine months if we passed the bill,” McEntee said during the committee discussion. 
McEntee’s original proposal laid out the specifics of a deposit-refund program, simultaneously requiring statewide assessments on recycling and redemption.
But a standalone needs assessment lacks the details needed for a successful review, Thorp said. 
“I know the speaker had questions about how the bill would work, and some of those are valid concerns,” Thorp said. “But unless you’re looking at an actual proposal for a specific type of bottle bill program, you can’t really answer those questions.”
Shekarchi said a statewide assessment was needed because of “conflicting data” regarding best practices for improving state recycling rates. But considering best practices and models from the 10 other states with similar programs was the intent behind the 18-month legislative study commission that McEntee co-chaired, which issued its final recommendations in April.
“I think the data is absolutely clear,” Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat and commission co-chair, said in an interview Monday. “There’s nothing that compares to a bottle bill in terms of effectiveness.” 
McKenney, who sponsored the Senate counterpart to McEntee’s bottle bill, faulted retailers and manufacturers, who despite promising to work toward compromise, continue to decry the various iterations of a bottle bill presented to them.
“The reality is, they are interested in profits,” McKenney said. “I don’t think they are concerned about what’s going into our bay, what’s going into our seafood, what we’re ingesting when we take a swim.”
Chris Hunter, a spokesperson for the Stop the Rhode Island Bottle Tax Coalition, suggested the industry was still open to future legislation.
“Rhode Islanders deserve an innovative recycling system, like those adopted recently by other states, that raises recycling rates without raising the costs on hundreds of everyday beverages,” Hunter said.
McEntee confirmed Tuesday she’s pushing to make a few more tweaks to the already amended bottle bill, including moving up the Dec. 28, 2026, deadline to complete the statewide needs assessment.

CRMC reform? Add a coastal biologist  
A three-year push to reform the troubled state coastal agency by getting rid of the appointed council and empowering administrators to make decisions remains stuck in legislative purgatory.
Instead, legislative leaders are backing an alternative that reduces the council’s membership from 10 to seven people and adds professional qualification requirements. 
Existing state law sets membership requirements for the coastal panel based on where they live. Legislation sponsored by Rep. Alex Finkelman, a Jamestown Democrat, and Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat, reduces the size of the council from 10 to seven seats — in acknowledgment of the council’s vacancies, which have created quorum problems and canceled meetings. Four of seven members would have to attend a meeting to reach a quorum under the legislation, compared with the six-person minimum now.
The new group of seven members would all have some “background, qualifications and expertise in environmental matters.” There are also reserved seats for an engineer, a coastal biologist and an environmental organization representative. The new members would serve three-year terms, like their predecessors. 
“It’s a step in the right direction,” Finkelman said in an interview. “To me, this lays the groundwork for the future.”
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who pushed for the more sweeping reform bill, indicated his support for the reshaping of council membership and qualifications, too.
“We welcome this reform as a first step and look forward to continuing to advocate for the best possible management of our coastal resources,” Neronha said in a statement Wednesday. 
But Save the Bay urged state lawmakers to vote against the watered down council membership legislation in a statement on Tuesday.
Thorp noted that unlike the more sweeping reform proposals, which received widespread support, only one group — the Rhode Island Builders Association — spoke in favor of Finkelman’s bill during a prior committee vetting.
“I don’t understand why they chose to move the least popular bill,” Thorp said.
Thorp anticipated problems in populating the reshaped council, especially with strict criteria around professional expertise. 
“Good luck finding a representative from an environmental nonprofit that’s going to want to spend its limited resources going to two council meetings at night a month,” Thorp said. 
Save the Bay is not interested, he said.
Finkelman said he hoped “public outcry” over unpopular decisions by the existing council might spur interest from prospective council members.
The bill does not preclude existing or prior members from being reappointed if they meet the new criteria. And it allows the existing council members to continue to serve until replacements are named.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision:
“We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

SPRINGFIELD — A group of Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit this week that seeks to nullify legislation they say would indelibly alter both the business and legal landscape of Illinois.

Senate Bill 328 would amend a key provision of Illinois civil law by allowing, in certain kinds of cases, any company authorized to do business in the state to be sued in Illinois courts, even if the underlying claims and the parties have no connection to the state.

As written, the bill would apply only in cases filed under the Uniform Hazardous Substances Act in which the plaintiff claims an injury or illness resulting from exposure to a toxic substance.

What is unique about the GOP lawsuit, however, is that it doesn’t just seek to nullify the legislation before Gov. JB Pritzker signs it. It also asks the court to bar the legislature from using a procedure that has become common in the General Assembly known as “gut-and-replace.” This effectively allows lawmakers to sidestep the Illinois Constitution’s requirement that every bill be read, by title, three times on three different days in each chamber before it is passed because amendments are not required to be read on three different days in each chamber.

That procedure is used frequently for major legislation passed in the final days of a legislative session, including budget bills.

“Illinois’ reputation as one of the most corrupt states in the nation and one of the worst states in the nation for business go hand in hand,” Senate Republican Leader John Curran, R-Downers Grove, said during a virtual news conference Wednesday. “Allowing legislators to disregard the Constitution and good government transparency processes to make laws that are bad for our state is the root cause of both narratives.”

The proposal stems from a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court case, Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., in which the court upheld a Pennsylvania law that requires out-of-state corporations to agree to allow Pennsylvania courts to exercise “general personal jurisdiction” over them, just as those courts exercise over domestic corporations.

“This is legalized litigation tourism,” said Sen. Jason Plummer, R-Edwardsville. “And it further damages Illinois’ reputation as a state that's hostile to businesses and job creators.”

SB 328 began as what’s known in the General Assembly as a “shell bill” — one that has a title and a bill number but no substantive content. In this case, the original language called for making a technical change in one sentence in the Code of Civil Procedure, deleting the word “and” and replacing it with the word “and.”

Each session, lawmakers in both chambers introduce hundreds of such bills, most of which are never acted upon. But they are often amended into substantive legislation later in the session, especially after deadlines for introducing new bills or passing bills out of committees have passed.

That is what happened with SB 328, which began as a shell bill but was amended in the Senate to make a technical change to the way court clerks handle electronically filed documents. It passed out of the Senate on April 10 by a vote of 56-0 and was sent to the House.

In the House, it was read for the first time on April 11 and was assigned to a committee, which voted April 30 to recommend it be passed. It was read a second time on May 13.

On May 30, the next-to-last day of the session, Rep. Jay Hoffman, D-Swansea, introduced a “gut-and-replace” amendment that removed the language about electronic court filings and replaced it with the new language allowing out-of-state corporations to be sued in Illinois courts over acts that may have occurred elsewhere.

That amendment was never sent to a substantive committee but instead was debated on the floor of the House where it passed the night of May 31 by a partisan vote of 77-40. That vote also counted as the third reading of the bill in the House, meaning the bill number had now been read on three different days in each chamber. It was then sent back to the Senate, which voted 37-19 shortly after midnight on June 1 to concur in the House amendment.

“We have long discussed with our partners, members and constituents filing suit on this issue, even prior to me being in leadership this year,” House Republican Leader Tony McCombie, of Savanna, said during the news conference. “The caucus members brought forward this egregious example of SB 328, and said let's move forward.”

The lawsuit was filed in circuit court in Sangamon County. It lists 47 Republican lawmakers as plaintiffs. House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch and Senate President Don Harmon are named as defendants.

Harmon, D-Oak Park, who sponsored the amended bill in the Senate, did not immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment.

Separately, the Illinois Freedom Caucus has also filed a lawsuit in Sangamon County alleging the state’s budget bill did not satisfy the three readings requirement for similar reasons. A hearing in the case is scheduled for July 3.

Tate Reeves announced Wednesday.
The memorandum of understanding, a nonbinding agreement, between Mississippi and the California-based company will introduce AI programs across the state’s community colleges, universities and technical institutions. The initiative will aim to train at least 10,000 Mississippians using a curriculum designed around AI skills, machine learning and data science. 
Mississippi now joins Utah, California and Oregon, which have signed on to similar programs with Nvidia. 
“This collaboration with Nvidia is monumental for Mississippi. By expanding AI education, investing in workforce development and encouraging innovation, we, along with Nvidia, are creating a pathway to dynamic careers in AI and cybersecurity for Mississippians,” Reeves said. “These are the in-demand jobs of the future — jobs that will change the landscape of our economy for generations to come. AI is here now, and it is here to stay.”
The agreement does not award any tax incentives to Nvidia, but Reeves said the state would provide funding for the initiative. Still, he did not foresee having to call a special legislative session in order to pay for it. Reeves said officials and Nvidia were still determining the exact dollar figure the project would require, but the state would spend as much as it took to reach its goal of training at least 10,000 Mississippians. 
Some of the funding may come from $9.1 million in grants to state institutions of higher learning through the Mississippi AI Talent Accelerator Program, which Reeves announced last week. 
Nvidia designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), and the Mississippi program will focus on teaching people to work with GPUs. The company has seen growing demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power AI applications.
Now the world’s most valuable chipmaker, Nvidia announced in April that it will produce its AI supercomputers in the United States for the first time.
Louis Stewart, head of strategic initiatives for Nvidia’s global developer ecosystem, said the Mississippi program is part of a larger effort to bolster the United States’ position as the global leader in artificial intelligence.
“Together, we will enhance economic growth through an AI-skilled workforce, advanced research, and industry engagement, positioning Mississippi as a hub for AI-driven transformation to the benefit of its communities.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/29192623/State-of-the-State-1.jpg,,,2025-06-18 18:04:54.043658

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado could face a budget crunch totaling in the billions of dollars if a sweeping tax and spending bill proposed by President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress becomes law, analysts warned state lawmakers on Wednesday.
The so-called budget reconciliation bill has passed the House and is now being considered in the Senate, which has offered its own version with slightly different policy points. State economists from the governor’s Office of State Planning and Budget relied on the House-passed version for their analysis.
Colorado be on the hook for up to $650 million per year to offset the bill’s deep cuts to federally-funded social programs. State costs for Medicaid could increase by up to $350 million, and costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could increase by up to $300 million if the federal bill passes and state policy does not change, OSPB Director Mark Ferrandino told lawmakers on Wednesday.

That is due to the provisions considered in the federal bill that reduce federal funding and create more administrative burden for the state agencies in charge of running Medicaid and SNAP, including new mandatory work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, cuts to federal matching for states that have coverage for immigrants without legal status and increased dollar matching for SNAP.
In addition to those new costs, the tax changes considered in the reconciliation bill could add up to a roughly $600 million hit to Colorado’s state tax revenue. An economic recession, the odds of which the governor’s office now estimates at 50%, could cause another $1.6 billion budget hole.
“We do have a potential of a recession and potential of reconciliation… that could really wreak havoc in where we are from a budget perspective,” Ferrandino told members of the Joint Budget Committee, who use quarterly economic forecasts like the one presented Wednesday to craft the state budget.
Both the OSPB and the nonpartisan Legislative Council Staff downgraded their economic growth predictions and General Fund revenue from March.
“Trump’s disastrous tariff taxes continue to wreak havoc on our economy and the erratic trade policy is projected to continue hurting our economy, slowing job growth, and increasing chances of a recession,” Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a statement. “These national circumstances present a difficult economic environment for the state.”
The JBC is fresh off a legislative session where they had to balance a state budget with a $1.2 billion starting deficit. They wrote a $43.9 billion spending plan that cut state funding for transportation projects and social programs created through legislation that were barely implemented.
There will be another economic forecast before budget writers start work on the 2026–27 fiscal year plan.
“In a tight budget year, we protected the key services and programs Coloradans and their families rely on, but Colorado can simply not absorb the proposed federal cuts to Medicaid and SNAP,” Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, said in a statement after the forecast.
Both sets of economists predict that state tax revenue will exceed the limit set by the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights over the next few years, but that surplus will be small. Colorado is required to refund excess revenue back to taxpayers through a variety of mechanisms, and the anticipated surpluses may not cover required property tax reimbursements to local governments. The Legislature may need to spend $72 million in the upcoming fiscal year and $154 million in the following fiscal year to make up the difference, according to the LCS. The small TABOR surplus also means there probably will not be an income tax reduction or Family Affordability Tax Credit for the 2026 tax year. OSPB does predict those tax credits will be triggered for the 2025 tax year.
Due to lower income tax revenue and several pieces of recent state legislation, Colorado is anticipated to have $313 million less in its general fund during the 2025–26 fiscal year than what was previously projected, according to LCS.
Much of the projected excess costs to the general fund come from a ballot measure funding law enforcement recruitment and training that voters passed last year. The General Fund will also have about $230 million less in the 2026–27 fiscal year to implement a new school funding plan by moving that money to the State Education Fund.

The Vermont-based outdoor gear and apparel company Orvis plans to lay off 4% of its workforce by the end of the year, the company said Wednesday. 
The decision requires the Manchester-based brand to let go of at least 50 employees. In a statement to VTDigger, Orvis President Simon Perkins said the layoffs were part of a broader reorganization the company would be undertaking in the coming months.
“Tariffs disrupted our business model in ways we haven’t faced before and have exposed a clear path to solidifying our long-term future,” Perkins said. “Moving forward, Orvis will be returning to our roots and shifting our entire focus to the core strengths of our business—the fly fishing and wingshooting pursuits that have guided our company for nearly 170 years and inspire our customers in unique and powerful ways.”

It was not immediately clear which categories of employees are being affected by the layoffs or how many people had already been let go as of Wednesday afternoon. Brian Holcomb, a spokesperson for Orvis, said the reorganization effort had just been announced internally Wednesday and “meetings are ongoing.”
The latest reductions follow more than 110 job cuts the company made in 2024 while closing some retail locations and discontinuing its catalogue sales service. Last year, Orvis also moved its headquarters from Sunderland to Manchester, saying at the time it was moving to a smaller building to shrink its footprint after it had taken on more remote workers. 
Founded in 1856 in Manchester, Orvis claims to be the oldest mail-order retailer in the United States and sells fishing equipment, hunting gear and outdoor apparel, much of which is manufactured in Asian countries.  
In the statement, Perkins said he would be “detailing our vision of the future soon” but did not specify whether the current reorganization effort would require any further store closures or which products, if any, the company plans to discontinue as it limits its scope.
“These decisions deeply impact the lives of our associates and our communities, and we do not take them lightly,” Perkins said. “We are leaning on our values and handling this process with both care and regard for our team.”

Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo told Assembly lawmakers in April the fund was healthy but still recovering. (Photo courtesy of N.J. governor's office)Unemployment insurance taxes paid by New Jersey businesses will decline in July, years after a surge on pandemic jobless claims drained the state fund that pays unemployment benefits and triggered a tax hike.
Rates under the unemployment insurance tax will fall to between 0.5% and 5.8% when the new fiscal year begins in July, down from between 0.6% and 6.4%, the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development announced Wednesday.
“The unemployment insurance tax reduction demonstrates a major milestone in New Jersey’s economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic,” Gov. Phil Murphy said in a statement. “We are now able to ease employers’ burdens while continuing to strengthen our workforce. This progress reflects our ongoing commitment to create a robust economy that supports our employees.”
In New Jersey, unemployment insurance tax rates are set by the health of the state’s unemployment insurance fund and individual businesses’ use of unemployment benefits.
The Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund’s balance sets the range for rates. Rates are higher when fund balances are low, as they were following record unemployment claims during the pandemic, and rates fall as heightened contributions refill state coffers and joblessness recedes.
Individual businesses’ use of unemployment benefits and their payments into the fund determine their tax rate within the range. Businesses that see many jobless claims will typically have higher rates than those that see few.
The department said the lower rates, which will kick in July 1, are expected to save New Jersey businesses about $300 million annually.
Tom Bracken, president and CEO of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, called it welcome news for the state’s businesses.
“The estimated $300 million in savings will give many businesses a critical opportunity to reinvest in their operations, support their workforce, and strengthen their communities. At a time of continued economic uncertainty, this relief couldn’t come at a better moment for employers who are already facing significant financial pressures,” he said.
Chris Emigholz, chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, welcomed lower rates but cautioned lawmakers against increasing other business taxes in the coming fiscal year.
“This is great news for New Jersey job creators, and it’s important that this savings that employers desperately need right now is not offset by further business tax increases,” he said.
Murphy’s proposed budget for fiscal 2026 includes higher taxes on casinos’ gambling winnings, a $2-per-truck fee on warehouses, and higher tax rates on certain property transactions above $1 million.
The decline in unemployment tax rates was unexpected. In April, Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo told Assembly lawmakers the fund was healthy but still recovering. In responses to lawmakers, his agency said it expected unemployment insurance rates to remain static through fiscal 2027, which runs from July 1, 2026, to June 30, 2027.
At the time, the unemployment fund had a balance of $1.6 billion, and that balance was expected to rise to roughly $2 billion after tax payments from the first quarter of 2025 were collected, Asaro-Angelo said in April. Rates could be lowered because collections exceeded expectations, the agency said. The current fund balance was not immediately clear.

The proposal in Maine, which would have created a state-level recognition process there, was one of several bills related to tribal identity that lawmakers across northern New England considered in recent months.

State legislators in Maine rejected a bill last month that would have created a state-level process, similar to one on the books in Vermont, for recognizing local groups as Native American tribes. Opponents of the bill pointed to the sharp criticism Vermont’s process has faced in recent years as one of the reasons to vote the legislation down.
“Take a look at what’s happened in Vermont,” said Rep. Adam Lee, a Democrat from  Auburn, Maine, on the House floor in early May. The “contentious issue” in Vermont, he continued, has “harmed” Vermont’s relationship with tribes that are recognized at the federal level, suggesting that by passing the bill, Maine would be doing the same.
Debate over the proposal came as legislators in Vermont and New Hampshire were also considering — and also did not advance — other bills related to tribal identity. 
Vermont’s recognition process has been criticized by two Abenaki nations centered in Quebec, as well as researchers at the University of Vermont and in Canada. They maintain that many members of the four groups Vermont recognized as Abenaki in 2011 and 2012 are not Indigenous and, instead, have been appropriating Abenaki culture. 
The Vermont groups assert that they can, in fact, claim Abenaki identities and have repeatedly urged the First Nations to stay out of their affairs.
Odanak and W8linak First Nations have federal-level recognition from the Canadian government. That’s a different standard — and, the First Nations’ leaders say, a far more rigorous one — than the Vermont groups had to meet. With federal recognition, Odanak and W8linak can access greater government resources than the Vermont groups can in the U.S., and they can claim pieces of land as sovereign territory. (According to the First Nations’ tribal government, the symbol “8” used in “W8linak” represents a specific “o” sound, which is pronounced as it is in the word “on.”)
The state recognition proposal in Maine also faced opposition from the leaders of four Wabanaki nations located within the modern-day borders of that state — and which have federal-level recognition from the U.S. government. Those are the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Mi’kmaq Nation, Penobscot Nation and the Passamaquoddy Tribe.
Federal, state recognition
The Wabanaki Nations have longstanding ties to Abenaki people, including through a shared language. At the heart of disagreements over Vermont’s recognition process are contested narratives of who can claim legitimate descendency from historic Abenaki communities that were largely stripped of their homeland by European colonizers.
In a statement posted to Facebook in March, the Wabanaki Alliance — a nonprofit organization that advocates for the Wabanaki Nations’ sovereignty — pointed to Vermont’s process in urging Maine lawmakers to reject the bill proposed in that state.
“The creation of state recognition processes in other states has caused problems and frustrations, as in the notable example of Abenaki tribes in Vermont who could not meet the criteria for federal recognition, but who were still recognized by the State of Vermont,” the alliance wrote in the post. 
The statement also highlighted “years of objections and testimony from the recognized existing Abenaki Nations in Quebec” about the Vermont-based groups’ “legitimacy.”
Vermont lawmakers set up a state recognition process under a law, Act 107, passed in 2010. While not a carbon copy of the Vermont legislation, the bill considered in Maine this year would have, like in Vermont, given power to review applications for recognition to a commission appointed by the state’s governor. The commission, like in Vermont, could then advance a recommendation to the Legislature for further consideration. 
It did include identical language, in some areas, to Vermont’s existing law, including a requirement that “a substantial number” of the members of a group seeking state recognition are related to one another “by kinship and trace their ancestry to a kinship group through genealogy or other methods.” 
That’s a different — and less stringent — standard than the U.S. federal government’s recognition requirements, which demand, among other stipulations, that an applicant must have been identified as Native American “on a substantially continuous basis since 1900.” One of the groups in Vermont — the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi — applied for federal recognition in the 1980s, but its application was rejected.

The Maine proposal was closely linked to a yearslong push by another group called the Kineo St. John Tribe to get formal recognition from the state’s government. The Kineo St. John Tribe does not have federal-level tribal recognition, either.
(While the Wabanaki Nations have federal recognition, they receive fewer benefits and protections than other federally recognized tribes in the U.S. due to their unique status under existing state and federal law, according to the Wabanaki Alliance’s website.)
In May, Maine legislators also rejected a bill that would have granted the Kineo St. John Tribe state-level recognition without establishing a process that other groups could use in the future. Supporters of the bill, including Maine Rep. Jennifer Poirier, a Republican from Skowhegan, said acknowledgment of the group’s legitimacy was long overdue.
Leaders from the Wabanaki Nations were opposed to that legislation too. The Wabanaki Alliance’s executive director, Maulian Bryant, emphasized that the nations took issue more with establishing a state-level process than with the identity of the group seeking recognition. 
“The concerns within the Wabanaki Alliance are, you know, appropriating tribal identity and validity,” Bryant said during a Maine legislative committee hearing in March. “Maybe not the group in question right now. But, it could lead to groups down the road, basically, meeting a much lower threshold set by state government — and not having a whole lot of validity as tribal people.”
Efforts in Vermont, New Hampshire
Maine legislators’ consideration of the bills came as their counterparts in Vermont heard two sharply contrasting presentations at the Statehouse in Montpelier this year. One, hosted by Vermont Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, featured Odanak leaders and urged lawmakers to reconsider, if not undo, Vermont’s state recognition process. 
Headrick also introduced a Vermont House bill that would establish a task force to “review the validity” of the state’s past tribal recognitions — and determine whether any should be rescinded. The legislation, H.362, had a brief hearing in the House General & Housing Committee in early April but did not advance past the panel this year.
Odanak and W8linak leaders have backed Headrick’s effort, calling it “a significant step toward recognizing the true history and rights of the Abenaki people” in a press release.

Later in April, the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs, which is the panel tasked with reviewing state recognition applications, held a presentation of its own at the Statehouse featuring leaders from Vermont’s state-recognized tribes. Those groups are the Missisquoi, the Elnu Abenaki, Nulhegan Abenaki, and Koasek Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation. 
The Vermont leaders — along with several researchers — urged legislators to reject Odanak and W8linak’s push to revisit the recognition process and, instead, spend time advocating for the members of the state-recognized tribes’ own needs and interests. 
Following that presentation, several Vermont House members, led by Georgia Republican Rep. Carolyn Branagan, introduced a resolution stating that the Legislature “reaffirms its support” for the state’s existing recognition process as well as for the “legitimacy” of the four groups that have already been recognized. 
The measure, J.R.H.4, had a hearing in the general and housing committee in May but didn’t make it past that point, either, before Vermont lawmakers adjourned for the year.
One of the speakers at the April panel was Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan group.  Just a month prior, Stevens was in New Hampshire speaking to legislators about a bill under consideration in that state’s House — and that Stevens was keen to see pass.
The proposal, which also did not make it over the finish line this year, would have allowed only enrolled members of state- or federally-recognized tribes with “historic and contemporary” ties to New Hampshire to serve on the state’s existing Commission on Native American Affairs. That would include Stevens’ group, per the bill, as well as the three other Vermont-recognized tribes. 
The legislation would also have given the leaders of recognized tribes power to nominate people to serve on the commission, with the speaker of the New Hampshire House confirming appointments. Currently, the state’s governor appoints applicants to the majority of the seats on the panel, who hail “from the Native American communities throughout the state,” according to the commission’s procedures.
There are no groups, however, with state- or federal-level recognition based in New Hampshire today. The bill would have also called for a report back on whether New Hampshire should develop its own state tribal recognition process, like Vermont’s.
Stevens said he supported the new proposed nomination process because it would allow the Nulhegan group to better advocate for its hundreds of members who live in New Hampshire, even though the group is based in Vermont. He said the border is, in some ways, arbitrary for those people because ancestral Abenaki territory spans both states.
“I’m just saying, you know, recognize the fact that that’s our homeland,” Stevens said in an interview. “We need to be on the commission to represent our own people.”

Currently, some members of New Hampshire’s commission are part of groups that say they are Abenaki but aren’t recognized by a state or federal government, according to New Hampshire Public Radio. Several members of the commission spoke at the March hearing, too, and said they opposed the proposal because it would, in their view, cede authority over a New Hampshire panel to people who live in a different state.
Asked about that argument in an interview, Stevens said his goal was not to “go against” anyone in a neighboring state, because his and the other Vermont groups already have the legitimacy they need from Vermont’s state government. 
“We’re already protected,” he said of Vermont’s groups. “We’re already recognized.”
Headrick, the Burlington representative, sent an email in March to the sponsors of the New Hampshire bill suggesting they reconsider it, pointing to Odanak and W8linak’s assertions that the Vermont-based groups have not sufficiently demonstrated Abenaki ancestry.
“I strongly urge careful consideration to avoid repeating the mistakes made here in Vermont,” Headrick wrote in the message, which he shared with VTDigger.
The New Hampshire bill also drew opposition from the Quebec-based First Nations themselves. In a press release issued after state legislators decided not to advance the measure, the First Nations’ leaders framed that fact as a win.
‘’This decision demonstrates a growing awareness of Indigenous and identity-related issues as well as an understanding of the repercussions that actions such as those proposed in this bill can have on our rights, identity, and heritage,” Rick O’Bomsawin, the Odanak chief, said in the statement. “We hope that this stance will help protect our Nation and discourage acts of usurpation that affect our people.”

Trash has long spelled trouble for wildlife. Now, Teton County is taking a “sterner” approach with people, issuing 330 violations for homeowners and businesses failing to lock it up.
The post In Jackson Hole, people aren’t fortifying their garbage, luring bears and leading to conflicts appeared first on WyoFile .","In the middle of the night last fall, Calico restaurant-area resident Hannah Navarro heard a bear just outside her window.
The bruin had sniffed out Navarro’s trash and was wrestling with her chain-and-carabiner-latched garbage can. She jumped into action, knocking on the glass, thinking she could scare the bear off. But the bruin wasn’t deterred. Instead, it just sat there, eating her garbage.
“So I went and got my bear spray, and I opened up the window, and I just sprayed him in the face close-range,” Navarro said. “And he ran off.”
Navarro now knows that her trash can was not bear-resistant, and thus noncompliant with Teton County rules. Last fall, she received a notice of violation from Teton County telling her as much and imploring her to get a new trash can. The notice was one of hundreds that Olivia Graykowski, a county code compliance officer, has posted on trash cans around Jackson Hole. It’s mundane, not-often-appreciated work. But Graykowski’s work puts her on the front lines of protecting Jackson Hole’s beloved bears.
Without enforcement, problems with bears will just get worse, she said. In places like Lake Tahoe, California, some neighborhoods require metal bear boxes in front of almost every house and homeowners string electric wires across windows to keep bruins from breaking and entering. In Aspen, Colorado, some 30 bears have taken up residence around the Pitkin County landfill, and pillage nearby neighborhoods.
“I don’t know if people really understand where it could get to, because it hasn’t gotten there yet,” Graykowski said. “The work we’re doing is trying to prevent that.”
In 2024, a commuter struck and killed Grizzly 399, a world-famous bear whose 2021 journey through southern Jackson Hole inspired Teton County and the Town of Jackson to beef up their bear-proofing efforts.


After the grizzly matriarch died in the Snake River Canyon in October, the News&Guide used the Wyoming Public Records Act to request every notice of bear-resistant container violations Teton County sent in 2024, which totaled 330 violations issued to 284 different property owners. Violations were clustered near Wilson, Rafter J and Highway 390. The violators list included acclaimed mountaineer Jimmy Chin, the News&Guide’s own multimedia sales manager Chad Repinski and businesses like the Blue Collar Restaurant Group’s Sidewinders American Grill on the West Bank, as well as the Bodega gas station at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort.
Blue Collar CEO Nicole Davis said that, because most of the group’s restaurants are in Jackson, she didn’t know about the county requirements until receiving the notice. Sidewinders bought a compliant dumpster shortly afterward. Repinski also came into compliance. Chin and Jackson Hole Mountain Resort did not respond to requests for comment.
In 2024, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department recorded 148 black bear conflicts in Teton County — situations where bears endanger people’s safety, their property or bear conservation — which was about twice the annual average. Most of the issues were in the neighborhoods where county officials issued violations: neighborhoods along Highway 390, the town of Wilson and the neighborhoods along Fall Creek Road south of Wilson.
Of the conflicts, 127, or 85%, involved unsecured garbage, Game and Fish large carnivore biologist Mike Boyce said. State officials relocated 10 blacks bears and killed six.
On his morning patrols, Boyce regularly sees trash cans that bears have “nuked,” leaving “garbage strewn about.” But he still thinks the Jackson Hole community is making progress in locking up its trash more securely.
“Lack of enforcement has been the missing link,” Boyce said. “And we just continue to have conflicts in the same places.”
Stern warnings
On a warm spring Thursday in May — trash day — Graykowski shifted Teton County’s Chevrolet Equinox into gear and drove straight from town to the West Bank of the Snake River. She meandered through the trash can-lined streets of neighborhoods near Wilson and off Wyoming Highway 390 with her eyes peeled. She scanned trash cans, evaluating whether they fit county regulations requiring homeowners to dispose of their garbage in self-locking, bear-resistant cans.
When she spotted older carabiner-latched cans similar to the one Navarro had replaced, or trash bags strewn about, Graykowski stopped and got out of the car to take photos on a county iPad. Graykowski attaches those photos to formal notices of violation for disobeying county land-use regulations and feeding wildlife. But even sending the notice of violations marks a change of approach for the Teton County Planning and Building Department, which enforces county regulations.
Rather than educating offenders, officials are now pursuing enforcement, Planning Director Chris Neubecker said.
Regulations requiring bear-resistant trash cans around Wilson have been in place since about 2009. But after the new county code passed in 2022, the department started attaching orange tags to cans, attempting to educate homeowners about the new requirements. Code compliance officers would then write outreach letters. In 2024, the county started taking a “sterner” approach and issuing the notices of violation.

But Teton County officials can’t issue fines directly. Doing so requires going through a lengthy process known as “abatement,” which requires hearings before county commissioners and, ultimately, court enforcement.
That judicial-like process hasn’t happened yet during Neubecker’s tenure — but it could soon.
If a property owner receives numerous notices of violation and fails to lock up their trash, the county will issue them a notice to abate, Neubecker said. The county has a few property owners on its radar who have been notified about non-compliant bear cans numerous times. Depending on whether those property owners comply, the county could have an abatement hearing soon, Neubecker said. The proceedings would closely resemble a property tax dispute.

“Teton County would present its evidence,” Neubecker said. “And then the property owner would have an opportunity to present their evidence about why they feel that they are in compliance, or they can rebut our evidence.”
One Wilson resident received four notices of violation last year, but was was out of town receiving medical treatment. Five other county property owners received three notices in 2024.
The Town of Jackson, which passed new bear-proofing regulations later, only requires the cans on its periphery in a “bear conflict zone” that skirts the Bridger-Teton National Forest and Tribal Trail Road. Town data was not included in the News&Guide’s request.
Getting canned
After receiving a county violation letter last fall, Navarro enthusiastically got a new can.

John Hebberger Jr. submitted this photo of a black bear in Jackson to the Jackson Hole News&Guide’s “Field Notes” section in September 2024. Last year was a deadly year for Teton County black bears, which get much less attention than their cousins, the grizzly bears. (John Hebberger Jr./Jackson Hole News&Guide)
“It’s just making smart choices so that we can coexist with the wildlife in our neighborhood,” Navarro said. “They were here first.”
Lea Fine, who also lives along Highway 390, concedes she didn’t always latch her older trash can properly. When Fine knew the bears were afoot, particularly in the fall, she latched her can. But she wasn’t so ardent about it when the bears weren’t as top-of-mind.
Fine knows she lives in bear country and her relationship with the animals is nuanced. She likes bears but also wants to let her dogs out. Sometimes, even that can feel risky, she said, talking with the News&Guide in her front yard.
“It’s pretty cool that you get to see these animals up close,” she said. “But it’s a little scary.”
After receiving one violation, Fine updated her can. She rented a can from her trash hauler.
For the planning department, Fine and Navarro’s decision to get new cans — not to mention Sidewinders’ and Repinski’s — represent progress, shrinking the county’s known list of violators.
“The list used to be bigger, and now it’s smaller,” Graykowski said.
People and bears
Bears and people are better and safer apart from each other, said Boyce, the bear biologist.
Bruins that do regularly get into garbage develop a taste for human food. “That’s something that they never forget,” Boyce said. The bears become more persistent and spend more time searching for garbage around people. That leads to conflicts, which can be “destructive and potentially dangerous,” Boyce said. Sometimes it can lead Game and Fish to euthanize bears.
In some areas, like Teton Village, Game and Fish has begun to see progress. The wildlife management agency recorded only one conflict last year in the village even though the area used to be a hotspot for conflicts, Boyce said.
“We made some serious progress up there with the garbage storage,” he added.
Teton County’s enforcement is promising, Boyce said.
“I fully support it,” he added.

Joe Wilson in the 2nd District. (Photo courtesy of Pruitt4Congress)COLUMBIA — A bankruptcy attorney and part-time professor at South Carolina State University announced a bid to oust U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, promising to work across party lines should he be successful.
Democrat Roger Pruitt of Columbia, who filed his candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on May 19, said in a release Tuesday that he genuinely believes “in putting our country first.”
“I’m more than willing to collaborate with anyone — whether Democrat, Republican, or Independent — who genuinely wants to tackle the fundamental issues we face together,” he said in the release.
Like any Democrat challenging a Republican incumbent in South Carolina, Pruitt is facing long odds.
Wilson spent 17 years in the state Senate before his 2001 election to Congress to fill the vacancy created by the death of his political mentor, U.S. Rep. Floyd Spence, who represented the 2nd District for 30 years. He is the father of state Attorney General Alan Wilson.
Joe Wilson’s last two challengers each lost by about 20 points in the district that includes all of Lexington, Aiken and Barnwell counties, as well as parts of Richland and Orangeburg counties.

David Robinson II, Wilson’s 2024 opponent, is the only other Democrat to file with the FEC. No Republican has filed.
Wilson’s last competitive race was in 2020 against Democrat Adair Ford Boroughs, who lost by 13 points despite a well-financed campaign. Boroughs went on to be U.S. attorney for South Carolina during the Biden administration.
Pruitt is branding himself as a “commonsense Democrat” with a platform that emphasizes balancing the federal budget, repairing rural infrastructure, improving health care in underserved communities, overhauling the Department of Veterans Affairs and reaching across the aisle.
“I’ve seen how bad policy decisions affect real people — families losing their homes, veterans navigating broken systems, and rural communities left behind,” he said. “South Carolinians are tired of politics as usual. We want leaders who show up, listen, and get things done.”
His father spent 22 years in the Air Force, and Pruitt eventually joined the Air Force himself in 1987. He served four years, leaving in 1991 with the rank of senior airman.
After spending two decades as a paralegal, Pruitt got his law degree from the Charleston School of Law and now runs his own bankruptcy law firm. He’s taught business law classes at South Carolina State University since August 2023.
“Washington has lost touch with the people it’s supposed to serve,” said the father of five. “I’m not a career politician. I’m a veteran, an attorney, and the proud son of working-class parents who taught me the values of service, sacrifice, and personal responsibility.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Roger-Pruitt-Headshot-1024x682.png,,,2025-06-18 17:07:33.620289

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercuryAfter Tuesday’s primary election cemented state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, her opponent Republican lieutenant governor candidate John Reid on Wednesday laid out his goals if elected to the state’s second-highest office. He also announced plans to assemble work groups to study key issues and pledged that if Democrat-led efforts to enshrine reproductive rights, voting rights and same-sex marriage rights into Virginia’s constitution met a tie in the Senate chamber, he would break it by voting them all down.
With official results pending, Hashmi is apparent victor in Democratic lieutenant governor primary

“It doesn’t provide protection for people who sincerely don’t agree with gay marriage,” he said of the proposed amendment to protect same-sex marriage at a press conference outside Falling Creek Middle School in Chesterfield. “I mean, you know, I’m running to be the lieutenant governor, not to be somebody’s pastor, but I’ve got to protect everybody’s rights.”
Reid’s comments highlighted the weight the amendments will carry among candidates and voters in the legislative races this fall. All 100 House of Delegates seats are up for election, as well as the state’s full slate of executive branch roles.
Having passed the legislature once already, the amendments must pass again next year before appearing on statewide ballots for voters to finally approve or reject. The reproductive rights amendment has only advanced so far because of Democrats’ majorities in both the House and Senate chamber, while the amendment to restore voting rights to former felons who’ve completed prison sentences and to remove a defunct 2006 ban on gay marriage have advanced with bipartisan support. 
While the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled to protect gay marriage, after it reversed its decision on reproductive rights, Justice Clarence Thomas expressed interest in revisiting its 2015 same-sex marriage decision. If the conservative-leaning high court struck down federal same-sex marriage protections, Virginia’s ban on gay marriage would still be embedded in its own constitution. 
Reid explained that he thinks the proposal could be a burden or moral issue for religious people who might be in positions to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples or be asked to officiate gay wedding ceremonies.

He added that he thinks ex-felons should continue to petition governors for a possibility to vote again, rather than automatically have that right restored. Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration broke with the precedent of former governors, which granted automatic eligibility for voting rights restoration to felons who completed their sentences, by requiring ex-offenders to petition to be granted the right to vote;  grantee totals  have fallen under Youngkin’s tenure.
Reid said he believes the reproductive rights amendment could allow for “day-of-birth” abortions. In Virginia law, abortions are only allowed after the second trimester if three physicians certify it would threaten the parents’ life or mental health “irremediably” and infanticide is already illegal at the state and federal level. 
Meanwhile Reid’s stance on the amendments is in alignment with Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, the state’s current lieutenant governor, who has left notes on both the marriage equality and reproductive rights amendments signaling her moral opposition to the measures. She has distanced herself from Reid, dropping out of a rally planned for late April, where they would have shared the stage with Youngkin. Earle-Sears and Youngkin canceled their appearances but Reid held the event anyway. 
Reid said Wednesday that Earle-Sears has still not reached out to him. 
“I’m disappointed in that. But what am I supposed to do?” he asked.
Jones edges Taylor in Democratic attorney general primary

At a Richmond rally Tuesday night to hype up the back half of this year’s campaigns, Earle-Sears mentioned running mate Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking a second term, but did not mention Reid. 
In April, Youngkin had asked Reid to withdraw from the race after a Tumblr account with the same name as Reid’s other online profiles shared graphic sexual images. Reid balked at the suggestion and stayed in the race. He has remained supportive of Miyares and Earle-Sears’ candidacies. 
While Earle-Sears has yet to appear at events with Reid, it could happen in the months ahead, if the three Republican executive branch candidates want to campaign together as the Democratic ticket plans to do. 
DPVA chair Lamont Bagby announced the party’s slate of candidates Tuesday night, after primary polls closed. With Hashmi as their pick for lieutenant governor, Jay Jones will battle Miyares for the attorney general title and Abigail Spanberger will represent Democrats in her historic race for governor against Earle-Sears. 
In a press call Wednesday morning, House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, drew a bright line between how he believes each camp is functioning in the tense months before November elections. He said Virginia’s Republican top-of-ticket candidates haven’t yet campaigned together because they have different views on certain issues.
“We have diversity with unity, and they have diversity with disunity,” Scott said. “So I think it says a lot about how they accept their diversity.” 
He also acknowledged that both the Democratic and Republican tickets are the most diverse Virginia has seen, representing a range of genders, sexualities, ethnicities and religions. Scott, the state’s first Black House Speaker, said politics in Virginia are reflective of the state’s diversity.
Both Earle-Sears and Spanberger stand to be the first woman governor of Virginia while Reid is the first openly gay candidate to run for statewide office in Virginia. Attorney General Jason Miyares is already the first Hispanic person elected to statewide office and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, would be the second woman lieutenant governor and first Muslim person in a statewide office in Virginia if she wins.

Reid said he hopes his party’s policy priorities will carry them across the finish line in November, touting its efforts to give parents more input on public education choices. He noted his support of previous Republican efforts to create school choice vouchers or savings accounts parents could access if they wish to send their children to schools outside of their districts. 
When asked how else he thinks the state could support schools that are struggling with student-to-teacher ratios or infrastructure and funding, he said that helping students switch schools could ultimately help the ratios at overcrowded ones. 
He took aim at his opponent, Hashmi, for her views on education. As chair of the Senate’s education committee, she has been a bottleneck for GOP efforts like the voucher and savings account proposals. 
Calling her “radical,” Reid opposed Hashmi’s goals of increased funding for public schools. During her time as senator she has pressed for funding to boost the number of teachers and specialists, and had advocated for infrastructure and technology upgrades to under-funded schools. 
Over the course of the summer, Reid will be taking himself to policy school by assembling roundtables of various experts and potential constituents with different lived experiences that can share insights on different topics.
“I’m putting together a series of meetings with policy experts, parents, and business people who have a stake in the results of the problems that we’re dealing with in Virginia — and it’s not going to all be Republicans at the table,” he said. 
Details on when those will happen should be announced in the near future, his campaign said. 
It’s unclear exactly what Reid thinks of the massive federal funding cuts the Trump administration is pursuing, which could affect Virginians on Medicaid and have already resulted in thousands of federal worker layoffs.
“Donald Trump’s in Washington. I got to fix what’s happening in Richmond, and I got to make this a better state for Virginia,” he said in response to questions about his view on the administration’s actions. “It doesn’t do us any good to constantly scream about Donald Trump when we have problems that we can address ourselves here.”
Reid did say he thinks the “tone” of the administration’s messaging about the plan to slash funds was wrong, citing former Trump advisor Elon Musk brandishing a chainsaw on stage in a symbolic demonstration of the cuts. 
As a former communications director for former U.S. Senator George Allen (who was also governor at one point), and as a former journalist and radio talk show host, Reid emphasized his experience questioning systems and fostering debate. As a first-time politician he also said constituents won’t have to worry he is beholden to special interest groups or fellow lawmakers. 
“I’m going to come into the Capitol with a fresh set of eyes,” he said. “I don’t owe anybody anything.”

While the $4 million adds an extra 10% to the line’s appropriated budget over the current year, and will add some additional trains to the line, advocates are concerned it won’t go far enough. Gov. Ned Lamont and the state Department of Transportation say funding for Shore Line East must be balanced with other rail service priorities, and they want to monitor ridership on the coastal route before committing to further increases.
The funding boost came after Senate Bill 714, which would have restored service on the line to pre-pandemic levels, failed to come up for a vote in either chamber during the waning days of the General Assembly’s 2025 session. Annual state funding for Shore Line East currently stands at roughly half where it was before the pandemic, and estimates for restoring full service to the line vary from $25 million to over $80 million. 
According to the state Department of Transportation, nearly $40 million is authorized in the current state budget for Shore Line East in 2026 and $41 million for 2027. By comparison, the Hartford Line received roughly $60 million per year in the current budget.
The additional $4 million, secured for the second year of the biennial 2026-27 budget, comes on top of a $5 million boost Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, pushed to include in the current biennium budget. That funding came out of remaining federal COVID emergency funds. 
The added funding will only expand service by a few trips a day between the shoreline’s nine communities. But Cohen, who co-chairs the legislature’s Transportation Committee, said it’s a start.
“We still have more work to do to restore service to pre-pandemic levels, but I am proud that we were able to secure an additional $4 million this year on top of the $5 million I secured in the last budget,” said Cohen, on whose request the sum was added as a line item in this year’s budget. 
Shore Line East is the smallest of Connecticut’s six commuter rail lines, and it currently runs 20 daily trains, according to the DOT. It faced struggles beginning in 2018, when Amtrak’s seasonal track work reduced services significantly, advocates say. Then several incidents of trains malfunctioning further set back ridership. 
“We kind of limped our way through, and then we got to COVID,” said Susan Feaster, founder of SLE Riders Advocacy Group. “So even before COVID, our numbers were starting to go down.” 
In 2019, Shore Line East ran 36 daily trains, but COVID-19 led to further service reductions across all of the state’s commuter rail lines. In 2023, after budget cuts reduced the route’s service by another seven trains, the line was then running only 16 trains. 
At the same time, other routes were seeing ridership rebound. The Hartford and the Waterbury lines, which have received millions in state investments to upgrade infrastructure and service, have exceeded pre-pandemic ridership levels. But those lines also serve some of the more densely-populated cities in Connecticut. 

Last year, with the $5 million in American Rescue Plan funding, Shore Line East was able to add four weekday trains, along with round-trip direct service between Stamford and New London. While the ARPA funds were temporary, the $4 million secured in the next budget should help sustain that additional service.
For the last year, the line saw ridership just over a quarter of its pre-pandemic level. And last July, the line only carried only 18,559 riders as compared to over 60,000 in July of 2019. November was the line’s single best month since March 2020, with a total of 20,840 trips. 
While the full impact of the four reinstated trains is still unclear — and DOT officials say they need more data — advocates estimate ridership has increased by 50%. 
Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the governor’s administration wants to improve rail service by encouraging more housing development near transit, adding express trains to New York, and establishing a new bridge between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme — all of which is expected to speed up and improve service. 
Shore Line East, Blanchard said, would cost more to restore to full service than any other rail line. “The current per-passenger-trip subsidy for Shore Line East is significantly more than any other mass transit option in the state,” Blanchard said. “We must balance the overall fiscal health of the [state’s transportation fund] with services that deliver value for Connecticut residents and businesses.”
The current subsidy per ride for Shore Line East is $183, as compared to the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line’s $6.48 subsidy per ride. Comparably,  in 2021 when ridership for Shore Line East began to drop, its subsidy per rider was $55.28.
Advocates maintain the line must be reinstated to full service. 
Jim Gildea, Chairman of the Connecticut Public Transportation Council said, “Restoring Shore Line East to full service will not only improve accessibility but also strengthen our public transportation network, ensuring that it meets the needs of all Connecticut residents.”
Feaster said Shore Line East has received less support than other lines.  “It seems like every time our numbers are good, they keep changing the target for us,” she said. “Lamont said one of the problems was that we didn’t have enough housing down here, which was not a criteria for any other branch line– Danbury [or] Waterbury.”  
Feaster and Gildea both argue that restoring more trains to the line is what helps build ridership, and not the other way around.
“With last year’s funding of $5 million, we are witnessing a dedicated effort to enhance our rail services, which is vital for attracting riders back to the line,” Gildea said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/branford_train.jpg,,,2025-06-18 17:07:33.620289

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
States move to outlaw popular ‘Glock switches’ that make some guns fully automatic

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

– Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery, MetroHealth medical center, Cleveland




In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

(Screenshot from State House livestream)As negotiators with the New Hampshire House and Senate were preparing to call it a day after hours of debate on the state budget Tuesday, three protesters walked into the hearing room and pretended to fall dead.
Those demonstrators, opposed to the Republican-controlled Legislature’s proposed changes to Medicaid, were arrested over the incident by New Hampshire State Police troopers guarding the State House. The three arrested were Lisa Beaudoin, 54, of Concord; Sarah Chapman, 44, of Nottingham; and Juliana Good, 25, of Newmarket, according to court documents. They have each been charged with disorderly conduct.
The State Police wrote in court records that the three “knowingly refused to comply with a lawful order from a New Hampshire State Trooper to move out of Room 210 of the Legislative Office Building, a public place, in Concord, NH, so that the sensitive contents of the room could be secured at the end of business.”
Lawmakers are considering including a number of changes to Medicaid in this year’s budget legislation. A Senate proposal would add work requirements to the program. Gov. Kelly Ayotte has also proposed charging some Medicaid recipients premiums and increasing the amount Medicaid recipients must pay for their prescriptions. The House and Senate have both taken up Ayotte’s measures, but have been debating the details of how to implement the premiums.
Medicaid proponents have mounted a last-minute campaign urging lawmakers to reverse course on those changes. The three arrested Tuesday were part of the “Hands Off Medicaid” campaign.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/protestarrest-1024x513.jpeg,,,2025-06-18 17:07:33.620289

While reporters have repeatedly asked Hall on whether he’d commit to finishing the budget on time, the Republican speaker continuously failed to offer any assurance that the chamber would meet the state’s July 1 budget deadline. 
Although lawmakers are required to pass a new state budget by the end of June each year, the deadline carries no legal penalties if lawmakers fail to come to an agreement on funding. 
With the new fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1, Hall asserted at a January press conference that the House’s constitutional responsibility was to deliver a budget by Sept. 30. While the House would work to have the budget complete by July 1, Hall told reporters at a press conference Wednesday that the budget may not be complete until the end of September. 
Hall’s comments have sparked concern from Democratic members of the Senate and some Republicans, alongside several education groups, who rely on lawmakers to finalize the budget before July 1, with the fiscal year for Michigan School districts ending on June 30.
On Tuesday, State Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton), who chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on PreK-12, criticized Hall and several other lawmakers for traveling to Washington, D.C. to meet with members of the Trump administration rather than negotiating a spending plan.

“We’re here on the floor working hard, not only still figuring out budget priorities and discussions, but we’ve been working on legislation while House Republicans are in D.C. kissing the ring of the president,” Camilleri said. “We have very different priorities, and that’s very clear from the contrast this week.”
At the beginning of Wednesday’s press conference, Hall said the trip was “perfectly timed” with Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer departing on a weeklong trip to build up trade ties with Australia.
“If you’re going to pick a day to go to Washington, D.C. and meet with the cabinet and a lot of the departments and meet with the Domestic Policy Council, picking a day when Whitmer is in Australia is actually a pretty well coordinated day, because you can’t get a budget done without Gretchen Whitmer, we all know that,” Hall said. 
With the House passing its K-12 and its higher education budget through the chamber last week, Hall said they’d given Democrats ample time to negotiate. 
Tracy Wimmer, a spokesperson for Michigan House Democrats, said that was “a very interesting take,” calling attention to the limited days remaining and noting that passing a budget by July 1 is a vital responsibility of the Legislature.

Camilleri contended that if it were up to him and his House counterpart Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw Township) they could likely have a deal on the education budget by the deadline, pointing to Hall as the hitch in the conversation. 
However, Hall argued Democrats were to blame and that the opposing party never intended to pass the budget on time, pointing to comments from State Sen. Mallory McMorrow in November that Hall could trigger a government shutdown. 
“I’ve always preferred to get this done by July 1. I just am dealing with a group of people that are not serious about getting it done,” Hall said. 
Camilleri said the goal was for both chambers to have their spending plans ready to go by July 1, with the Senate meeting its obligation by passing spending plans for both education and the general government months ago. 
With lawmakers off Thursday in recognition of Juneteenth, the Senate only has three session days on the calendar to come to an agreement on a budget by the deadline, while the House has four. 
While Hall said he’d work to have the K-12 budget finalized by July 1, he argued it makes more sense for the remainder of the budget to be finalized by September 30 as House Republicans examine the general government budget for items to cut. 
“When you’re really digging into the programs, you don’t want unintended consequences to cuts. You want to ensure that you’re getting the most value for your dollars,” Hall said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3510-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 17:07:33.620289

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Students entering Florida for higher education may want to keep an eye on the price tag now that universities have permission to increase tuition on out-of-state students.
Out-of-state tuition has not been changed at any public institution in Florida since 2012, when University of South Florida raised it to $491 per credit hour. At Florida State University, out-of-state tuition for graduate students has not increased since 2004. 
The State University System Board of Governors handed authority to university trustees to increase out-of-state tuition by up to 15%, if they so choose. 
The policy passed has two phases, permitting an increase of out-of-state tuition up to 10% for students enrolled in fall 2025 and up to 15% for students enrolled in 2026. 
“We really are thrilled” that the schools will have the option to raise tutition, University of North Florida President Moez Limayem said.
Limayem said he is interested in having more than two years to increase tuition to avoid a sharp increase in a two-year span.
Florida out-of-state tuition is the third lowest in the country at $21,690, ranking behind North Dakota and South Dakota. The average nationwide is $30,780.
If every institution increased out-of-state tuition by 15%, the board estimates revenue could increase by $105 million. 
The opportunity to raise tuition was approved unanimously. 
The board voted, too, to require institutions to maintain the same ratio of in-state and out-of-state students as they had enrolled in fall of 2024. 
In-state tuition has not been raised since 2013.

What do Nazis, fascists, incels, skinheads, misogynists, insurrectionists and Proud Boys all have in common? Many  of them confide in reporter Elle Reeve.
It was around 2015 and Reeve was reporting for Vice News about the rise of the “alt right,” a term coined by its leader, Richard Spencer. She spent time on internet message boards like 4chan and 8chan where far right activists communicated, trolled liberals, and began to coalesce as a movement. These were often ordinary people who increasingly embraced conspiracy theories and violence.
This was during the presidency of Barack Obama, when many people were imagining that the U.S. was in the glow of a “post-racial” era. Reeve knew better. 
“Racism wasn’t dying off with an older generation,” she told the Vermont Conversation. “There was a strong beating heart right there on the internet.”
In 2017, Reeve was there when the alt right burst out of obscure Internet chat rooms and into public consciousness in a violent attack in Charlottesville, Virginia. Her documentary account, “Charlottesville: Race and Terror,” earned her and Vice News Tonight a Peabody Award, four Emmys and a George Polk Award.
In 2019, Reeve became a correspondent for CNN, where she works today. She was at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 reporting on the attack on Congress by Trump supporters, many of whom she knew well.
Why do they talk to her? “They want to tell their story, they want to confess, they want to unburden themselves,” she said.
Reeve’s recent book is “Black Pill: How I Witnessed the Darkest Corners of the Internet Come to Life, Poison Society, and Capture American Politics.” The title refers to how far right activists speak of taking the “black pill” of nihilism to justify their cruelty and violence. “It’s this dark nihilism that the world is doomed. There’s nothing you can do to change it, and you at best, can hope for it to collapse.”
Reeve traces how far-right rhetoric has moved from the fringes to the mainstream, with Donald Trump and J.D. Vance channeling extremist ideas and language.
Vance has denounced the “woke ideology” of “white women who are miserable about their own lives, enforcing codes about racial justice, gay rights on other people to make other people miserable, to account for how miserable they are in their own lives,” Reeve explained.
Vance’s use of the term “childless cat ladies” is another far right meme. “I’ve read that on 4chan six or seven years ago,” said Reeve. “It has trickled upward.”
Another far right notion that is now embraced by mainstream Republicans is that diversity is bad. “They think that racial and ethnic and gender diversity makes us weaker. It makes us fools. This is just something that they ridiculed all the time.”
Reeve explained the far right context of Trump’s attacks on people of color. “If a white person commits a crime in their world, it’s because they’re a bad guy. But if a Black person commits a crime in their world, it’s because they’re Black.”
Reeve warned that many people “are vulnerable to those ideas. I just interviewed a ton of people who were so nice to me at a Trump boat parade. They were so nice to me, and then they started talking to me about how it’s not right to eat people’s cats, and these people do animal sacrifice, and they’re dirty and they bring disease.”
“It’s not all crazy people who believe this stuff. It’s regular people and your neighbors,” said Reeve. “You have an obligation to push back against that, whether or not they’ll listen to you.”
Reeve said about the future, “There has been an escalating radicalization among the Republican elite and a softening among the voters. … People speak freely about civil war. That is dangerous.”
“I don’t like it but I don’t know where that balance ends up after the election. You can’t do something like Jan. 6 without a feeling that there’s an army behind you of supporters who will back you up.”

Meet Kate and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
After three years and 1.3 million texts and phone calls, the national LGBTQ+ suicide prevention hotline is shutting down. The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it was ending LGBTQ+ services for 988, the crisis hotline for queer youth that launched in 2022. 
“Everyone who contacts the 988 Lifeline will continue to receive access to skilled, caring, culturally competent crisis counselors who can help with suicidal, substance misuse, or mental health crises, or any other kind of emotional distress,” the administration said in an announcement. “Anyone who calls the Lifeline will continue to receive compassion and help.” 
The statement does not specify why services specific to LGBTQ+ callers are ending. 
LGBTQ+ rights organizations decried the news as a crushing blow to young queer Americans, many of whom are already suffering through increasingly hostile laws and policies. 
“This is devastating, to say the least,” said Jaymes Black, CEO of the queer youth suicide prevention organization Trevor Project, in a statement. “Suicide prevention is about people, not politics. The administration’s decision to remove a bipartisan, evidence-based service that has effectively supported a high-risk group of young people through their darkest moments is incomprehensible.”
The announcement came on the eve of the Supreme Court’s ruling in the United States vs. Skrmetti, in which the court upheld a Tennessee law barring gender-affirming care for transgender minors. The ruling is expected to bolster anti-transgender medical bans for youth in 25 states and risks undercutting constitutional protections for all transgender people. 
Over the last five years, LGBTQ+ people have increasingly been the target of hostile policy and political attacks. Against that backdrop, the 988 hotline was praised as a lifeline for young people in desperate need of support. But the Trump administration’s moves to unravel diversity, equity and inclusion policies have undercut services for LGBTQ+ people broadly. 
The Trevor Project, which staffs its own crisis line, worked with the federal government to field approximately 50 percent of the 988 calls. Six other providers also do that work. According to the Trevor Project, it served 231,000 crisis contacts last year alone.The organization reports that LGBTQ+ youth are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide as their straight cisgender peers. According to their 2023 survey, roughly half of transgender and nonbinary youth had seriously considered suicide, and 41 percent of queer youth overall had.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP23284551126899-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 17:07:33.620289

Maxwell Frost on Wednesday introduced federal legislation that would strengthen public accountability of all Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities.
Frost argued that ICE agents are abusing the rule of law, skirting due process, and targeting nonviolent working people.
  Maxwell Frost via U.S. House
His bill — called the Stop Unlawful Detention and End Mistreatment Act — would require all ICE-operated and affiliated facilities to publicly list all individuals who are being detained, where they are being detained, when they’ve been detained, and why.
The legislation would also require ICE facilities to provide information regarding the age, nationality, and legal status of those detained, as well as data on any use of force when they were being detained, along with information if they were transferred to another facility or deported out of the country.
The provisions would also cover local jails contracting with ICE.
“We’re talking about mothers, fathers, grandparents, taxpayers, even folks showing up for their immigration hearings,” Frost said at a press conference held at his district office in Orlando about those being taken in by ICE agents. “It’s a culture of fear and chaos.”
The representative went on to say that even U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained under Florida’s recently passed immigration law (enforcement of which has been suspended by a federal judge).
While congressional Democrats have expressed outrage regarding ICE’s actions for months, a Pew Research Center survey of more than 5,000 U.S. adults published on Tuesday showed that Americans have more mixed views of the Trump administration’s immigration actions this year, with opinions about specific policies largely split along partisan lines, with Republicans supportive and Democrats opposed.
On the specific issue of ICE raids on workplaces where undocumented migrants may be working, 54% said they disapproved of those actions, with 45% supporting the raids (the survey was conducted before the recent high-profile ICE raid on workplaces in Los Angeles).
Confrontations
In the past month, ICE agents have had physical confrontations with Democratic party lawmakers in incidents across the country.

New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested on Tuesday by federal agents at an immigration court after he linked arms with a person authorities were attempting to detain.
California U.S. Senator Alex Padilla was shoved to the ground and handcuffed by federal agents at a Homeland Security press conference in Los Angeles  last week.
New Jersey Democratic U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver was indicted last week by a grand jury following charges of assaulting two federal agents during a confrontation outside an ICE detention facility in Newark.

Joining Frost at his press conference were immigration advocates who said the legislation is badly needed.
“The Number One problem that we’re having in the community, especially in Orange County, is the fact that our people are disappearing. Immigrants are disappearing from the county jail,” said Ericka Tejeda-Gomez of the Immigrants are Welcome Here Coalition.
There are two reasons for that, she said, the first being the 287(g) agreements that 292 local law enforcement agencies in Florida have signed with the federal government to assist in immigration enforcement. The second reason are the additional agreements between Florida law enforcement and ICE regarding the delivery of those detainees.
“The moment that that person bonds out, they disappear from the jail system and there is no way of knowing if they’re still there, [or] if they have been sent to Krome [a detention center in Miami], if they’ve been sent to Texas, if they’ve been sent to New Mexico,” Tejeda-Gomez said.
“This is why it’s most imperative that bills like this ensure that, at the local levels, we have a way of keeping people tracked so that they can have representation and due process.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
Conservative justices lean toward allowing Tennessee’s ban on gender affirming care

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
How to stay or when to move? Transgender laws force tough choices on Tennessee families

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities on Wednesday approved a raft of affordability measures meant to blunt the impact of a surge in electricity prices that took effect at the start of June.
In unanimous votes, the utility regulator backed orders that would defer a total of $60 from summer electricity bills, extend $175 in bill credits to low-income ratepayers, waive reconnection fees, and extend winter shutoff protections through July, August, and September.
“Sometimes, we don’t have the opportunity to thank our utilities enough. They really stepped up to the plate very quickly,” said BPU Commissioner Zenon Christodoulou. “It wasn’t their doing, that these prices went up, but they really are taking a lot of the brunt of this and we really appreciate their efforts. They came to us and they came up with plans as quickly as we could imagine.”
The deferred bill program would cut $30 from monthly bills for all ratepayers in July and August, when summer heat pushes electricity usage to its peak.
Customers would repay those balances, which would not increase due to interest or carrying costs, over the following six months, said BPU Executive Director Bob Brabston.
“No customer will pay a penny more as a result of this, and all customers will benefit by having their typically high summer bills eased somewhat as part of this proposal,” Brabston told the board.
Qualifications for summer shutoff protections are identical to those in the Winter Termination Program. Residents who are enrolled in certain assistance programs — like the federally funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, among others — or receive state or local utility assistance are eligible for winter shutoff protections.
The deferred bill program, which would require submissions from the state’s four regulated utilities by July 1, also would bar summer shutoffs for ratepayers protected by Linda’s Law, which requires utilities to wait 90 days before discontinuing services over nonpayment for customers who use life-sustaining medical equipment powered by electricity.
They also call for utilities to offer deferred payment agreements lasting up to 24 months, compared to the 12 now required under state law. Those agreements are separate to the bill deferral program for July and August.
The actions are regulators’ latest effort to defray the impact of a steep rise in electricity supply costs that pushed rates up by roughly 20% at the start of June.
Democratic officials have blamed the cost hikes on PJM Interconnection, the state’s grid operator, for delays in connecting renewable projects to the grid.
“It is not perfect. There is no silver bullet here,” BPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy said Wednesday. “These generation cost increases are outside of the (regulated utilities). They’re outside of the control of this agency, but it doesn’t mean that we don’t all share some responsibility to help to reduce costs, particularly in these very, very high-usage months.”
Republicans have charged Gov. Phil Murphy’s renewables-heavy energy agenda stalled new generation in the state, leading to the supply-demand imbalance that’s driving up costs.
On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Tony Bucco (R-Morris) called the board’s latest moves a politically motivated election-year effort.
“The problem is it doesn’t fix the problem. It’s just an election-year gimmick to get them past another election,” Bucco said. “This is something we have to address: How are we going to fix this? And really, the only way to fix it is to increase supply here in New Jersey.”
He said officials could instead take up Republican proposals that would, among other things, suspend the imposition of sales tax on energy.
The BPU on Wednesday approved the first phase of the Garden State Energy Storage Program. That program aims to award contracts for between 350 megawatts and 700 megawatts by Oct. 31.
A different order approved by the board will extend $48.7 million in Residential Energy Assistance Program credits to ratepayers eligible for winter-shutoff protections.
Those credits would be applied to seven monthly bills beginning in August and ending February 2026 in equal installments of $25, for a total benefit of $175. The benefit was first paid last year, but it was applied as a one-time $175 credit to August utility bills.
Credits under the Residential Energy Assistance Program are separate from a $430 million plan Murphy, lawmakers, and regulators announced earlier in June.
That program, which the BPU has not yet approved, promises a $100 benefit to all New Jersey ratepayers with an additional $150 for those who qualify for the Winter Termination Program.
In a separate vote, the board approved higher award levels under the Universal Service Fund, a utility assistance program administered by the Department of Community Affairs that applies monthly credits to low- and moderate-income households.
The floor for monthly utility credits under the Universal Service Fund will rise to $20, from $5, in October, while maximum monthly credit would increase from $180 to $200.
Of the roughly 226,000 who received benefits from the Universal Service Fund last year, about 136,000 received the smallest possible credits, while approximately 8,000 got the maximum allowed amount.

Senate majority leader predicts budget deadline will be blown,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/pa-senate-majority-leader-predicts-budget-deadline-will-be-blown/,"“I see no practical way that a budget will be completed on June 30,” Sen. Joe Pittman told reporters Wednesday.","Sen. Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) discusses ongoing budget negotiations with reporters (Capital-Star photo by Ian Karbal)State lawmakers have been scrambling to finalize next year’s state budget by the statutory deadline of June 30. But Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana), one of the most important figures in negotiations, says there’s little chance they’ll make it.
“I see no practical way that a budget will be completed on June 30,” he told reporters Wednesday. “We are engaged in conversations, but those conversations have not gone as quickly as we would prefer.”
Pittman added most Pennsylvanians won’t feel any pain.
“On July 1, the sun will come up and I don’t think the good people of Pennsylvania will see any notable difference in their daily lives,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
It wouldn’t be the first time lawmakers have blown a deadline on a spending plan in recent years. That’s in part because of the partisan power divide in state government. Democrats have the governor’s mansion and a narrow majority in the House, while Republicans control the  Senate. 
The dynamic has led to both clashes and compromises.
Pittman expressed some optimism about a deal being reached reasonably close to the deadline, noting some broad agreements exist between Democrats and Republicans. Most importantly, he said, is the consensus that the budget, which currently operates on a deficit, needs balancing.
“I’m encouraged that it seems that all of the parties in the building understand that we do have a structural deficit, and understand that we must figure out a way to deal with that,” he said.
But how to address that could be an issue.
Pittman said there are “two fundamental pillars” that he believes need to be addressed. One is what to do about Medicaid spending, which Gov. Josh Shapiro has proposed increasing by $2 billion
“If that number really is a $2 billion increase, I can tell you there’s not going to be a lot to talk about otherwise,” Pittman said. “If we have to carry that kind of increase, which then parlays into an even greater increase the following year, we have no capacity to do anything in this budget.”
Pittman said potential solutions could include limiting coverage of GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Ozempic, and requiring greater “cost sharing” for more Medicaid enrollees.
Negotiations are happening as members in the U.S. Congress weigh large cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs like SNAP that could increase the state share of responsibility for the programs.
The other priority for Pittman and Senate Republicans is regulation of skill games, which resemble video gambling machines.
They have proliferated around Pennsylvania corner stores, gas stations and smoke shops and are currently unregulated, which Pittman said has led to both public safety issues and the loss of potential revenue.
What that regulation looks like, however, is still up in the air. But taxing the machines could net the state some money to fill their deficit.
Asked at a separate press conference about Pittman’s assessment, Shapiro provided few details.
“I think we understand the issues that need to be addressed,” he said. “I’m not suggesting we’ve agreed on the answers on how to address them.”
Shapiro added this year’s lift could be lighter than last year’s, when a Commonwealth Court ruling forced lawmakers to reassess the state’s public education funding formula.

Pittman said if a deal could not be reached within a reasonable timeframe after the statutory budget deadline, he’s open to passing a short-term budget that would fund the government and allow lawmakers more time to negotiate.
A spokesperson for House Democrats did not respond to a specific question about the likelihood of the June 30 deadline being blown, but instead pointed to a provided a statement highlighting work Democrats have already done.
“The House Democratic majority is a pragmatic group that has passed numerous budget-related bills to provide for adult use cannabis, to provide working families a raise through an increase to the minimum wage, and to invest in the stability of our energy sector and increase production in the future,” Beth Rementer, a spokesperson for the caucus said in an email.
“We stand ready to send the governor’s proposed budget to the Senate. But we also acknowledge in divided government, we must work together to pass a final compromise,” she added. “We have been waiting patiently to see what the Senate can pass — preferably before or not long after June 30.”
In February, Shapiro unveiled a proposed budget that would have had the state dip into its surplus funds to cover a roughly $1.6 billion deficit. It also included revenue from legal cannabis, which would require the legislature to pass a bill establishing a regulatory framework.
Pittman said that Democratic efforts to legalize cannabis are unlikely to pass this year. Senators in both parties were critical of a proposal that emerged from the House that would have allowed cannabis sold in state-owned stores like liquor.
Funding of public transit has also been a source of contention between Senate Republicans and House Democrats. Advocates have warned that public transit services, especially SEPTA, which serves the Philadelphia area, will likely cut services and raise fares without help from the state. Republicans have generally objected, saying the funding primarily helps those in urban areas, and would have to be paired with funding for roads and bridges throughout the state.
A bill to increase mass transit funding by roughly $300 million passed the House this week. Similar legislation has been passed in the Democratic-controlled chamber before, with no action in the Senate. The bill would also provide $500 million for road and bridge repair.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Pittman-on-budget-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-06-18 16:06:34.623713

(Rebecca S. Gratz for the Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Department of Correctional Services on Wednesday selected which construction company will build the state’s next prison: Hausmann Construction of Lincoln.
Correctional Services said the Lincoln-headquartered company was the lowest base bidder for the project, at $313.3 million, compared to the joint ventures of Sampson Construction/Caddell Construction ($344.3 million) and Clark Construction/MCL Construction ($341 million). One partner in each of the joint ventures was Nebraska-based.

The Nebraska Legislature appropriated $350 million for building a replacement prison, but some lawmakers worried rising construction costs could push the project over.
Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys said Wednesday that the bids came “well below” similar construction projects in other states, and he reaffirmed that the project would stay on budget. The three construction ventures were publicly named Monday, but bid totals were not released until Wednesday. 
The department said other costs adjacent to construction, such as land and dirt work, would stay within the state appropriation or other department funding.
“As with any NDCS construction project, there will be ongoing evaluation for efficiencies,” a news release states.

The 1,512-bed facility, once built, will be located north of Interstate 80, adjacent to North 70th Street, close to Lincoln.
Hausmann’s recent construction projects include the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Osborne Legacy Complex, Bob Devaney Sports Center renovation and Westbrook Music Hall replacement; expansions for the Lincoln Children’s Zoo and Pillen Family Farms; the Douglas County Treasurer and 911 Operations Center; the Joint Forces Headquarters Building for the Nebraska National Guard; Central Nebraska Veterans Home; multiple Lincoln Fire and Rescue stations and many elementary, middle and high schools.
Jeffreys said the procedural “intent to award” signing with Hausmann “marks an important step forward in our mission to create a safer, more effective correctional system.”
“Hausmann Construction is a local company who understands our commitment to fiscal responsibility, completing this project the Nebraska way,” Jeffreys said. “Their sub-contractors are high-performing and many are local — keeping business in Nebraska. We are ready to work side by side to bring this vision to life for our staff, our state and those we serve.”
The department will continue finalizing the contract with Husmann. The state expects construction to begin in early fall.

June 17, 2025. | Photo by Jackson ColemanProtestors rallied on Tuesday at Sam’s Club in Southfield to speak out against Walmart’s choice to end its diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, programs. A group of activists stood outside the store entrance hoisting signs and voicing chants. They talked to shoppers and asked them to support other stores that stand for “fairness and equality.”
Sam’s Club is a chain of membership-only warehouse club retail stores in the United States owned by Walmart. The Associated Press reported last November that Walmart was “rolling back its diversity, equity and inclusion policies.”
“Now, we will see if Walmart is equally committed to racism,” Erik Shelley, a Michigan United spokesperson, said. He added that the effort is part of the social action group’s “Week of Resistance for Juneteenth.”
Juneteenth is a holiday that celebrates the end of slavery in a section of the United States. It recognizes June 19, 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were told they were free, more than two years after then-President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation that sought to end slavery. Former U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in 2021 that made Juneteenth a federal holiday. It was first celebrated last year as an official state holiday in Michigan.
Michigan United worked with groups like Oakland Forward, Black Women’s Roundtable, and the Detroit Council of Baptist Pastors. Together, they have planned a week of action to stand up for civil rights.
During the week, Michigan United lifted up what it calls  “Buycott,” which means asking people to shop at Black-owned businesses instead of big companies like Walmart that are not supporting DEI. Protestors gave out lists and QR codes to help people find new places to shop.
The “Week of Resistance” will end with a cookout on Saturday, June 21 at Inkster Park, beginning at 11 a.m. There will be music from DJ Too Cool Thomas, games, dancing, and food offerings including barbecue, greens, and Jollof rice. Organizers say it’s a way to celebrate Juneteenth and bring the community together.

(Photo courtesy of Homeland Security Investigations)Federal and state authorities apprehended 84 unauthorized migrants during a raid Tuesday at a horse racing track in Calcasieu Parish, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
The operation at Delta Downs near Vinton focused on businesses that own and race horses at the facility and their employees, according to an ICE news release issued Wednesday. The people arrested were processed for administrative immigration violations and taken to the U.S. Border Patrol station in Lake Charles.
Those arrested included Enrique Gonzalez Moreno, 36, from Mexico, who ICE said has illegally entered the U.S. four times. He has reportedly been convicted twice for driving under the influence, once for cocaine possession and once for illegal reentry. 
ICE also took an unnamed 40-year-old man from Mexico into custody who the agency said has previously been arrested for criminal conspiracy, aggravated battery with a dangerous weapon, sexual battery and video voyeurism.
ICE said it planned to have an update on the disposition of these criminal cases once they are verified.
Eric DeLaune, special agent in charge of ICE’s New Orleans Homeland Security Investigations office, said each case of unauthorized employment is being reviewed to determine if any other criminal activities were taking place, including labor exploitation.
“Oftentimes, when we’re conducting these worksite enforcement operations, we uncover other forms of criminal conduct such as document and benefit fraud, money laundering and human trafficking,” DeLaune said in the ICE statement.
Authorities received a tip indicating businesses at the racetrack’s stables were employing unauthorized workers, according to ICE. The information was confirmed during a subsequent on-site visit. 
Agencies that took part in the Delta Downs operation included U.S. Border Patrol, Louisiana State Police, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the FBI, the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Lake Charles Police Department.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NMNew Mexico elected officials and nonprofit leaders gathered in Albuquerque on Wednesday to acknowledge the fear in many immigrant families amid ongoing federal immigration raids — but also to reaffirm their commitment to keeping families together. 
State House Speaker Javier Martinez and Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller were among speakers at the office of El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos, each denouncing the federal immigration operations occurring throughout the state but also outlining long-standing protections Albuquerque and New Mexico residents have, regardless of immigration status. 
ICE offers Albuquerque immigrant reprieve — for now

“I will not allow a wannabe dictator in Washington, DC, to let my parents’ sacrifices and the sacrifices of all these good people behind me go to waste,” said Martinez (D-Albuquerque), referring to members of various immigration advocacy groups like El Centro joining him at the lectern.  “If they want to come after you all, they need to come through me first.”
Martinez and Keller pointed to protections against local police coordinating with federal immigration agencies, along with a recent state law that prohibits state agencies from sharing resident data, including motor vehicle data, with the federal government. 
Keller noted that the city has coordinated the distribution of 10,000 “red cards” that lay out immigrant rights, including in city schools, where the school board recently affirmed its policy prohibiting coordination with ICE. 
The news conference comes amid an increase of federal immigration operations in the state, according to the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center and other groups that represent immigrants. 
ICE arrested an Albuquerque man. He ended up in the hospital. Now no one knows where he is.

“Over the past several weeks, NMILC and our partners have observed a significant uptick in ICE arrests against community members,” said managing attorney Sophia Genovese. “Common tactics include ICE officers pulling over vehicles and detaining people, going to people’s homes and workplaces, detaining people at their immigration court hearings and appointments, and a number of other tips or tricks and bruising to effectuate the Trump administration’s mass deportation promise.”
ICE is also growing more violent, she said, “with at least one recent account of physical brutality” during an arrest. She was referring to the case of Jesus Jose Carrero-Marquez, a husband and father who was recently deported to Venezuela after living in Albuquerque with his family for at least two years. His wife told Source New Mexico last week that ICE agents threw him to the ground and put him in a chokehold, and he was hospitalized before being returned to ICE custody and ultimately deported.
According to Genovese, ICE agents conducted a mass arrest in a Walmart parking lot in Rio Rancho two weeks ago, along with “I-9 audits” where federal immigration law enforcement goes to restaurants and other businesses and asking owners for paperwork on all their employees.
“There’s a lot of ICE activity all throughout Albuquerque,” she said. 
But it’s hard to pin down when and where raids are occurring, speakers said, given the fly-by-night nature of the arrests and because city employees, including the police department, are prohibited by law from coordinating with ICE. 
NM group condemns federal raid on Lovington dairy farm

In addition to the ICE activity in New Mexico’s biggest city, the speakers noted a raid at a dairy farm by federal immigration agents recently in Lovington,, where at least 11 people were arrested. The dairy farm has since shut down, Martinez said.
“Now if the argument is that we’re a bunch of freeloaders,” Martinez said, “ask yourself, ‘why are they raiding places of work?’ They’re not catching us at the welfare line while we commit fraud to get welfare.”
According to Keller, there are 20,000 mixed-status families in Albuquerque. Across New Mexico, 63,000 immigrants are homeowners, and immigrants across the state contribute $1.4 billion in federal state and local taxes, according to data El Centro presented. 
The group also shared several anonymous quotes from families dealing with deportation, including from people whose relatives that have occurred here since Trump’s second term began. 
“There are terrible things happening in our communities,” one of them reads. “Poor, defenseless people are being dragged out of their homes. Families are being torn apart.

“I obviously appreciate that we're a little behind…the schedule that we laid out last December, but I still think we're making great progress,” said Bruce Stebbins, acting chair of the cannabis commission, about a delay on social consumption regulations.  
The post Cannabis commission plans to launch social consumption in October  appeared first on CommonWe[...]","THE CANNABIS CONTROL COMMISSION said on Tuesday that the agency is aiming to release final social consumption regulations by October of this year – later than the “mid-2025” goal that the agency had previously indicated.
The commission plans to vote on a version of the social consumption regulations in July before sending them to the Secretary of State to create an official record. Then, the agency will take public comment and hold a public hearing. The testimony will be incorporated into another draft by late August or early September, at which point the regulations would be resubmitted to the secretary and become enforceable in October.
“I obviously appreciate that we’re a little behind … the schedule that we laid out last December, but I still think we’re making great progress,” Acting Chair Bruce Stebbins told CommonWealth Beacon following the public meeting. “It’s a process [that] include[s] all of the commissioners and all of the staff input as we get further closer to the end.”
The framework in the new social consumption regulation – which was first unveiled in December 2024 – is currently set to create three proposed types of licenses. A new “supplemental” license will allow existing marijuana businesses to add a social consumption area — such as a “tasting room” — where customers can consume cannabis purchased on-site. A “hospitality” license will permit on-site cannabis consumption at both new and existing non-cannabis businesses, including lounges, yoga studios, cafes, and theaters. Finally, an “event organizer” license will enable cannabis consumption at events like festivals, provided they last no longer than five days.
The commission is still working to update the details of the regulations before it votes on them in July.
Stebbins said that even after the regulations are finalized, there will be more steps in implementing social consumption. Communities across the state will have to “opt-in” to allow social consumption, and the commission will have to approve licenses before people in Massachusetts will be able to walk into an establishment, buy a weed gummy or cannabis drink, and consume it at the location. 
Social consumption – the ability to consume cannabis products in designated public spaces – has been legal in the state since the ballot question legalizing marijuana was approved by voters in 2016, but the commission has been slow to roll out regulations to create the framework to support it.
The commission’s last major changes to the regulations – which removed the two-driver requirement for cannabis delivery – took a long time to come to fruition. Even after the commission voted to make a long-awaited change to the two-driver rule, it took nearly a year for the agency to publish the final regulations. There has been frustration in the cannabis industry around how slow the commission has been to update its regulations and write new ones to support social consumption.
The commission has been enmeshed in controversy ever since Treasurer Deborah Goldberg suspended Shannon O’Brien from her position as chair of the commission for allegedly making racially insensitive comments. There have been allegations of bullying at the agency, and the commission has failed to collect over $500,000 in licensing fees. Last June, the Inspector General called the commission a “rudderless ship” and urged lawmakers to put it under a receivership.
Currently, the five-member commission is down to three and is at risk of being deadlocked because three commissioners must all agree for the commission to take any action. The House passed a cannabis reform bill on June 4 that would restructure the commission to a three-member body appointed solely by the governor as a way of addressing some of the leadership issues. It is unclear if the Senate will take up the cannabis legislation. 
“There’s general excitement from the community and the stakeholders that have wanted [social consumption], and I think we’re getting to a point where we’re going to have regulations that will prioritize public health and safety and at the same time will [bring] exciting, new opportunities for potential licensees,” said Stebbins.

(Photo courtesy Bryce Mitchell/University of Florida)Money universities make with dorms, dining plans, bookstores, and more will partially be redirected to Florida collegiate athletes under an emergency rule approved amid the ever-changing athletics landscape. 
The State University System (SUS) Board of Governors voted Wednesday to adopt an emergency rule to allow more flexibility in paying college athletes. 
Each university is now able to use up to $22.5 million in what are known as auxiliary funds to meet their athletic budgets. 
The House v. NCAA settlement this month starts revenue sharing July 1, allowing institutions to spend up to about $20.5 million to pay athletes in the coming year with the cap rising in years following, putting an increasing financial strain on institutions that hope to remain competitive. 
The board called it a “substantial fiscal burden.”
Universities are required to contribute to back-paying former athletes who competed as long ago as 2016 over a coming 10-year period. 
Previously, auxiliary money could not be used for athletics. 
“The universities are not proposing this as a permanent solution. The universities are proposing this as a bridge,” board Vice Chair Alan Levine said. 
Schools will be required to develop plans for how to replace that funding when the temporary rule ends in 2028.
“If we don’t act, there’s a really good chance that our institutions will be severely disadvantaged and I don’t think anybody wants that,” Levine said. 
Student athletes may be drawn to an institution based on how much money the school is able to pay them, ultimately boosting schools that are able to pay for higher-profile athletes.

The rule requires that moving funds around does “not have a material impact on the university’s current credit rating or negatively impact any non-athletic auxiliary enterprise.”
Levine called for a group within the Board of Governors to convene on the topic to further guide rulemaking as the athletic environment evolves. 
The Florida House of Representatives convened a special workgroup earlier this year on name, image, and likeness legislation, but reached no major conclusion. That was before the settlement was agreed to in June. House leaders said the group will continue into the next session. 
“Athletic programs have a major impact on universities. Competitive programs can lead to brand recognition, student involvement, and increased applications from prospective students. Florida universities are competing on a national level, against other states that have more flexibility regarding funding and expenditures. Delaying the implementation date of this regulatory amendment would put SUS institutions at a distinct competitive disadvantage,” the Board of Governors said. 
The University of Florida men’s basketball took home a national title in April, Florida Atlantic University men’s basketball made the Final Four in 2023, and Florida State University women’s soccer won a national championship in 2023.

Sabrina Cervantes’ attorney says she was targeted for DUI without cause because she’s a Latina member of the LGBTQ caucus. Authorities are refusing to release records that could show who is telling the truth.,"In summary
Sen. Sabrina Cervantes’ attorney says she was targeted for DUI without cause because she’s a Latina member of the LGBTQ caucus. Authorities are refusing to release records that could show who is telling the truth. 


A Democratic California senator is now considering suing Sacramento police for what she alleges was a “politically motivated” false DUI arrest intended to “silence” an LGBTQ Latina lawmaker, her attorney tells CalMatters.Officers have insisted that they acted professionally, and they say they had evidence to believe Sen. Sabrina Cervantes was driving under the influence of drugs even though a blood test reportedly later proved otherwise.
Meanwhile, a Democratic district attorney insists that politics had nothing to do with his decision not to file charges.
Who’s telling the truth? At this point, the public has no way of corroborating anyone’s account. 
That’s because authorities are refusing to release records such as body camera footage, police reports and search warrants that would shed light on what happened on May 19 when Sacramento police accused Cervantes, of Riverside, of driving under the influence following a crash a few blocks from the Capitol. She was exonerated nearly two weeks later, after prosecutors said no intoxicating substances were found in Cervantes’ blood.
It’s troubling that officials have refused to release records pertaining to a criminal investigation of an elected public official, said David Snyder, the executive director of the First Amendment Coalition. He said the records authorities are withholding could “shed light on whether she was being harassed or whether she was being treated deferentially.”“There are a lot of different narratives flying around,” he said. “And in order to sort out those narratives, the public is entitled to see what the police know and what they believed at the time.” 
Instead, the public is left with conflicting accounts of what happened after a driver allegedly ran through a stop sign and smashed into Cervantes’ state-owned car that Monday afternoon. Police cited the other driver for running the stop sign.
Conflicting accounts of Cervantes’ treatment
After the crash, a Sacramento Police Department spokesperson told CalMatters that Cervantes was cited for suspicion of “driving a motor vehicle under the influence of a central nervous system depressant.”
When the Sacramento County district attorney announced last month that no charges would be filed, police released a second statement. In it, police claimed that when officers met Cervantes at a Sacramento hospital, they “observed objective signs that led them to believe she may have been impaired while operating a motor vehicle.” 
“The officers remained professional throughout, taking time to explain the process and answer all of the senator’s questions,” the statement said.
Officers said Cervantes initially declined to participate with officers’ sobriety tests. So they asked a judge for a warrant for Cervantes to submit to a blood test and told Cervantes they had requested one.
“While the warrant was being written and processed, the senator agreed to voluntarily provide a blood sample,” police said. Officers opted to wait for a judge to sign the warrant before conducting the blood draw, police said. 
The district attorney said prosecutors reviewed “all the submitted evidence, including police reports, witness statements, and laboratory results.”“Based on our ethical duty and the burden of proof in a criminal trial, the Sacramento County DA’s Office declines to file any charges in this case,” Shelly Orio, a spokeswoman for the office, said in a May 30 email.
Cervantes maintained her innocence from the start and claimed police treated her harshly.
In a statement to reporters after police announced the DUI arrest, she said officers “accosted” her while she was being checked out at a hospital and that drug and alcohol tests would prove her sobriety. 
Cervantes released heavily redacted records she said were from her hospital visit, in which a test showed a blood alcohol content of near zero. A separate urine test taken the day after the crash showed a clean drug screen.
Was senator targeted for race, sexual orientation?
Was Cervantes targeted for race, sexual orientation? 
On Tuesday, Cervantes’ San Francisco attorney, James Quadra, told CalMatters his client is considering filing a lawsuit alleging police violated her “state and federal rights, constitutional rights, civil rights, and to address defamatory statements made against her.”
Quadra said he and his client believe the Sacramento officers targeted Cervantes because of who she is. 
“We believe they (police) were politically motivated because of how the information was disseminated (to the press), and the whole sort of picture of her being under the influence,” he said. “To our view, it’s to try to silence an active member of the Latino Democratic Caucus, of the LGBTQ+ caucus. They want to silence her voice.”
Quadra said officers at the hospital refused to let her call her attorney or her wife, and then after citing her for DUI, “leaked” the information about the case to reporters to smear her.
“It’s like a police state,” Quadra said. “It’s what we’re seeing across the country, especially with Latinos, and she’s a member of that community.”
Sacramento police spokesperson Sgt. Dan Wiseman said he couldn’t comment on Quadra’s allegations. The department declined to make Chief Katherine Lester available for an interview.
Officials reject CalMatters’ record requests
The day after the crash, CalMatters reviewed footage from a nearby office building’s security camera that appears to show Cervantes wasn’t at fault.
The footage showed a white SUV rolling through a stop sign and careening into Cervantes’ black sedan at the intersection in midtown Sacramento. Cervantes appeared to have had the right-of-way.
CalMatters also filed requests under the California Public Records Act seeking body camera footage, police reports and the search warrant. A warrant would include investigators’ affidavits detailing to a judge why they believe they had probable cause to draw Cervantes’ blood.
A month later, the police department hasn’t released any of the records, saying the traffic collision remains under investigation, despite the district attorney clearing Cervantes and police citing the other driver. California police have broad discretion to withhold investigative records indefinitely and regardless of whether the investigation has concluded.

CalMatters also sought copies of the search warrant from Sacramento County Superior Court and the Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office. The district attorney’s office cited the same exemption to the public records act that allows agencies to indefinitely withhold investigative records.
Wiseman said officers had returned the search warrant to the court, but when CalMatters asked for it at the courthouse Tuesday a Sacramento County Superior Court clerk said it wasn’t available.
Quadra, Cervantes’ attorney, said his client is “100% behind any and all records being released.”
“She is unafraid of that, because the records will clearly establish that she wasn’t under the influence of anything,” he said. “She was a victim of an accident. She was T-boned and taken to the hospital.”
DA denies ‘partisanship’ played a role
CalMatters also sought under the public records act correspondence between the District Attorney’s Office and California lawmakers that might show whether Cervantes or other influential political figures sought to influence the decision of District Attorney Thien Ho, who is also a Democrat.
The district attorney’s office replied that it had no relevant records. But the agency refused to release Ho’s appointment calendar for the month of May, saying it was confidential and that “the public interest served by not disclosing these outweighs the public interest served by disclosing them.” Other agencies routinely release appointment calendars of top officials. 
Ho didn’t respond to an interview request through his spokesperson, replying instead with a brief emailed statement.
“Regarding your allegation of partisanship, we stand by our decision that no charges be filed since the lab results found no evidence of alcohol or drugs,” the statement said.
Snyder, of the First Amendment Coalition, said the public should be troubled by the secrecy surrounding the case.
“The public,” he said, “is entitled to know whether the police are applying the law even-handedly, or whether they’re creating exceptions based on who the person at issue is.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/012325-Capitol-Session-FG-CM-36.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-18 16:06:34.623713

Democrat Aleita Timmons was sworn in to represent House District 97. Timmons was elected to replace former Rep. Jason Lowe, D-Oklahoma City, who was elected to serve on the Oklahoma County Commission. 
Timmons, a retired judge, said the House will have a colleague who will “seek consensus where necessary” and “fight all the way to the end” to get the best Oklahoma that can be provided. 
Republican Kevin Norwood, a pastor, represents House District 74. Norwood was elected to replace former Rep. Mark Vancuren, R-Owasso, who resigned to serve as Tulsa County Deputy Commissioner.
“I feel encouraged today for the state of Oklahoma,” Norwood said. “I feel encouraged by the people I’ve met on this journey, the words of wisdom, the words of insight. I do appreciate those, and I look forward to our upcoming year and our upcoming session.”
Democrat Amanda Clinton, a small business owner, was elected to serve House District 71. Clinton replaced former Rep. Amanda Swope, D-Tulsa, who is serving as the city of Tulsa’s Director of Tribal Policy & Partnerships.
“I look forward to making a difference in this building with all of you,” Clinton said.
Oklahoma Supreme Court Chief Justice Dustin Rowe administered the oath of office. 
The House of Representatives has 81 Republicans and 20 Democrats.
“It is great to have our full 101 House members seated, ready to do the people’s business throughout the interim and into the 2026 legislative session,” said House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
These anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced in 2025 Idaho legislative session. Where does each stand?

The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
 Politicians, advocacy groups respond to SCOTUS ruling

The Tennessee House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Tennessee Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
 Roberts: Tennessee law doesn’t violate equal protection clause of 14th Amendment

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
Federal court rejects longer block on Idaho’s transgender bathroom restriction law

The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have health care options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota utility regulators on Wednesday denied a request to reconsider a vote on a controversial power line but explained that opponents still have time to weigh in before a final decision is made. 
The Public Service Commission in November approved a certificate of need for a large power line between Jamestown and Ellendale, known as the JETx project. However, the project still needs a route permit from the agency. 
A permit application for the approximately 95-mile, 345-kilovolt transmission line has not yet been submitted. Otter Tail Power and Montana-Dakota Utilities are partnering on the project. 
A petition to reconsider the November vote was filed in May, outside the timeframe specified in state law for such an appeal. 
Commission Chair Randy Christmann voted against the project in November but joined the other two commissioners in voting to reject the petition Wednesday.
“Although it was not the decision I wanted, the commission made a decision, and now we need to stick by it,” Christmann said. 
Commissioner Sheri Haugen-Hoffart said when an application is received, opponents can intervene in the case and state their concerns. There also will be a public hearing on the project.
The power line was part of a debate during the North Dakota legislative session this year. The Legislature approved a bill that says electrical transmission line projects must follow state zoning rules, taking away local government authority.
In another vote, the PSC approved the large Flickertail Solar Project in Richland County in southeast North Dakota. Construction on the $375 million project is expected to start next year. 
Otter Tail Power is a partner on the project.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Lawmakers declared “the power is on in South Carolina” as Gov. Henry McMaster ceremoniously signed a law aimed at meeting the growing state’s future energy needs.
Legislators and utility executives gathered in front of the Governor’s Mansion on Wednesday to celebrate passage of the law granting permission for Dominion Energy and state-owned utility Santee Cooper to partner on a proposed 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant along the Edisto River in Colleton County.
The massive piece of legislation — which McMaster actually signed into law last month — also included measures meant to speed up the permitting process for power plants and pipelines, which at times have dragged out in the court system for years.
It also makes it easier for utilities to raise power bills on an annual basis, a request that power executives said would result in smaller, though more frequent, increases that customers can adjust to more easily.
Sen. Tom Davis, who was heavily involved in the state’s power-related debate, also highlighted what he saw as environmental wins.
The Beaufort Republican pointed to a measure that empowers utility regulators to demand more from public utility companies when it comes to energy-efficient home programs. The bill also doubled down on previous requirements that utilities seek out the lowest-cost option when it comes to solar power and batteries for storing it.
Nuclear reboot?
But the energy effort that garnered the most praise from politicians Wednesday — the potential reboot of a pair of partially built nuclear reactors in the state — isn’t actually included in the law they were there to celebrate.
“South Carolina is in the lead in the country for a renaissance of nuclear power,” McMaster declared outside the Governor’s Mansion.
Santee Cooper is still sorting through a pool of potential buyers for the two units, located at the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station, that were mothballed almost eight years ago as part of a failed nuclear power expansion project. The Legislature encouraged the effort in a resolution signed by the governor last month.
“I am hopeful that something, which in 2017 became something of shame and embarrassment, is going to turn out to be something of opportunity for all South Carolinians,” Davis said.

Nearly 80 interested parties responded to Santee Cooper’s callout issued in January, more than 50 of which ultimately submitted a bid, said CEO Jimmy Stanton. Those involved include large utility companies, investment banks and technology giants.
“We’ve seen some very attractive proposals,” Stanton told the SC Daily Gazette.
Now, those applicants are partnering off and submitting more detailed, joint bids in a second round of vetting that Stanton said will last through the summer.
“No one entity is going to be able to do this,” Stanton said.
The project will need buyers for the power the plant produces, companies that can design, engineer and build it, and those that bring the financial wherewithal.
“We just want someone that we believe can finish the project,” Stanton said. “Show us that you can capitalize it. Show us you can build it.”
If a deal does get done, Santee Cooper customers still shouldn’t expect to see the cost of the plant come off their power bills, Stanton said. Instead, they’ll benefit from the electrons produced by a finished facility.
“For my customers, right now, they’re paying for something that isn’t generating electricity,” Stanton said. “If I can leverage what they are paying into something that generates electricity for them, that’s a win, win.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_3274-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-06-18 16:06:34.623713

The agency also manages more than 300 ports of entry at borders, airports and seaports. During his Senate confirmation hearing in April, the Senate Finance Committee’s top Democrat, Oregon Sen.

“This case was never about the merits of any particular transaction, but about ensuring government remains open and transparent for all Idahoans,” Labrador said Wednesday. “The (open meeting) law reflects the principle that government accountability depends on public access to decision-making processes, particularly for transactions of significant scope and financial impact.”
The State Board declined comment on the dismissal.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Open meetings lawsuit and bid for University of Phoenix have been intertwined since 2023

The open meetings lawsuit — and the U of I’s aborted Phoenix bid — have been intertwined since June 2023, in a series of twists and turns.
The lawsuit started in Ada County District Court, with a decisive ruling in the State Board’s favor. In January 2024, District Judge Jason Scott threw out Labrador’s lawsuit and said the State Board’s closed meetings were permitted under the law. State Board members “reasonably believed” the U of I was in competition with other Phoenix suitors, Scott ruled, and this justified the closed meetings.
Labrador prevailed on appeal. In December, the state Supreme Court said the lower court had “erred in several ways,” and kicked the case backed to Scott’s court. The Supreme Court did not determine whether the State Board had broken open meetings law: Instead, the court ordered Scott to revisit his earlier ruling.
Until Wednesday, the case was still on Scott’s docket. A “status conference,” a discussion between the two legal teams, had been scheduled for next week.
While the protracted lawsuit focused on open meetings law, it had a tangible impact on the U of I’s bid for Phoenix, a for-profit university serving more than 80,000 students nationally.
With the purchase mired in court, the U of I was unable to line up financing. This essentially stopped the transaction in its tracks.
The legal questions also resonated with legislators, who had felt blindsided by the State Board and the U of I. The 2024 Legislature pushed back against the purchase, forcing the U of I and Phoenix to start over. The State Board gave the universities another year ­ — an extension to allow them to bring a new plan to lawmakers — but nothing materialized.
In early June, with another State Board deadline looming, the U of I and Phoenix agreed to break off all talks. This joint decision closed the books on a purchase, but not the lawsuit.
With the dismissal, the two sides have agreed to cover their own legal bills. In March 2024, Scott had ordered Labrador’s office to pay more than $240,000 in State Board legal fees — but the Supreme Court’s subsequent ruling left the issue of legal fees in question.
Both parties have agreed to cover their costs, according to a court filing Wednesday.

While on her way home from a coworking space in Denver last year, Colorado state Rep. Jenny Willford says she was sexually assaulted by her Lyft driver.
In her lawsuit filed against Lyft in January, Willford alleges she was “subjected to unwelcome, nonconsensual sexual contact, touching” and lewd comments during the ride.
Willford was picked up by a different driver than the person identified in the Lyft app, according to the suit.
Her experience — and those that other survivors shared with her after hearing her story — prompted Willford, a Democrat, to introduce legislation this year that aimed to require safety measures for both riders and drivers using ridesharing apps.
“In my mind, all of these things are very basic when it comes to safety,” Willford said. “They’re just so common sense that it’s been really disheartening and frustrating to me that Uber … threatened to leave the state if the bill becomes law.”

Her bill would have required rideshare companies to conduct more regular background checks for drivers, to create a program for passengers or drivers who want to audio or video record their rides and to develop other safety policies.
But following Uber’s threats to leave the state if the measure passed, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it in late May. The bill would jeopardize rideshare services in Colorado “to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers,” his veto letter said.
Colorado isn’t alone. State and city leaders across the country are looking for ways to make rideshares safer. But lobbying campaigns from Uber and Lyft in many cases are blocking legislation meant to strengthen protections for both drivers and passengers.

Uber and Lyft, the two companies that dominate the U.S. rideshare industry, argue they have sufficient safety features within their apps.
“At Uber, we put safety at the heart of our operations, using technology, transparency, and accountability to help protect riders, drivers, and the broader community, with robust background checks and safety features like Audio and Video Recording, the Emergency Button, PIN verification, and RideCheck,” Uber wrote in a statement to Stateline.
“We remain committed to this work, and to dialogue with bill sponsors on sensible policies that keep people safe while protecting privacy and access.”
But there’s still a gap in regulations for rideshare companies because of their evolving technologies, said Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy, a left-leaning anti-poverty advocacy organization.
“Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers —that sort of work is relatively new, so there’s not a clear standard,” Roque said.
Uber and Lyft are employing lobbyists at the state and local levels. In Rhode Island, another state where legislators are pushing rideshare safety bills that the companies have objected to, Uber is on pace to spend $50,000 this year on lobbyists, according to the state’s lobbying database. Lyft has been spending $5,000 monthly on lobbyists in Rhode Island.

Across the country, Uber and Lyft have testified against measures in state legislative hearings and city council meetings. In Colorado’s case, a number of officials representing Uber spoke out against Willford’s legislation at committee hearings, while Lyft sent a letter to Gov. Polis urging him to veto it. Jerry Golden, Lyft’s chief policy officer, wrote in the letter that the legislation’s requirements “ignore and ultimately will not improve conditions for riders and drivers.”
Uber told the state Senate it would be “impossible” for rideshare companies to comply with the bill’s requirements immediately upon approval and that the  audio and video requirement is “not possible to enforce.”
“The intention of my legislation was never to drive out Uber or Lyft,” Willford said. “The intention was always to require a higher level of accountability and safety from them. But we can’t do that if they’re going to throw tantrums and pick up their toys and go home every time somebody asks them to do better.”
 Safety for passengers

As a part of Lyft’s safety measures, drivers must complete annual background checks and mandatory driver safety education. The app is also programmed to check in with riders when drivers take long stops or deviate from the route they were assigned.
Uber conducts periodic criminal screenings for all active drivers and requires drivers to regularly verify their identity by sharing a selfie with Uber using the app. Both companies offer live emergency assistance to riders.
Between 2020 and 2022, Lyft reported 23 fatal physical assaults of people using the Lyft platform and 2,651 instances of the five most serious categories of sexual assault, according to its 2024 Safety Transparency Report. While incidents of sexual assault had decreased 21% since the last report, which covered 2017-2019, fatal physical assaults jumped by 185%.
Uber saw 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022 and 2,717 incidents of the most serious categories of sexual assault, according to the company’s most recent safety report. Despite a 22% decline in sexual assault and misconduct, there was an increase in fatal physical assaults since its 2019-2020 report.
State lawmakers in several states have tried to address rideshare safety concerns with varying degrees of success.
Pending legislation in New Jersey and Massachusetts aims to prevent sexual assault and misconduct against passengers.
The New Jersey measure would require rideshare companies to share information concerning sexual misconduct investigations into a driver and would allow companies to ban drivers during an investigation. It remains in committee.
The bill in Massachusetts, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Rausch, would create a specific criminal penalty for the sexual assault of a passenger by a rideshare driver. The bill also would deem any rideshare passenger incapable of consenting to any sexual contact during a ride.  A hearing on the bill took place yesterday.
“We need to be able to make sure that people are safe and that people can trust those kinds of spaces to be safe,” Rausch said.

In May, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation that creates criminal penalties for impersonating a rideshare driver. Starting July 1, the crime counts as a second-degree misdemeanor. Uber supported the legislation.
But in Rhode Island, Lyft is pushing against legislation that would require fingerprinting as part of criminal background check. Brendan Joyce, the Lyft public policy manager, testified against the measure in April, saying the fingerprinting requirement relies on the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information System, which Joyce said has incomplete data. He also asserted that fingerprint checks “disproportionately impact and have potential discriminatory effects on communities of color.” Uber also testified against the proposal.
Rhode Island legislators introduced another measure that would prevent people under the age of 16 from using a rideshare service alone. Both bills are being held for further study.
 Driver protections

JC Muhammad, 57, has been a rideshare driver in and around Chicago since about 2016.
Now, he works full-time as an organizer for faith-based organizations and groups that support rideshare drivers, including The People’s Union, a membership-driven organization aimed at supporting workers in the city.
Muhammad was attacked by a passenger during a Lyft ride in 2022, he said. The passenger asked to borrow Muhammad’s phone and opened its Cash App. The passenger also hit him over the head twice, he said, and threw a brick at his car, denting the side.
“I was angry as hell,” Muhammad said. “I really wanted to engage the kid, but I said, ‘No, let me get back in my car.’”

After sharing the incident with Lyft, the company responded by saying it would not match him with that passenger again. But the person who rode with Muhammad did not match the profile of the person who originally requested the ride, he said.
Muhammad also said he couldn’t go to the police because he did not know the identity of the person who was in his car — and Lyft would not share the identity of the account holder who ordered the Lyft.
Uber and Lyft customers have the option to verify their account, but not everyone does, Muhammad said.
“That gives us some measure of comfort, but it really doesn’t do enough, especially when it comes to calling rides for other people,” Muhammad said. “The account holder may not be the actual passenger.”
Rideshare drivers across the country — especially those of color — are frequently harassed, according to a 2023 report from the Strategic Organizing Center. The center is a coalition of labor unions representing more than 2.5 million workers across the country.
The survey of over 900 app-based rideshare drivers found the majority had been verbally abused and more than a quarter of respondents were threatened with physical harm. Nearly 15% of the drivers were grabbed, groped or hit, according to the report.
There have been several incidents in Chicago where drivers are lured by a false account to a location where they are then robbed or attacked, said Deana Rutherford, the communications manager at the Chicago Gig Alliance, a subset of The People’s Lobby.
“These drivers just show up and they have no idea who’s about to get into their car,” Rutherford said. “And Uber doesn’t know who they are either.”
To address some of the safety and labor issues drivers were facing, the Chicago City Council began considering an ordinance backed by The People’s Lobby that would require passenger verification.
If passed, the ordinance would have also set a minimum wage for drivers, require companies to be more transparent about fares, have them disclose the details of driver account deactivations and more. Both Uber and Lyft initially opposed the ordinance. Uber warned the measure’s sponsor that the changes in pay rates would drive up costs for customers and force the company to cut 10,000 drivers, according to a letter Uber sent to a city alderman that was obtained by Stateline.
But Uber this week agreed to a deal that scraps Chicago’s ordinance in exchange for the company’s support for state legislation that would allow rideshare drivers to unionize, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

Those who did not visit the reported exposure sites during this time frame have no risk of exposure, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said.
The Edmond businesses include: 

Eileen’s Cookies on North Santa Fe Avenue,
Walmart Supercenter on West Danforth Road,
UPS Store on West Danforth Road, 
Goodwill on West Danforth Road, and 
Tropical Café on West Danforth Road. 

The agency urged people who have been exposed to measles or are experiencing symptoms to report this to the department and exclude themselves from public settings. Other exposures were recently reported at the Oklahoma City airport and a Walmart in Guymon. 
Those who have been exposed and are not immune from vaccinations or previous infections should isolate for 21 days from the date of exposure, according to the Health Department’s website. 
Oklahoma has reported 20 measles this year, as of Wednesday, including 17 cases confirmed by a test and three probable cases with a symptomatic patient. 
Of the cases, 17 were in unvaccinated people and two had an unknown vaccination status. One person had received two doses of the measles vaccine.
Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are 97% effective against measles and 86% effective against mumps, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

James Robert Peterson’s prior convictions prevented him from having guns. But the 38-year-old Prosperity man was carrying a shotgun when law enforcement officers attempted to arrest him at his mother’s home June 11, 2024, on burglary charges. He fatally shot Coba, a K-9 with the State Law Enforcement Division, who was between Peterson and three officers in the doorway, according to prosecutors.

Peterson pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. Judge Jacquelyn Austin sentenced him to 150 months in federal prison, the state’s U.S. Attorney’s Office announced Wednesday.
There is no parole in the federal system.
That’s in addition to his 33-year sentence in March on state charges of first-degree burglary, attempted murder, cruelty to a police dog and resisting arrest with a deadly weapon.
David Stumbo, the solicitor who prosecuted the state case in Newberry County, told legislators in April that only five of those 33 years were for killing Coba, one of five police dogs killed in duty last year.
“We didn’t believe that five years was nearly enough time,” Stumbo told senators.
In addition to Stumbo, sheriffs from Greenville and Richland County also testified in support of a bill that would increase the prison time and fines for anyone killing or injuring a police dog or horse in the state.
The existing penalty is up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. The proposal authored by Goose Creek Republican Brian Adams would increase penalties to $20,000 and a decade in prison.
The proposal advanced from the Senate Judiciary Committee and remains in play for next year’s session.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SLED-K9-Coba-1-1024x722.jpg,,,2025-06-18 15:06:28.615529

Rhode Island’s antiquated campaign finance software system is poised for a refresh under a $140,000, one-year contract approved by the Board of Elections Tuesday.
The panel’s unanimous vote sets in motion the long-awaited upgrade to the electronic system used to report and share information about campaign donations and spending.  
Elections board prepares to revamp R.I.’s aging campaign finance software. It just needs the money.

Rhode Island’s campaign finance software hasn’t been updated since its 2002 debut. The need to bring it into the modern era was never in dispute: The outdated system can’t accommodate certain, state-mandated reports including disclosure of independent expenditures and donations by political action committees and affidavits from vendors awarded high-dollar state contracts. And, it risks major disruptions when problems arise — most of the software engineers who designed the legacy system have retired, or are approaching retirement age.
But the extra money needed to pay for the refresh proved a problem, initially. The Rhode Island Board of Elections asked for an extra $250,000 in its fiscal 2026 budget request for software upgrades. Gov. Dan McKee did not include any of that money in his budget proposal.
But an unexpected $500,000 surplus in the elections agency’s current year budget solved the funding problem. The revised fiscal 2026 budget approved by the Rhode Island House Tuesday repurposes the fiscal 2025 surplus to the upcoming year, designating the money for the campaign finance software upgrade and new electronic poll books.
Pending approval by the state Department of Administration and Division of Purchasing, Florida-based software vendor Civix will begin the technical side of the software upgrade in July, with plans to start training candidates and campaign committees in January, Miguel Nunez, elections board director, said during the meeting. The proposed timeline ensures the upgraded software will be ready to use for the 2026 election cycle.
Once the switch to the new system occurs, historic data, from 2002 to 2022, will be archived as PDFs, available on the elections board website for download as searchable CSV files, Ric Thornton, campaign finance director told the board Tuesday.
“It’s a very robust feature that will provide both internal users at the agency and the public with the information they’re seeking on a historical basis,” Thornton said.
Some technology experts were critical of the board’s decision not to incorporate all of its existing campaign finance information into the new system. But Thornton told the board on Tuesday that transferring 23 years of data would cost $300,000 more, and take an extra six months — risking inability to complete the transition and candidate training for the 2026 election cycle.
A copy of the contract was not immediately available.
A previous work order submitted to the board by Civix projects the cost for software upgrades and ongoing maintenance to be $815,000 over the next five years. By comparison, it would cost $377,000 over the next five years to maintain the existing system.

Tammy Baldwin speaks on the Senate floor on Jan. 6, 2022 | Screenshot of video provided by Baldwin's office Wisconsin ExaminerU.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said she’ll “fight tooth and nail” to protect LGBTQ children after the administration of President Donald Trump proposed Wednesday that the national suicide and crisis lifeline would no longer support programs aimed at LGBTQ youth. 
On Wednesday, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) proposed defunding the program within the 988 suicide hotline aimed at LGBTQ children and cutting ties with the Trevor Project, a non-profit LGBTQ mental health organization. 
While the 988 number would still be available, LGBTQ children would no longer be able to request that they be directed to someone specifically trained in the area and with shared experiences. 
A survey conducted last year by the Trevor Project found that 40% of LGBTQ young people considered attempting suicide in the previous year and 12% of LGBTQ young people attempted suicide — both rates are higher than those among non-LGBTQ youth. 
Baldwin wrote the legislation to create the 988 hotline and worked to create an LGBTQ youth pilot program, which was expanded by Congress in 2023. 
Since the hotline’s creation, it has received 1.3 million contacts from LGBTQ people, according to SAMHSA data. 
“I worked hard to stand up a special line for LGBTQ+ youth because we are losing too many of our kids to suicide, and it’s well past time we did something about it,” Baldwin said. “Children facing dark times and even contemplating taking their life often have nowhere else to turn besides this 988 Lifeline, and the Trump Administration is cruelly and needlessly taking that away.” 
The proposal to cut funds for the LGBTQ program comes as the Trump administration has become increasingly hostile to LGBTQ people and as, on Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law that prohibits transgender children from receiving gender-affirming treatments. Republicans in Wisconsin and across the country have passed or attempted to pass laws preventing transgender children from participating in sports.
“During Pride Month, a time to celebrate the progress we’ve made, the Trump Administration is taking us a step back and telling LGBTQ+ kids that they don’t matter and don’t deserve help when they are in crisis,” Baldwin said. “This is not the final chapter of this story, and I’ll fight tooth and nail to protect these children. Suicide prevention has been and should continue to be a nonpartisan issue, and I call on my Republican colleagues who have long supported this program to fight for these kids, too. The children and teens who rely on 988 need our help, and it’s our duty to protect this literal lifeline for hundreds of thousands before it’s too late.”

The state Early Childhood Education and Care Department last week launched its statewide Summer Food Service Program, which offers free, nutritious meals to children while on break from school and to adults who are enrolled in school programs for people with disabilities.
Through August, more than 500 meal sites are providing food on a first-come, first-served basis. Sites and hours can be found on this map, or by calling 1-800-EAT-COOL (1-800-328-2665).
In a statement, department Secretary Elizabeth Groginsky invited every New Mexico family to take advantage of the program.
“Nutritious meals are essential for children to thrive, and no child should go without food just because school is out,” Groginsky said. “This program is one simple, effective way families can support their children’s health this summer — in a fun and social environment too.” 
The agency said in a news release it expects to serve approximately 17,000 children and 750,000 meals this summer. Last year, it served 16,565 children and 720,603 meals, according to the release.
Hundreds of thousands of New Mexicans, including one in four children, are food insecure, according to data from 2022 compiled by the nonprofit food bank network Feeding America. Counties with the highest rates of food insecurity include McKinley, Luna, Sierra, Socorro and Catron.
The state Public Education Department also runs an alternative summer food program called the Seamless Summer Option, whose meal sites are also shown on the map linked above. PED also oversees SUN Bucks, for which some families are automatically eligible to receive $120 in food benefits per child.
Starting next month, some Summer Food Service Program meal sites will make food using locally grown ingredients under a pilot based on the department’s New Mexico Grown grant program.
These programs are funded by the country’s major federal food assistance program called Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. A proposal going through the U.S. Congress could result in states shouldering some SNAP costs starting in 2028.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Farm Bureau’s latest food and farm index found that among concerns of the high cost of groceries, the overwhelming majority of Iowa grocery shoppers surveyed are concerned about increases to food prices caused by government regulations. 
The annual survey, conducted by the Harris Poll, also found that more consumers are seeking locally grown and produced products. 
“At a time when trust in national institutions—from government to media—is at historic lows, the sustained confidence in local farmers speaks volumes about their authenticity and transparency, underscoring the strong bond and mutual respect between Iowa’s farmers and the communities they serve,” said Latoya Guishard Welch, vice president of research for public release at the Harris Poll.

According to the food and farm index, 80% of shoppers are concerned, and 47% are very concerned, about government regulations that increase consumer food prices. The percentage of folks very concerned has more than doubled since 2021, when just 21% were more than just concerned about the role of government in increased food costs. 
U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics show direct imports, or finished products ready for sale, accounted for 15% of U.S. spending on food and beverages. Foreign ingredients and supplies comprised 4% of domestic food production. 
Forbes reported tariffs could have a significant impact on the cost of food and beverages at the grocery store, if imposed at their highest proposed levels.  
Study: Iowa importers paid 300% more in tariffs
A recent study from Farmers for Free Trade, a non-profit advocacy group, found that tariff costs for Iowa importers increased by $68 million, or 304% from April 2024 to April 2025. According to the Iowa “tarifflation” report, 90% of this increase came from tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, as opposed to legislative tariffs.
These tariffs primarily impacted imported unwrought aluminum, machinery parts, insecticides and fungicides, and engines. According to the study, imports from China had the highest tariffs, but imports from Mexico, Canada and South Korea faced dramatic increases in tariffs. 
Goods imported from Mexico to Iowa in April 2024 had tariffs of 0.2%, compared to a 4.4% tariff in April 2025. 
Reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China, which are currently on a 90-day reduction agreement, would put Iowa industries at a “significant” risk. In particular, Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports would hurt Iowa pork and soybean producers especially hard.
The Farmers for Free Trade study concluded the presidential tariffs, if they took effect and stayed in place, would “have major consequences” on Iowa. 
“Already, Iowa companies are paying tens of millions of dollars per day – money that could be better spent investing in companies and workers or lowering prices for their customers.” 
Consumers look at price first, but also value local goods
Recent consumer price index data from U.S. Department of Agriculture shows a 23.6% increase in grocery prices from 2020 to 2024, which likely explains why price continues to be the most important factor for Iowa grocery shoppers when making decisions on which types of food to buy. 
Three-fourths of Iowans said meat, poultry or dairy products are part of their daily diets, and a higher proportion of Iowans say they prefer “real” meat and dairy over plant-based alternatives. 
More and more, consumers are choosing to purchase these items directly from the farm. Sixty-nine percent said they have purchased groceries directly from farmers, through their online websites, farm stores or at farmers markets, and 40% of Iowa consumers look for locally made or grown labels when buying at the store. This is an increase from 2024 survey results which found around 30% of consumers sought local labels.
Iowa Farm Bureau President Brent Johnson said these statistics mean a lot to farmers. 
“Iowans are definitely paying attention to food prices, but they’re also looking for food that makes them feel connected to local farmers,” Johnson said. “We take pride in growing safe, high-quality food for our neighbors and knowing they trust us to do that really hits home.” 
The survey results also show that more than 90% of shoppers said they trust farmers and 49% said they place a “great deal of trust” in Iowa farmers in general. The survey also asked consumers if they felt confident farmers were caring for animals and the environment, which the vast majority, around 80% for each category, did.
Johnson said flexibility in farming is “crucial” for farmers to provide a variety of consumer options. Consumers agree, with 86% responding that farmers should have the flexibility to explore different farming techniques. 
“Year after year, farmers and consumers have been feeling the pinch of high costs and that is only exacerbated when individual states enact restrictions on production practices that ultimately impact prices at the grocery store,” Johnson said.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Leaders in the Louisiana Legislature are advising members to be hyperaware in the wake of what’s been labeled a political assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband last weekend. 
Democratic Rep. Melissa Hortman, Minnesota House speaker emeritus, and her husband, Doug, were killed at their home overnight Friday. Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot multiple times and seriously wounded earlier in the evening. The suspect, Vance Boelter, had written manifestos in which he listed other political figures he had marked for death, according to police.
Louisiana Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, told our news partners at WVUE-TV Fox 8 he has been in touch with State Police and Capitol security after the attacks in Minnesota.  
“All members take threats seriously whether it’s through email, text message, social media – all those threats are taken seriously by members,” Henry said. “The incidents in Minnesota just furthered the need for members to stay vigilant; all elected officials stay vigilant about their surroundings and report all text messages, emails, anything threatening no matter the source.”
Louisiana House Speaker Phillip DeVillier has also reached out to members about safety precautions, said Meg Casper Sunstrom, the legislature’s chief communications officer. 
Security measures have been heightened at the State Capitol in recent years. The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol inspired the creation of a new police force for the State Capitol and Pentagon Apartments, where many legislators stay during the lawmaking sessions and some weekends. Lawmakers have hired a police chief for the new department, but its staffing has not been fleshed out yet.
Just ahead of this year’s legislative session, new security screening technology was installed at the entrances to the State Capitol.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Ryan Melton, a Democratic candidate for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District who ran in 2022 and 2024, has suspended his campaign due to personal matters, including his job and family.
Melton announced the suspension on social media Tuesday, saying it was one of the “toughest decisions” he’s ever made.
“It was an honor to fight the good fight on your behalf, and I will continue to, just in different ways,” Melton said in his post. “It’s the biggest sacrifice I’ve ever made for the greater good, but I don’t regret a single minute, and am proud of the fact that the party out here in the 4th is in a much better place now than it was when I first began running.”

Reasons he gave for stepping out of the race included recently losing his job at Nationwide Insurance due to company reorganization and the need to find a new job to support his family, as well as dealing with a health concern. He added he wants to stay home for his wife and 6-year-old son.
Incumbent U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who won elections against Melton for the district in 2022 and 2024, has launched an exploratory committee for a possible gubernatorial run in Iowa. Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, has made a similar move for the 4th Congressional District. The district spans much of northwest Iowa and includes Ames, Council Bluffs and Sioux City.
Between his two campaigns, Melton said in his post his vote shares across the district’s 36 counties either stayed steady or grew, a fact he is proud of achieving as someone with a full-time job, family and no funding from political action committees representing corporate interests.
Melton said in his post he’s been happy to hear from first-time political candidates from across the state who have reached out, and said he’ll be rooting for them. He also encouraged everyday people to run for office, even if they don’t know how everything works or don’t have the funds or industry support to get their name out there right away.
“We need more working people that struggle every day along with most Americans to run for every office, and I’ll always make time for you if you want to call me to inquire,” Melton said in his post. “Also, even if you are in a district that may seem unwinnable on Election Day, run anyway, because if you tell the truth and run as a sacrifice for the greater good, you’ll find so many wins out there.”
Travis Terrell, a Democrat running in Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, said in a social media post Melton was one of the first people he called — and one of the few who responded — when launching his campaign. Melton made “an extremely powerful point” in his announcement that more working people need to get out and run for office.
“We need working class voices to fight, let’s be honest, the rich and powerful are not going to save us when they’re the one’s holding us down,” Terrell said in his post. “It takes real people to power real change. Thank you Ryan.”

[…]","Lambeau Field in Green Bay | Photo by Jason Kerzinski for Wisconsin ExaminerGov. Tony Evers announced Wednesday that he’s awarding $1.8 million to the city of Green Bay to cover the public safety costs associated with hosting the NFL draft in April. 
The event drew more than 600,000 visitors to the city which, with a population of about 105,000, is the smallest NFL city in the country. Initial estimates say the draft generated $94 million in economic activity across the state and $20 million for the Green Bay area specifically. 
Prior to the draft, a pair of Republican lawmakers had requested that the Republicans in control of the budget writing Joint Finance Committee include $1.25 million in the next state budget to help cover public safety costs. That request has not yet been addressed as Republicans continue to work on delivering a state budget to Evers. 
The money Evers awarded is being disbursed from the Opportunity Attraction and Promotion Fund, a program proposed by Evers in his last state budget proposal to help the state recruit and host large-scale events. The 2023-25 budget included $10 million for the program and Evers had proposed an additional $5 million in his latest budget proposal. 
“The 2025 NFL Draft was a booming success, and I’ve said all along that nobody could have pulled it off other than the Green Bay Packers and the good folks in Green Bay and across the region,” Evers said in a statement. “So, it was critically important to me that Green Bay and our local partners received the support they need to cover public safety costs, and I’m glad we were able to get this done.” 
According to a news release, the grant will also help the village of Ashwaubenon and Brown County cover their costs associated with the event. Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich said the money will keep the burden of the event off city taxpayers. 
“We’re incredibly grateful to Gov. Evers and WEDC for their critical support in covering public safety expenses related to the NFL Draft,” Genrich said. “This was a historic event that brought enormous economic benefits to our community and the entire state of Wisconsin. The allocation of this funding recognizes that positive statewide economic effect and protects our local taxpayers from bearing the costs—a win-win for our state’s and our city’s residents.”

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States vs. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
 

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The Tennessee House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond successfully defended a similar Oklahoma law.
“This case is a tremendous victory for Oklahoma’s children, ensuring they will not be subjected to the consequences of these life-altering surgeries,” Drummond said. “The practice is unconscionable, and I appreciate the court’s ruling that we as a state have the right to protect Oklahoma children from this irreparable harm.”

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)In his second tenure leading Indiana’s most expensive state agency, Family and Social Services Administration Secretary Mitch Roob wants to significantly change Indiana’s insurance program for low- to middle-income Hoosiers. But ongoing negotiations in Washington D.C. could undermine or fundamentally alter the third iteration of the Healthy Indiana Plan, otherwise known as HIP. 
Some congressional changes could be prohibitively expensive for the state, coming on the heels of a bleak revenue forecast projecting $2 billion less in Indiana’s coffers over the next two years.
“This is a five-alarm fire for us,” said Roob, who introduced the first version of HIP while he was the FSSA secretary under former Gov. Mitch Daniels. 
In a sit-down with the Indiana Capital Chronicle, Roob previewed a Wednesday presentation before the State Budget Committee introducing HIP 3.0, including work requirements, provider taxes and wellness incentives. But the final details can’t be determined until Congress agrees on President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which could be approved in the coming weeks. 
GOP senators warn mega-bill’s new Medicaid cuts will hurt rural hospitals

Work requirements for able-bodied adults on HIP were fiercely debated in the legislative session earlier this year, ultimately advancing with the support of the Republican supermajority. But the process would take months, requiring Indiana to submit a modified waiver for federal approval before it could be enacted. 
That timeline could be shortened under the latest version of the bill, which would force all states to adopt such regulations.
“Once the big, beautiful bill passes, we will move forward as quickly as we can with that,” Roob said about work requirements.
Other states have stumbled in their rollout of such conditions, including Arkansas and Georgia. Roob said details of Indiana’s plan would largely hinge on Congress’ actions and pointed to support from Indiana Gov. Mike Braun.
“He believes in work requirements; he doesn’t believe in work requirements to kick people off of the program,” said Roob. “He believes that Medicaid ought to be a program that incentivizes individuals to work — not disincentivizes them to do so.”
While Indiana’s work requirements would have allowed an exception for parents in general, Congress now proposes limiting that exemption to parents of children who aren’t teens. More than 712,000 Hoosiers rely on HIP for their health coverage, according to a May enrollment report.
 Ongoing discussions in Washington D.C.

Other portions of the bill threaten to undo Indiana’s program, particularly its cap on state provider taxes, according to Roob. The Senate has proposed a cap of 3.5% on the levy, which applies to hospitals and managed care entities. A higher tax means the state can leverage more federal dollars.
But Indiana uses the maximum allowed tax of 6% on hospitals, known as a hospital assessment fee, to fund its obligation for HIP. Those taxes — along with a portion of the cigarette tax — pay for the entire program, meaning that no general fund dollars need to be dedicated to HIP. 
“That’s how we pay for the Healthy Indiana Plan,” Roob said. “If (Congress’ proposal is) signed into law, this would require the state of Indiana to significantly roll back eligibility in the Healthy Indiana Plan.
“Not because we want to — because we have no match.”
  Pins urge people to “Protect Medicaid” at an April 1, 2025 rally. In particular, attendees opposed Senate Bill 2, which would impose work requirements on certain Medicaid enrollees. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Indiana is responsible for 10% of the costs while the federal government picks up the tab for the remainder. However, under its current waiver, Indiana could be on the hook if the hospital assessment fee is cut and would need to come up with the difference. Roob said he was working with Indiana’s congressional delegation to provide states explicit authority to change their plans in a later version of the bill. 
This rate cap would also apply to any provider tax levies on managed care entities, which oversee several of Indiana’s Medicaid programs, including services offered under the divisive PathWays for Aging waiver. Indiana submitted a plan to tax managed care entities earlier this month based on the plans of other states, such as Ohio and Illinois, which could net the state $865.8 million. 
But Congress could invalidate that proposal by prohibiting that type of tax, which isn’t uniform and varies by provider type, in favor of something more equal across the board. 
“It is not law yet, so we are racing to try to get this approved,” said Roob. “I view our prospects of getting this done as not quite as good as the Pacers winning the series.”
Portions of the proposal in Congress would require copays and premiums for certain Medicaid enrollees, something that was halted in Indiana by a federal judge last year. If allowed, Roob said the state would “likely” bring that back — though he said the state was seeking more “explicit authority” to implement cost-sharing requirements in the final version of the bill.
Undoubtedly, such a move would be challenged in the courts. 
But Roob said Hoosiers on HIP could reduce such charges by meeting certain wellness guidelines, such as preventative care check-ups. Women getting regular pap smears, for example, would lower their cost-sharing obligations.
“And while we recognize that that won’t save Indiana much money in that particular year, it may save that woman from having cervical cancer,” Roob said. “So it is the governor’s desire to ‘Make Indiana Healthy Again,’ and part of that is to incentivize changes in behavior.”

The chambers of the Maine Legislature are in disagreement over a roughly $320 million budget addition to the $11.3 billion biennial budget passed in March.
With some Democrats joining Republicans in opposition, the Maine House of Representatives failed to advance the plan Wednesday morning, while the Senate cast a party-line vote in favor. 
The initial conflicting votes come after the Democratic majority on the Legislature’s Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee set the budget proposal early Saturday morning without Republican support. 
While added appropriations in the plan total about $320 million, the bill has a lower fiscal note — $117 million —  due to a range of cost cutting measures — taxes, some cuts, and transferring unexpected surpluses. The net cost is also lower than the roughly $127 million that remained after the initial budget passed in March. 
The plan rejects some of Gov. Janet Mills’ proposed cuts, such as to childcare programs and low-income food assistance, as well as proposed taxes on ambulances and pharmacies. However, the plan includes Mills’ proposed tax additions on streaming services, cannabis, pensions and cigarettes — the latter at an even higher amount than the governor requested.
“Republicans had started from a position of no new taxes and we remain in that posture,” Republican budget lead Rep. Jack Ducharme of Madison said on the House floor.
On the Senate floor, Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) also criticized the majority party for not taking “a serious look back about our state’s financial disrepair,” nodding to the state budget audit he called for before session began.
Committee sets budget plan with party-line vote

But Republicans were not the only members of the House to have objections, as the budget bill failed 71-77 on the first vote before the chamber then voted against its passage without a roll call. Following the Senate’s vote 19-15 in favor, the bill now heads back to see if the House will change its stance. 
Through tears, Rep. Nina Milliken (D-Blue Hill), who voted against the budget, urged her colleagues to reject regressive taxes, which have a greater impact on people with lower incomes, and instead push for a model that taxes the wealthy more — even if the governor, who has opposed any income-based tax reform, ultimately vetoes it. 
“Democrats across this country right now are calling for Republican members of Congress to stand up to the executive branch, because they are a separate co-equal branch of government and they should be asserting their power as such,” Milliken said, referring to push back against President Donald Trump. 
“We are a separate co-equal branch of government,” she added. “We owe it to our constituents to do better, to tax people who are super wealthy, so that the poorest people in our communities see some relief.”
After both chambers narrowly rejected a “millionaire’s tax” in initial votes, the Senate reversed its stance Monday night, sending the measure back to the House to reconsider. The proposal would place a tax surcharge of 2% on the portion of a resident’s taxable income beyond $1 million for single filers to be used to fund public K-12 education.
As the Legislature continues to debate the budget bill Wednesday, lawmakers are expected to propose a number of floor amendments. One proposal, filed by Rep. Sally Cluchey (D-Bowdoinham), would tack on this “millionaire’s tax.”
The budget plan being considered also effectively stops the state’s free community college program for future graduating classes, against the governor’s request to make it permanent. Several bills currently pending were also worked into the budget plan, including proposals to alter the child tax credit and real estate transfer tax. Read about more of the details of the plan here. 
Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln), an appropriations committee member, said in a floor speech that the budget is as much about avoiding harm as it is about providing for Mainers, a sentiment both of the committee chairs also shared.
“This is not a flashy budget,” co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said. “It’s a workhorse — steady, thoughtful and grounded in real need.” 
Rotundo asked her colleagues to vote for the budget “not because it gives everyone everything they want” but because “it reflects who we are, a state that cares deeply, spends responsibly and plans wisely for the future.” 
Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook) made a similar plea in the House earlier Wednesday. 
“This budget meets the moment,” Gattine said. “It addresses the biggest issues that Maine people are facing, and protects critical investments that we’ve made in the past in health care, food security, education, housing and child care.”

Meanwhile, Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester), another member of the appropriations committee, argued the budget plan was built on a “house of cards,” pointing out that it was balanced, in part, by an unexpected $24 million estate tax after two recent deaths and that it doesn’t provide the full expected cost-of-living increase for direct care workers. 
Also, projections for the following biennium present an approximately $246 million increase based on the ongoing spending in the budget plan. 
Republicans have filed several floor amendments to the budget, including to increase MaineCare funding for veterans homes, hire more state troopers, remove the proposed increase to the cigarette tax and ensure timely payments to service providers. 
Arata and Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport), who is also on the committee, argued that the state’s budgetary needs for the next fiscal year have already been met.
“This is a tax and spend supplemental budget,” Fredette said. 
In March, the Democratic majority pushed through a two-year budget plan without Republican support and formally adjourned in order to start the clock for those funds to become available in 90 days, which will be on Friday. 
Senate Republicans refused to back an alternative short-term plan that would have immediately filled the current deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, because it did not include structural reform to the program.
That budget continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing one-time funding for MaineCare and other urgent needs. But it didn’t include any of the policy changes Mills proposed to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
Some Republican legislators tried to collect signatures to allow Maine voters to overturn the budget passed in March but failed to reach the needed threshold, the leader of the people’s veto effort, Rep. Gary Drinkwater of Milford, announced on Tuesday.

The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.

U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field.

Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s office last month told state agency directors to make internal plans for budget “holdbacks,” midyear cuts in spending. Little also placed limits on budget requests.
The two directives come as state revenue lags behind projections and major tax cuts take effect. 
Little’s Division of Financial Management on May 29 sent agency directors a memo outlining the governor’s expectations, as agencies prepare their budget requests ahead of next year’s legislative session. 
The division issues similar guidance memos around this time every year. But the state is facing “a different scenario than we have seen in the past several years,” Division of Financial Management administrator Lori Wolff wrote in the latest memo, which Idaho Education News obtained through a public records request. 
The Idaho Capital Sun reported last week that state tax revenue is $141.5 million below projections, while policymakers enacted $453 million in tax cuts this year. This means the state will have less revenue than projected in fiscal year 2027 and in future years, Wolff wrote in the memo. 
Wolff told agency directors that budgets relying on state general fund dollars will be limited to “maintenance” spending. Directors must get pre-approval from the governor’s office before making new spending requests that use federal or dedicated funds. She also told directors to “internally prepare” for 2%, 4% or 6% budget holdbacks “as we continue to watch economic trends at the national level.”
“Although we understand that there are still many initiatives and challenges that impact your agency and operations, we must submit a balanced budget,” Wolff wrote, “and Idaho’s current revenue projections only allow for slight growth in appropriations for FY 2027.”

 Idaho Department of Education, State Board and higher ed will have to identify spending cuts

It’s too early to say what the budget restrictions could mean for public education funding. But the Idaho Department of Education, State Board of Education and colleges and universities will have to identify spending cuts up to 6%. 
State revenue changes always impact education spending, whether tax collections are lower or higher than expected, state superintendent Debbie Critchfield said Monday. 
“We are in budget discussions now and examining all types of scenarios,” she said. 
In a statement to EdNews Tuesday, Wolff sought to ease concerns. The state is still seeing year-over-year revenue growth, “signaling a strong Idaho economy.” Lawmakers and Little left a $400 million cushion in the current year’s budget. They also put 22% of general fund revenues in rainy-day funds, Wolff said. 
“That said, as a responsible manager of taxpayer resources, Gov. Little is preparing for a number of scenarios as we get closer to the end of the fiscal year. While we continue to watch revenue closely, we feel good about the strength of the state budget and our economy.”

Budget schedule 
Agency directors must send the governor’s office their budget requests by Aug. 29.
These include spending requests for fiscal year 2027 as well as supplemental spending requests for fiscal year 2026.

Fiscal year 2026 runs from July 1 to June 30, 2026. The Legislature set these budgets during the 2025 session.
Fiscal year 2027 runs from July 1, 2026, to June 30, 2027. The Legislature will set these budgets during the 2026 session. 

Little’s office will consider agency requests in the months leading up to next year’s session, and the governor will present his budget recommendations to lawmakers in January. 

 Why is state revenue lagging? 

In her memo, Wolff noted two reasons for the “conservative” budget guidance: Lagging sales tax revenue and tax cuts.
In April, state tax revenue was $55 million short of the Legislature’s projection, and May revenues came in $98 million short, the Capital Sun reported last week. 
Altogether, state revenue was $141.5 million below the Legislature’s projections heading into June, the last month of the 2025 fiscal year. The current shortfall would leave $278.2 million on the state’s ending balance for fiscal year 2025, down from $420 million. 
Wolff told agency directors that Idaho is “seeing slower growth in sales tax revenue, so our revenue projections for future years have been adjusted downward. This will have a direct impact on budget planning for agencies (in the 2026 legislative) session.” 
She also noted that the Legislature and Little this year made tax cuts worth $453 million. While this “historic tax relief” will eventually result in economic growth, she wrote, it means the state will collect less revenue than projected.
Lawmakers passed and Little signed these tax relief bills:

House Bill 40 cut income taxes by $253 million by reducing the individual and corporate income tax rate from 5.695% to 5.3%, expanding exemptions for military pensions and eliminating capital gains taxes on gold bullion.
House Bill 93 created a $50 million refundable tax credit program covering private school and home-school expenses.
House Bill 231 increased the grocery tax credit to $155 per person, altogether providing $50 million in sales tax relief.
House Bill 304 added $100 million to property tax relief funds that benefit homeowners and help school districts pay down bonds and levies.

These cuts were more than three times what Little proposed at the start of this year’s legislative session — he proposed in $100 million and $50 million for private school choice. While Little raised concerns about the scale of tax relief pitched by the Legislature’s Republican leadership, he has since touted the tax cuts in post-session appearances.

 What does the budget guidance mean for public education? 

The governor’s office on Tuesday did not address the likelihood of holdbacks in the coming months. But Wolff said that “public education and teacher pay will remain the governor’s top priorities.” 
In her memo, Wolff wrote that planning for holdbacks “helps us be prepared for uncertainty” and “allows agencies to look internally at priorities and operations and ensure critical operations are prioritized.”
The Idaho Constitution directs the state government to maintain a balanced budget. And state law allows the governor to rescind spending authority if budgeted expenses exceed revenue in a given year.
Little last ordered budget holdbacks in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when he cut public school spending by 5%. Most of the cuts focused on discretionary and salary spending. Before that, former Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter ordered holdbacks in 2010, following the Great Recession.
Critchfield said local school leaders are “paying close attention” to state revenues this month as districts and charter schools set their 2025-26 budgets. Some districts are facing budget strains already this year, after lawmakers and the Education department required minimum salary increases. 
Looking ahead, schools’ operations costs and special education costs “won’t be going down,” Critchfield said, “so we are looking at ways to ease those pressures without new or ongoing dollars.”
The “maintenance” budget limitations essentially mean that agencies can only request funding for bills they have to pay — expenses that keep the lights on, satisfy contractual obligations and pay employees. 
The Division of Financial Management sent out estimates of what these budgets should look like for most agencies. Colleges and universities, for instance, are limited to $398.1 million, and the Office of the State Board of Education can request up to $47.3 million. The Idaho Department of Education is not included in the list of estimates. 
According to the memo, a maintenance budget includes: 

A 1% placeholder for state employee raises. 
An 18% increase in health insurance costs.
Inflationary adjustments that are contractually obligated. 
Replacement item costs, calculated using a three-year average. 
Non-discretionary changes to population forecast adjustments.

If an agency plans to ask for a line-item “enhancement” from federal or dedicated funding sources, the agency must meet with the governor’s office “to discuss its necessity for inclusion,” Wolff wrote. Additionally, supplemental spending requests for FY 26 should be “used as a tool of last resort.”
The Division of Financial Management will later assess whether revenue projections support state employee raises — including for K-12 teachers — Wolff wrote. “Agencies should not submit line-item requests for additional personnel funds outside of” change in employee compensation, the state’s employee raise structure.

Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)One more person has been confirmed to have died in flash flooding in Ohio County, West Virginia over the weekend, bringing the death toll to eight. One other person is still unaccounted for, Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Wednesday.  
The male victim’s name is being withheld until his family has been told, Morrisey said. Officials did not say where the body was located.
“This is a very challenging time for the residents of Ohio County,” the governor said during a briefing from Wheeling. 
Recovery efforts are underway in Ohio and Marion counties in northern West Virginia, where several inches of rain fell in a short time period Saturday and Sunday, causing flooding. 
The body of a 71-year-old woman was found at the Wetzel County dam earlier this week. A 3-year-old child and her mother were also among those who died in the flooding.
In Marion County, where a 28-unit apartment building in Fairmont collapsed during the flooding Sunday, there are no reports of death, Morrisey said Wednesday. 
Morrisey said he had spoken with White House officials and the Federal Emergency Management Agency about the flooding and the need for federal assistance. He encouraged affected residents to fill out a survey that will help the state tally how much damage the storms have caused. The surveys are very important to the state’s request for FEMA help, he said. 
“We’re going to proceed diligently the same way the state always has,” he said. “We’re going to go through the process. We’re working locally with people to make sure that those survey instruments are filled out and that they’re returned. That’s the key to success in situations like this. 
“We have to have people that are affected on the ground return that survey instrument in order to ensure that we are counting the numbers properly,” he said. 
Morrisey called for volunteers to help with cleanup efforts.
“I ask people in West Virginia and across the country if people want to come in and help, we need to get those homes cleared and mucked up,” Morrisey said. 
In Marion County, people can call the Tygart Valley United Way at 304-366-4550 if they’d like to volunteer. People who’d like to volunteer in Ohio County can call the Wheeling-Ohio Emergency Emergency Management Agency at 304-234-7109.

Delaware has been ranked the 10th best state in the country for pickleball players, according to a new national report by PodPlay Pickleball Business Guide.
The ranking is based on the number of pickleball venues per capita, with Delaware offering 3.52 facilities per 100,000 residents. The report analyzed the availability of indoor and outdoor pickleball courts across the U.S., identifying states and cities with the highest number of courts relative to population size. Vermont topped the list with nearly 11 venues per 100,000 residents, followed by Maine, Hawaii, South Dakota, and Idaho rounding out the top five.
Wilmington ranked as the fifth-best city in the country for pickleball access, with 13.97 courts per 100,000 residents. The city offers 10 venues with a combined total of 16 indoor and 29 outdoor courts, providing year-round options for local players.

“These findings reveal which areas have embraced the pickleball trend and how different regions adapt based on their weather patterns,” said Ben Borton, co-founder of PodPlay.  
Florida dominated the city-level rankings, with Sarasota, Bradenton, and Boynton Beach claiming the top three spots due to their abundance of outdoor courts and favorable climate. Wilmington was the highest-ranked city outside the Southeast to make the top five.
“Florida cities make the most of endless sunshine with plenty of outdoor courts, while northern states like Vermont and Maine ensure year-round play through a significant number of indoor courts,” said Borton. 
The report used data from Places2Play and the U.S. Census Bureau, considering cities with at least 10 venues. Rankings were based on the number of locations per 100,000 residents, as well as the balance of indoor and outdoor courts.
The results highlight growing national interest in pickleball and the expanding infrastructure supporting the sport across diverse regions.

Aug. 5, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The long-time sheriff of Nebraska’s second-most populous county announced Wednesday he will not seek a ninth term, endorsing his chief deputy to take his spot in the 2026 elections.
Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner, a Republican serving in one of the state’s “bluest” counties, announced he would step down after 32 years in the position in 2027. He was first elected in 1994 and ran unopposed for reelection until 2022, winning with 53% of the vote. He is the longest-serving sheriff in Lancaster County history. Wagner started as a dispatcher for the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office in 1976 at 22.

Wagner has endorsed Lancaster County Chief Deputy Ben Houchin, who has worked alongside Wagner since Houchin joined the Sheriff’s Office in 1993, shortly after graduating from college.
In a statement, Wagner said Houchin “has my full support.”
“I’ve seen firsthand his commitment and dedication to serve our county and put our residents’ safety first above all else,” Wagner said. “Chief Deputy Houchin will be a sheriff that listens and collaborates to address challenges our county faces.”
Houchin has spent 25 years as a team leader and commander in the Tactical Response Unit, rising to sergeant in 2000, captain in 2005 and as chief deputy in 2020. He participated in the 229th session of the FBI National Academy, where he graduated in 2007. 
The Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office describes Houchin as “instrumental” in establishing its Electronic Evidence Unit, Fugitive Task Force and Criminal Interdiction Task Force.

Wagner has stepped up marijuana enforcement in Lancaster County, including outside his office in 2020 when he sued to stop a statewide ballot measure related to medical cannabis, arguing that it was too broad to fit under the Nebraska Constitution’s “single-subject clause.” The Supreme Court agreed with Wagner, and it wasn’t until 2024 that supporters successfully got on the ballot. Both proposals passed with overwhelming public support.
This spring, Wagner was one of 50-plus sheriffs to join Attorney General Mike Hilgers in fighting a legislative bill to help clarify how the state should implement medical cannabis. The bill failed to advance.
Lancaster County leaders endorsing Houchin include: State Sens. Beau Ballard and Carolyn Bosn, Lancaster County Attorney Pat Condon, former Nebraska State Patrol Superintendent John Bolduc and former Lincoln Police Department Chiefs Jeff Bliemeister and Jim Peschong.

Hilgers, Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly (former Lancaster County attorney and U.S. attorney for Nebraska) and Sarpy County Sheriff Greg London also endorsed Houchin.
Houchin said he has been honored to work alongside Wagner to keep his home county safe.
“My top priorities are being responsive to public safety needs, collaborating with the public and other law enforcement agencies and listening to the community we serve,” Houchin said in a statement. “I look forward to working together to solve the toughest issues facing our county.”
Any candidates for sheriff will compete in partisan primaries in May 2026, and the top candidate for each will advance to November 2026. No Democrats or third-party candidates have yet announced.

The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”

Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

Free.,Judge grills Trump DOJ on order tying transportation funding to immigration enforcement,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-grills-trump-doj-order-tying-transportation-funding-immigration-enforcement,,"A Rhode Island federal judge seemed likely Wednesday to block the U.S. Department of Transportation’s move to yank billions in congressional funding for bridges, roads and airport projects if Democrat-led states do not partake in federal immigration enforcement.U.S. District Judge John James McConnell Jr.during a hearing pressed acting U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom on how the Transportation Department could have power over funding that was approved by Congress, saying federal agencies “only have appropriations power given by Congress.”“That's how the Constitution works,” he said. “Where does the secretary get the power and authority to impose immigration conditions on transportation funding?”The suit brought by 20 Democratic state attorneys general challenges an April directive from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, a former House member from Wisconsin, that requires states to cooperate in federal immigration enforcement in order to receive federal grants already approved by Congress.“Defendents seek to hold hostage tens of billions of dollars of critical transportation funding in order to force the plaintiff states to become mere arms of the federal government's immigration enforcement policies,” Delbert Tran of the California Department of Justice, who argued on behalf of the states, said.Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Bloom said that Duffy’s letter simply directs the states to follow federal immigration law.McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011, said that while the states could interpret it that way, the Trump administration has gone after so-called sanctuary cities and targeted them for not taking the same aggressive immigration enforcement as the administration.The judge said Bloom’s argument expressed a “very different” interpretation of the directive than how the administration has described it publicly. He also noted President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have “railed on … the issues that arise from sanctuary cities.”Trump this week directed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to target Chicago, Los Angeles and New York — three major Democrat-led cities that have policies to not aid in immigration enforcement.McConnell said he would make a decision whether to issue a preliminary injunction before Friday. The preliminary injunction would be tailored to the states that brought the suit and would not have a nationwide effect.The states that brought the suit are California, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.Undermines CongressTran said the Department of Transportation’s directive is not only arbitrary and capricious, but undermines congressional authority because Congress appropriated more than $100 billion for transportation projects to the states.Cutting off funding would have disastrous consequences, the states have argued.“More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States,” according to the brief from the states.Transportation security and immigrationBloom defended Duffy’s letter, saying it listed actions that would impede federal law enforcement and justified withholding of funds because “such actions compromise the safety and security of the transportation systems supported by DOT financial assistance.”McConnell said that didn’t answer his question about the secretary’s authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funding.“It seems to me that the secretary is saying that a failure to comply with immigration conditions is relevant to the safety and security of the transportation system,” Bloom said.McConnell seemed skeptical of that argument.“Under that rationale, does the secretary of the Department of Transportation have the authority to impose a condition on federal highway funds that prohibit a state that has legalized abortion from seeking a federal grant?” he asked. Bloom said that question was beyond her directive from the Department of Transportation to address in her arguments to the court.“I understand your question,” she said. “All I think I can say is that here the secretary has, in his statement, set out a rationale for why this is relevant to DOT funding.”Tran said that the “crux of this case is” that the Trump administration is trying “to enforce other laws that do not apply to these grants,” by requiring states to partake in immigration enforcement.“It's beyond their statutory authority,” he argued.",,,,2025-06-18 14:09:39.664426

Deandra Buchanan, convicted in Boone County of three counts of first-degree in 2002, was originally sentenced to death. The Missouri Supreme Court reduced the sentence to life without parole in 2003.
The statute allowing the court to directly resentence people sentenced to death violates another law, and federal court precedent, requiring defendants to be present when their sentence is pronounced, Buchanan argued through public defender Tyler Coyle.
When the Supreme Court found the death sentence to be unconstitutional in Buchanan’s case, the trial court should have brought him in for in-person resentencing.
But Boone County Circuit Judge Jeff Harris disagreed, deciding that the high court was within its authority when it changed Buchanan’s sentence. Harris didn’t address the constitutional questions raised by Buchanan.
“Because the Supreme Court exercised its authority to resentence defendant, there was no need and basis for the circuit court to take any further action or hold a resentencing hearing,” Harris wrote.
The ruling isn’t a setback, Coyle said, because he and Buchanan had expected a definitive ruling would come from an appeals court.
“The state argued at our in-person hearing that if we have a problem with what the Supreme Court did, we should be asking the Supreme Court,” Coyle said. “That’s what the prosecutor argued to Judge Harris. It kind of sounds like by not addressing that part of it, that’s what is left for us to do now.”
In his final brief in the case, Coyle wrote that the question is analogous to the issue decided by the Missouri Supreme Court in 2022 when defendants challenged the outcome of hearings held online with witnesses or defendants not physically present.
The hearing formats were intended to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.
In those cases, the court ruled unanimously that there are no “sick days” for constitutional rights.
“There’s a fundamental right to be present for all critical stages,” Coyle said. “The U.S. Supreme Court has said this, and the U.S. Supreme Court has also said that sentencing is a critical stage.”
Assistant Boone County prosecutor Yao Li, who argued that Buchanan should be pursuing his claims at the Missouri Supreme Court, also argued that the time for the challenge had long passed.
“The law of the case and lapse of jurisdiction prohibits him from raising the claim here,” Li wrote in his final brief to Harris.
Along with arguing that the 2003 resentencing was legal under state statute and rule, 
Buchanan contends he was never legally sentenced and that has prevented him from seeking post-conviction relief.
Buchanan doesn’t deny his guilt. He spoke at length about his case in an episode of the Netflix series “I am a Killer.”
“We can never change the fact that my family members lost their lives, my girl, my friend, was shot,” Buchanan said in an April interview at Jefferson City Correctional Center. “You can’t put time on that.”
But he claims he has no memory of the crime. He said he believes marijuana he smoked that night was laced with PCP and tests of sweat residue in the shirt he wore shows that.
He cannot pursue those arguments without a final sentence, Buchanan said Wednesday in a telephone interview. That is why he needs an in-person sentencing.
“Any court in Missouri is obligated to honor my federal rights, because I’m dealing with a constitutional right,” Buchanan said. “I have a constitutional right to be present.”

Young Library at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. (Mark Cornelison | UK Photo)The U.S. Department of Justice is suing Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Kentucky education officials to stop the state from granting in-state college tuition rates to immigrants who lack permanent legal status.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the lawsuit stems from a similar challenge in Texas. The Kentucky lawsuit also follows Republican President Donald Trump signing two executive orders earlier this year to “ensure illegal aliens are not obtaining taxpayer benefits or preferential treatment,” the DOJ said. 
The Justice Department filed the lawsuit Tuesday in the Eastern District of Kentucky, arguing the administrative regulation discriminates against U.S. citizens. The complaint says federal law prohibits “aliens not lawfully present” in the country from getting a benefit denied to out-of-state citizens. 
Named in the complaint are Beshear, Kentucky Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher and the Council on Postsecondary Education. 
“No state can be allowed to treat Americans like second-class citizens in their own country by offering financial benefits to illegal aliens,” said Bondi in a press release. “The Department of Justice just won on this exact issue in Texas, and we look forward to fighting in Kentucky to protect the rights of American citizens.”
Texas was the first state to offer some immigrants without permanent legal status in-state tuition 24 years ago, but it recently abruptly ended the policy after the Justice Department challenged it in court. 
According to the National Immigration Law Center, 25 states and Washington, D.C. have had “tuition equity” laws or policies that permit certain students who have attended and graduated from secondary schools in their state to pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities regardless of their immigrations status.
Crystal Staley, a spokesperson for Beshear told the Lantern in an email that the governor’s office has not been served with the lawsuit as of Wednesday morning “and had no advance notice, nor any prior discussion with the Department of Justice about it.” She added that the state regulation in question was issued by the Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) before 2010. Beshear was elected as governor in 2019. 
“Under Kentucky law, CPE is independent, has sole authority to determine student residency requirements for the purposes of in-state tuition, and controls its own regulations,” Staley said. “The Governor has no authority to alter CPE’s regulations and should not be a party to the lawsuit.”
CPE spokesperson Melissa Young said that its staff was reviewing the lawsuit and regulation as of Wednesday morning. 
Jennifer Ginn, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Department of Education, said Fletcher “is the chief state school officer for elementary and secondary education in Kentucky.” 
“He is not charged with oversight or management of Kentucky’s postsecondary education system,” she said. 
According to the National Immigration Law Center, 25 states and Washington, D.C. have had “tuition equity” laws or policies that permit certain students who have attended and graduated from secondary schools in their state to pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities regardless of their immigrations status.
Earlier this year, Republican state Rep. T.J Roberts, of Burlington, filed a bill to undo the Kentucky policy. However, it didn’t get a committee hearing in the GOP-controlled state legislature. In a Wednesday statement, Roberts praised the DOJ’s lawsuit and said the regulation discriminates against U.S. citizens “both those born here and those who have followed the lawful path to citizenship.”

Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesThe U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

(Courtesy of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency / David Esparza) Attorneys for state regulators and a Southern New Mexico water utility facing $250,000 in fines for arsenic level violations have agreed to push back hearings about the penalties.
The hearings scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday will now be held sometime in the fall, according to a joint motion filed last week by attorneys for Camino Real Regional Utility Authority and the New Mexico Environment Department.
The utility supplies water for more than 19,000 people in Sunland Park, Santa Teresa and southern Doña Ana County, an area with high levels of naturally-occurring arsenic in the groundwater.
State regulators first issued fines of more than $251,000 in March 2024, after findings that the utility’s arsenic treatment plants were “offline and bypassed” for more than a year, sending drinking water with “high levels of arsenic” to residents.
Drinking water with high levels of arsenic is associated with diseases such as diabetes, increased risk of cancers, and can contribute to heart and lung diseases and skin problems, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Utility leadership has said in statements that they take the concerns seriously and have worked to lower arsenic levels, achieving compliance with federal standards.
However, after a series of failed tests in May public officials and the state’s top environment officials said they’ve lost confidence in the utility’s leadership to address the chronic issues.
In late May, the New Mexico Environment Department filed an amended complaint, claiming that the utility delayed reporting elevated arsenic levels for multiple days and failed to specifically report them to the state.
“The continuing cycle of non-compliance by Respondent which compromises the public’s access to safe and reliable drinking water requires the application of a bad faith enhancement for each of the violations which are the subject of this enforcement action,” the amended complaint stated
Regulators raised the total fine to $252,000. Attorneys for the utility objected to the addition of new allegations for the upcoming June hearing, and requested more time to address them.
Both the utility  and the environment department agreed to a calendar extending witness and discovery deadlines into August, with a final date for the new hearing to follow.
The utility faces additional court dates beyond the administrative hearing later this year.
A 3rd Judicial District Judge ordered parties to submit a further schedule in the civil lawsuit the state  brought earlier this month against the utility, requesting the judge appoint a third party to take over the utility’s operations.
A hearing is scheduled for July in the civil lawsuit brought last year, which alleges the utility violated residents’ civil rights.

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Miami’s city commissioners voted Tuesday to enter into an agreement with the federal government authorizing local police to act as immigration enforcement officials.
The 3-2 vote followed that of other major Democratic cities in the state, such as Orlando and Jacksonville, which have already agreed to collaborate with federal officials in street-level immigration enforcement operations.
However, the decision came with heavy scrutiny from the public, with hundreds lining up outside under the scorching sun to get a chance to express their disapproval during the several hours of public comment.
“I feel the pain of our country; I feel the pain of my residents afraid to leave their homes, afraid to get medical attention for their children, and I don’t want to be a part of that,” said Christine King, chairwoman of the Miami Board of Commissioners. “I think we are on the wrong side if we enter into this agreement.”
The enactment of the 287(g) Task Force Model agreement, as the partnership is officially known, has been a significant aspect of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ push to promote the state as a leader in immigration enforcement. The governor persistently touts the hundreds of agreements that cities, state agencies, and even universities have signed up for.
But participation hasn’t all been voluntary. Attorney General James Uthmeier warned the Fort Myers commission and the Broward County sheriff that they could be removed from office after pushing back against the agreements.
City Attorney George Wysong and Miami Police Chief Manuel Morales brought up Uthmeier’s warnings during the meeting on Tuesday, saying that the city could face a suit from the state’s chief legal officer for rejecting the agreement.
Even the commissioners who voted in favor of the agreement with ICE didn’t do so gleefully. District 3 Commissioner Joe Carrollo, who represents Little Havana, said the city had to take the issue head-on.
“This is not an easy decision for me at all, but I’ve also heard what our police chief, what our attorney have said, and each of us is going to have to vote our conscience,” he said.
An outstanding lawsuit from the City of South Miami could provide clarity on whether state law requires cities to enter into the agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The overwhelming majority of the people speaking about the 287(g) agreement opposed it because they said it eroded trust in police in a city built by immigrants escaping dictatorships.
Karla De Anda, a community advocate who witnessed how a Cuban man tried to strangle himself after federal officials arrested him in Miami’s immigration court, said victims of crimes are too afraid to call the police for help.
“Every day we have received calls from domestic workers that have suffered mistreatment, sexual harassment, and even labor trafficking,” she said.
Others trying to sway commissioners against the agreement used their own experiences as immigrants or children of immigrants to make their points. Nick Mayor said the city had once welcomed his family with open arms.
“We need to have trust in our community, and this is eroding that right now before a single vote has been cast,” he said.

New York attorney Neil Barofsky came to that conclusion in a report released Tuesday, which called for the UAW’s executive board to reinstate the responsibilities that had been reassigned away from Secretary-Treasurer Margaret Mock after she refused to authorize certain expenditures for Fain’s office.
Barofsky was appointed to the independent oversight role in 2021 after an embezzlement and bribery scandal rocked the UAW, culminating with several top union leaders and auto executives going to prison. 
The dispute between Fain, who won election to head the union in March 2023, and Mock, became public last year, prompting Barofsky’s investigation. 
Among the allegations made by Fain and the union’s executive board against Mock were that she “weaponized” financial policies, obstructed operations, and sought to improperly influence votes by the board.
However, Barofsky concluded that the allegations “were either unsupported or outright unfounded,” and that the removal of Mock’s authority “was not the result of dereliction of duty or dishonesty, but rather a consequence of her refusal to grant exceptions to the strict policy restrictions governing the expenditure of Union resources, including to those within Fain’s inner circle.”
Barofsky also cited the testimony of multiple  witnesses, including at least one regional director, to an October 2023 staff meeting in which Fain said he would “cut the f—–g throats” of anyone who “messed with his people.” The director said Fain’s comment “speaks to retribution” as Fain is the union’s  “most powerful person.”
The report stands as a blemish against Fain’s reputation as having led a resurgence in the union’s power, including leading its successful 2023 “Stand Up Strike” against all three domestic automakers, which resulted in a 25% wage increase and an end to the two-tiered compensation system.

The union’s pull on politics in Michigan has been undeniable through the decades, with approximately 60% of UAW members and retirees historically voting for Democratic Party candidates. However, the union’s endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 failed to deliver the state to the Democratic column.
Mock, through her attorney, issued a statement following the report’s release calling for the union’s leadership to set aside past disputes and move forward in representing their members. 
“In unity and solidarity, let’s work together to confront employers and uncaring politicians who choose to wage war on the working class,” Mock said. 
However, Fain and 10 other UAW executive board members issued their own statement late Tuesday refuting the report’s conclusions and reiterating their view that Mock had obstructed “critical bargaining and organizing activities.”
“The UAW International Executive Board has taken multiple corrective steps to address these serious issues in a productive and proactive manner. We stand by our decisions,” the board members wrote.
Barofsky’s report did not provide for any sanctions against Fain or the union’s executive board, but did call for the reinstatement of those duties that had been  stripped from Mock, including authority over purchasing, benefits and pensions.

During a two-day status conference this week where the utility proposed to raise rates for the second time in as many years, residents and city officials told Wingate that JXN Water should first have to raise its collections rate — which is around 70%, far below the national average — before charging more to those who do pay. 
“To inflict another rate increase on the people who are playing by the rules is onerous to the city and its economic development,” Jackson Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote said. 
Henifin emphasized repeatedly that even with 100% collection, the current rates would leave the utility about $33 million short of its annual budget needs when accounting for paying off debts and building reserves.

The utility announced the proposal earlier this year after realizing it would soon run out of the $150 million in federal funding it received for operations. Henifin said he’s hoping to tap into some of the $450 million Jackson received for project spending, but added that will only cover operations for the short term. Wingate has the final say over the rate proposal, and said he would make a decision as early as next week.
JXN Water initially said the average single-family residence would see a roughly 12% increase, or about $9 a month, although it came out during the status conference that renters in apartment complexes may see a steeper rate hike. 
In one exchange, Wingate asked Foote where else the money could come from. The recently reelected councilman shrugged, suggesting JXN Water look for other sources. 
“That sounds really good,” the judge replied sarcastically. “What miracle do you have in mind?”
Hearing Foote’s and others’ concerns, though, Wingate asked Henifin how the utility plans to collect unpaid water bills from those who owe the most. There are 15 apartment complexes, largely run by out-of-state landlords, that owe a combined $5.7 million, JXN Water said. Henifin said he plans to sue them to force payment before considering shut offs. He estimated there are roughly 7,500 residents living on those properties, and said the landlords are “calling our bluff” as far as shutting off water to that many people.
In total, Henifin added, about 15,000 of the city’s water accounts — or about one in five — are still not paying.

An “affordable” combined water and sewer bill, according to Environmental Protection Agency’s recommendations, is no more than 4.5% of a person’s income. The proposed increase, Henifin said, would bring bills to 2.4% for the median Jackson household, but 5.7% for the city’s bottom quartile of earners. 
The utility’s SNAP recipient discount, which the utility hasn’t fully applied due to a legal roadblock, would bring that number down to 3.7%, he said, and he hopes to partner with the Mississippi Department of Human Services to boost enrollment in the benefit. 
Robert Ireland, an attorney with Jackson law firm Watkins & Eager PLLC who said he represents tenants in several apartment complexes, presented data during Monday’s status conference suggesting such customers would see a much steeper increase with the new rate hike than the average resident JXN Water described.
The utility uses a tiered rate structure that charges more per gallon for higher levels of water consumption. Because tenants in those complexes share a meter with the rest of their building, Ireland explained, their consumption is grouped together and is thus more expensive than it would be if they had separate meters. Ireland estimated for the 15,000 accounts at Jackson’s largest apartment complexes, they would see an average increase of $21, or more than double the increase JXN Water presented.
“I’m trying to push back on the notion that this is just going to be a small increase,” he told Wingate.
Aisha Carson, the utility’s communications officer, said JXN Water didn’t have an average for how much tenants of complexes would be paying under the new rates. Rates for complexes are calculated differently depending on the size and number of meters there, she explained.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06100112/3X0A3836-scaled.jpg,,,2025-06-18 13:09:30.025156

“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting transgender medical care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
Lawsuit seeks to block South Carolina law limiting transgender medical care options

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.

In its resolution, the council noted that a long list of presidents have praised Evers, who served as field secretary for the Mississippi NAACP until his 1963 assassination, including President Donald Trump.
In 2017, Trump attended the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and praised Evers, his widow, Myrlie Evers, and his brother, Charles Evers, who supported Trump in his campaign for president.
He noted that Medgar Evers “loved his family, his community, and his country.  And he knew it was long past time for his nation to fulfill its founding promise: to treat every citizen as an equal child of God.”
After his assassination, “Sergeant Evers was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors,” Trump said. “In Arlington, he lies beside men and women of all races, backgrounds, and walks of life who have served and sacrificed for our country. Their headstones do not mark the color of their skin, but immortalize the courage of their deeds.
“Their memories are carved in stone as American heroes. That is what Medgar Evers was. He was a great American hero. That is what the others honored in this museum were: true American heroes.”
Three years later, the Trump administration’s Interior Department established the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home as a national monument.
But after Trump started his second term in 2025, he signed an executive order to eliminate all Diversity, Equality and Inclusion programs.
In the wake of that order, Evers was erased from a section of the Arlington National Cemetery website that honored Black Americans who fought in the nation’s wars, although not from website itself.. 
A week after Pentagon leaders announced their intention to possibly rename the USNS Medgar Evers, christened for the World War II veteran and civil rights leader, his family urged the Department of Defense and the Navy to not do so.
The ship is one of eight vessels named after activists – among them Cesar Chavez, Harvey Milk, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Harriet Tubman – that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wants to rebrand in a large offensive against “wokeness” and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the military to reestablish the “warrior ethos.”
Jackson City Council member Aaron Banks said, “It’s unfortunate that our politics have gotten to a place where we are moving away from people like Medgar Evers. It was rough enough that they took his name out of Arlington Cemetery, but this is an even bigger blow.”
On Tuesday, Evers’ niece, Hinds County District 2 Supervisor Wanda Evers, told the council that this is heartbreaking to her.
“You do this for a man who fought for our country?” she asked. “It’s nothing but the devil working, and we’re going to let him play in his playground, and after that it’s over.”
She plans to meet personally with Trump regarding the matter, she said. “We are fighting this.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/11160220/AP111112134411.jpg,,,2025-06-18 13:09:30.025156

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A delayed legal fight over Indiana’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors can now move forward following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling Wednesday that upheld a similar law in Tennessee.
The high court’s 6-3 decision did not directly address Indiana’s law but affirmed that states can enforce bans on puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries for transgender youth. It agreed with an appellate court decision to reverse an injunction blocking the Tennessee law.
“This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. “The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound.”
Higher court strikes injunction on gender-affirming care, reinstating health care ban

But he said “our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita celebrated the ruling Wednesday morning, posting on X: “VICTORY! … This is a massive win for Hoosiers, protecting our kids from irreversible harm.” 
Rokita’s office co-led an amicus brief in support of Tennessee’s law.
Indiana lawmakers passed a similar ban in 2023, but a federal judge temporarily blocked parts of the law before it could take effect. That included halting enforcement of restrictions on hormone therapy and puberty blockers, though a ban on gender-affirming surgeries for minors remained untouched, given that such surgeries are rarely, if ever, performed on Hoosier youth.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit later allowed the full Indiana law to take effect, staying the lower court’s injunction. That decision meant transgender minors were no longer able to start new hormone treatments or receive puberty blockers after July 1, 2023.
The ongoing lawsuit over Indiana’s ban was paused while the U.S. Supreme Court weighed the Tennessee case. With Wednesday’s ruling, litigation in Indiana can resume — but under traditional judicial scrutiny, rather than the heightened review.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Indiana, which represents the plaintiffs in case against Indiana’s law, did not immediately comment on the Supreme Court’s decision.

Reaction from Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill:
“Puberty blockers and surgery for transgender minors aren’t “gender-affirming care.” These procedures permanently mutilate a child and have life-long physical and mental consequences – they are illegal in Louisiana. The Supreme Court got this one right. Great job by my friend, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti.”

The justices’ 6-3 decision in a case from Tennessee effectively protects from legal challenges many efforts by President Donald Trump’s Republican administration and state governments to roll back protections for transgender people. Another 26 states have laws similar to Tennessee’s.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a conservative majority that the law does not violate the Constitution’s equal protection clause, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.
“This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound,” Roberts wrote. “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best.”
In a dissent for the court’s three liberal justices that she summarized aloud in the courtroom, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims. In sadness, I dissent.”
The decision comes amid a range of other federal and state efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use. In April, Trump’s administration sued Maine for not complying with the government’s push to ban transgender athletes in girls sports.
The Republican president also has sought to block federal spending on gender-affirming medical care for those under age 19 — instead promoting talk therapy only to treat young transgender people. In addition, the Supreme Court has allowed him to kick transgender service members out of the military, even as court fights continue. The president also signed another order to define the sexes as only male and female.Trump’s administration has also called for using only therapy, not broader health measures, to treat transgender youths.
Several of the states where gender-affirming care has not been banned for minors have adopted laws or state executive orders seeking to protect it. But since Trump’s executive order calling for blocking federal funding for the treatment for those under 19, some providers have ceased some treatments. For instance, Penn Medicine in Philadelphia announced last month that it would not provide surgeries for patients under 19.
The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Dr. Susan Kressly, said in a statement the organization is “unwavering” in its support of gender-affirming care and “stands with pediatricians and families making health care decisions together and free from political interference.” Kressly said the Supreme Court’s decision “sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship.”
The justices acted a month after the United Kingdom’s top court delivered a setback to transgender rights, ruling unanimously that the U.K. Equality Act means trans women can be excluded from some groups and single-sex spaces, like changing rooms, homeless shelters, swimming areas and medical or counseling services provided only to women.
Five years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace. That decision is unaffected by Wednesday’s ruling.
But the justices Wednesday declined to apply the same sort of analysis the court used in 2020 when it found “sex plays an unmistakable role” in employers’ decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate. Roberts joined that opinion written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was part of Wednesday’s majority.
Justice Amy Coney Barrett also fully joined the majority but wrote separately to emphasize that laws classifying people based on transgender status should not receive any special review by courts. Barrett, also writing for justice Clarence Thomas, wrote that “courts must give legislatures flexibility to make policy in this area.”
Chase Strangio, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who argued the case for transgender minors and their families, said in a statement that the ruling “is a devastating loss for transgender people, our families, and everyone who cares about the Constitution.”
Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti on social media called the ruling a “Landmark VICTORY for Tennessee at SCOTUS in defense of America’s children!”
There are about 300,000 people between the ages of 13 and 17 and 1.3 million adults who identify as transgender in the United States, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. The Williams Institute is a think tank that researches sexual orientation and gender identity demographics to inform laws and public policy decisions.
When the case was argued in December, then-President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration and families of transgender adolescents called on the high court to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans.
They argued the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
Tennessee’s law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors but allows the same drugs to be used for other purposes.
Soon after Trump took office, the Justice Department told the court its position had changed.
A major issue in the case was the appropriate level of scrutiny courts should apply to such laws.
The lowest level is known as rational basis review, and almost every law looked at that way is upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, within their authority.
The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, which applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show the law helps accomplish it.
Roberts’ 24-page majority opinion was devoted almost entirely to explaining why the Tennessee law, known as SB1, should be evaluated under the lower standard of review. The law’s restrictions on treating minors for gender dysphoria turn on age and medical use, not sex, Roberts wrote.
Doctors may prescribe puberty blockers and hormone therapy to minors of any sex to treat some disorders, but not those relating to transgender status, he wrote.
But in her courtroom statement, Sotomayor asserted that similar arguments were made to defend the Virginia law prohibiting interracial marriage that the Supreme Court struck down in 1967.
“A ban on interracial marriage could be described in the same way as the majority described SB1,” she said.
Roberts rejected the comparison in his opinion.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SCOTUS-TRANS-CARE-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 13:09:30.025156

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

The Tennessee House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”",https://stateline.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2188214627.jpg,,,2025-06-18 12:17:55.945819

Thom Tillis to preserve tax credits and jobs in the massive budget reconciliation bill making its way through Congress.
The advocates gathered outside of Tillis’ Greensboro office to deliver the message.
Fueled in part by tax credits from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, speakers said, North Carolina has become a leader in the clean energy economy. The state has more than 20,000 clean energy jobs and $2 billion in clean energy investments.
These gains would be jeopardized by the House version of the reconciliation bill that would remove clean energy provisions and stop clean energy progress, speakers said.
“It can even cause North Carolina tens of thousands of jobs by 2030, along with billions of clean energy investments, sparred by clean energy and manufacturing tax credits,” Dan Crawford, governmental relations director at the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, said. “We simply can’t afford to lose these jobs right now in North Carolina.”
Crawford said North Carolina is “well positioned” to continue success from the Inflation Reduction Act — clean energy projects make up a quarter of economic development initiatives across the state last year, according to the Chambers for Innovation and Clean Energy.
Repealing tax credits in the reconciliation bill could also raise electricity costs for North Carolina families by more than $200 each year, Crawford said.
“Congress could choose a commonsense approach that protects local jobs and doesn’t raise costs,” he said.
Thom Kay is the energy transition policy manager at BlueGreen Alliance, a nonprofit that unifies labor unions and environmental organizations to fight climate change.
The group also works towards protecting the health of people in the environment, standing against economic and racial inequality, and developing union jobs across the country.
“By our best estimates, North Carolina has benefitted from more than $30 billion of private investment related to these federal investments and tax credits,” Kay said. “These are already working to strengthen our state’s position as a leader in energy and manufacturing.”
Tillis, who will seek reelection next year, has previously hinted that he could be receptive to some of the advocates’ arguments. Elizabeth Ouzts of Canary Media reported earlier this month that “Tillis is among four Senate Republicans who signed an April letter urging a targeted approach to reforming renewable energy tax incentives rather than a wholesale repeal.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solar-array-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-18 12:17:55.945819

My parents came to this country from Mexico at a young age with nothing but a dream for a better life. They spoke very little English but their accomplishments are far from that. As a family, we didn’t have much financially, but my parents always made it a priority to provide us the best education they could afford. My story may be one in thousands that are similar, but it’s still just as important as any other. 
When I decided to pursue an education after high school, I knew it would be an uphill battle. With fear and uncertainty about how I would afford a college tuition, an answer to my prayers came to my door. I received a letter from Gateway Community College (now CT State) informing me that I qualify for the PACT (Pledge to Advance Connecticut) program. 
Suddenly all the anxiety and fear I had disappeared. Having the privilege of receiving PACT during community college was truly a blessing. PACT allowed me to participate fully in my education without worrying about how I would afford it. When I graduated from community college and enrolled at Southern Connecticut State University, it felt like a rude awakening. Even with an outstanding GPA and financial aid, my tuition skyrocketed from $0 a year to a daunting $7,000 a semester. All the anxiety and fear that had once been relieved came rushing back. 
Like many students from families with limited financial means, I worked two part-time jobs while balancing a full academic load. I could no longer fully participate in my education the way I once could, forced to work long hours just to afford it. According to research from the Nation Center on Education Statistics (NCES), students who work 25 hours or more per week are less likely than those who don’t work at all, or only work less than 20 hours per week, to complete their bachelor’s degrees within six years. It’s a vicious cycle. Students overwork themselves and take on multiple jobs to pursue a higher education. Even worse, some take a break or withdraw from school entirely because they can not afford it.
Connecticut has ensured access to affordable tuition in community colleges, but why should those who choose to continue their education at four-year state colleges be left behind, overworked and forced to prioritize jobs over education? The current PACT program, now called the Mary Ann Handley Award, only applies to community colleges, and I firmly believe it’s time to extend the program to all Connecticut state colleges. 
The cost of tuition keeps rising and students are burdened with debt more than ever before. According to NBC Connecticut, the Board of Regents approved a 5% increase in tuition and fees for state university and college students, with an average increase of $334 a year in tuition. These rising costs make it increasingly difficult for students, especially those from low-income families, to stay enrolled and focus on their education. 
Expanding the Mary Ann Handley Award makes the statement that a quality, affordable education should not be a privilege– it should be a right. It would give all students the chance to graduate without the crushing weight of loans and empower them to reach their fullest potential.
There’s no denying that public higher education is a powerful tool for social mobility. It unlocks new opportunities, breaks generational cycles of poverty, and helps build a better future for the state of Connecticut. When more students graduate without debt, they are better positioned to give back to their communities and contribute to the economy. For example, CTPost states that more Connecticut born college graduates are staying in state, helping to bolster the state’s workforce. This reinforces the importance of making higher education more accessible and affordable, investing in education is investing in Connecticut’s future. Furthermore, the PACT program simply cannot stand for a “pledge to advance Connecticut” if it fails to aid a great portion of Connecticut that would help advance the state. 
As a first-generation Mexican American student, I am living proof that with the right support, higher education can change lives. I was fortunate to have had access to the PACT program during my time at community college, but too many students are still missing out on this life-changing opportunity. Higher education has improved every aspect of my life. It has opened many doors and inspired me to dream bigger than I ever thought possible.

After the screening, there will be a panel discussion exploring Hamer’s enduring legacy with the film’s producer and Hamer’s niece, Monica Land, and activist and Humanities Council Board Chair Leslie Burl McLemore. Stuart Rockoff, executive director of the MHC, will moderate the discussion. 
“I am really excited to be a part of the screening on the life of Fannie Lou Hamer,” McLemore said. “She was a personal friend of mine, and I remember when I first met Mrs. Hamer back in 1963. We were riding a bus from Cleveland, Mississippi, to Dorchester County, Georgia, to participate in a Citizenship Education Workshop.
“We were talking about our background and what we had been doing in the movement, and Mrs. Hamer, in less than a year,” he continued, “had been evicted from the W.D. Marlow III plantation in Sunflower County. And as she told her story about that eviction, the history of Sunflower County and the history of her family, there were about 25 to 30 of us in the room, and there was not a dry eye in the room. Mrs. Hamer really impacted my life profoundly.” 
Organizers said the event is also a call to action. The Department of Government Efficiency eliminated National Endowment for the Humanities grants. The Humanities Council is turning to the community to help sustain the programming that federal support once made possible. DOGE’s cuts jeopardizes more than 35 grants that the Humanities Council already had awarded for programs like an oral history of former Gov. Kirk Fordice’s time in office, a museum exhibit on Mississippians who fought and died in the Vietnam War, and lectures about the work and legacy of artist Walter Anderson.
Proceeds from Saturday’s screening will directly support the Mississippi Humanities Council’s ongoing work to bring public programs, educational opportunities and cultural initiatives to communities across the state.  
“The Mississippi Humanities Council gave us our first grant and several grants after that to fund our mission to preserve and amplify Aunt Fannie Lou’s voice,” Land, the film’s producer, said. “Without their support, there would be no Fannie Lou Hamer’s America.” 
Premiering on PBS and WORLD Channel in February 2022, “Fannie Lou Hamer’s America” allows the late activist and humanitarian to tell her own story in her own words – spoken and sung – through archival audio and video footage. In December 2022, the film was named “Best TV Feature Documentary Or Mini-Series” by the International Documentary Association and in 2023, it won the “Best Documentary” award by The National Association for Multi-ethnicity in Communications.  
The goal of the film and its website, www.fannielouhamersamerica.com is to teach others about Hamer’s work, accomplishments and legacy, and to serve as a clearinghouse of all things Fannie Lou Hamer. Its K-12 Educational Curriculum, Find Your Voice, features original lesson plans written by educators in the Mississippi Delta, a children’s book, an animated BrainPOP movie and a free STEM program, the Sunflower County Film Academy for high school students in Hamer’s native Mississippi Delta. 
The MHC has funded each element of the curriculum and in March 2022 awarded the project the Preserver of Mississippi Culture Award at their 25th annual gala. 
“Participating in this event is so important to me because of the work the MHC has done to continually support our vision,” Land said. 
Hamer’s educational website will soon feature a digital library and museum.  Doors open at 6:30 p.m. at the Strand Theatre, 717 Clay St., Vicksburg, with the screening at 7 p.m. followed by the panel discussion.

Read this story in English.
Más de seis docenas de leyes de Connecticut, incluyendo el próximo presupuesto estatal y el paquete de bonos, entrarán en vigor total o parcialmente el 1 de julio.
Las leyes de Connecticut son aprobadas por la Asamblea General durante el periodo de sesiones legislativas de cada año (este año se extendió del 8 de enero al 4 de junio) o en un periodo extraordinario de sesiones. Suelen entrar en vigor el 1 de enero, el 1 de julio o el 1 de octubre.
A continuación, un vistazo a algunas de las docenas de leyes que se implementarán el próximo mes.
Nuevo presupuesto estatal bienal
Sujeto a la firma del Gobernador Ned Lamont, el próximo presupuesto estatal bienal de Connecticut entrará en vigor al comienzo del próximo año fiscal, que es el 1 de julio.
El presupuesto prioriza a la infancia, aumentaría los fondos para agencias de servicios sociales sin fines de lucro dentro de dos años y aumentaría los impuestos a las corporaciones. También reduce drásticamente el apoyo prometido a los proveedores de atención médica que atienden a personas de bajos recursos y se basa en maniobras contables para cumplir con el límite de gasto constitucional del estado.
Lamont elogió el proyecto de ley tras su aprobación.
En los años impares, la Asamblea General aprueba un presupuesto para los dos años fiscales siguientes. En los años pares, los legisladores pueden optar por ajustarlo.
Paquete de bonos de $9.7 mil millones
También pendiente de la firma de Lamont, un paquete de bonos de $9.7 mil millones para financiar la construcción de escuelas, mejoras en el transporte y otros proyectos de capital para los dos próximos años fiscales entrará en vigor el 1 de julio.
El plan de endeudamiento ampliaría la ayuda no educativa para ciudades y pueblos, aumentaría la vivienda asequible y combatiría la falta de vivienda, reforzaría la seguridad en los lugares de culto y apoyaría la construcción y renovación de guarderías.
Recomienda nuevas inversiones de capital en educación superior, incluyendo $5 millones para impulsar la renovación planificada del ‘Gampel Pavilion’ en la Universidad de Connecticut, y un nuevo programa de $60 millones para ayudar a los distritos escolares de primaria y secundaria a financiar proyectos de renovación a pequeña escala.
Requisitos educativos en las escuelas públicas
A partir del año escolar 2025-26, las escuelas públicas de Connecticut deberán añadir dos unidades a su currículo de estudios sociales: historia de los asiático-americanos e isleños del Pacífico, y educación cívica y alfabetización mediática.
La disposición sobre los Estudios Asiático-Americanos e Isleños del Pacífico (AAPI), parte de un proyecto de ley aprobado por los legisladores en 2022, exige que las escuelas enseñen la historia de los asiático-americanos e isleños del Pacífico en el estado, la región y el país, incluyendo las contribuciones de las personas y comunidades AAPI a los avances en las artes, las ciencias, el gobierno, la economía y los derechos civiles de Estados Unidos.
Una ley independiente, aprobada en 2023, exige las clases de educación cívica y alfabetización mediática. La educación cívica se define en el proyecto de ley como “el estudio de los derechos y obligaciones de los ciudadanos”, y la alfabetización mediática abarcará el papel de todos los medios de comunicación en la sociedad y cómo utilizar, evaluar y analizar los medios que una persona consume o crea.
Grabaciones en las urnas de voto en ausencia
A partir del 1 de julio, los municipios deben haber implementado tecnología de grabación de video, con comprobante de fecha y hora, en cada una de sus urnas de voto en ausencia. Se les exigirá que comiencen a registrar las urnas el primer día que se emitan las papeletas de voto en ausencia para una elección o primaria y que continúen haciéndolo hasta que el secretario municipal retire las últimas papeletas.
La ley también exige que las grabaciones se pongan a disposición del público lo antes posible, y a más tardar cinco días después de la última retirada de papeletas por parte del secretario municipal, y que las conserven durante al menos un año.
Los legisladores aprobaron este requisito tras un escándalo de abuso de papeletas de voto en ausencia en Bridgeport, donde un tribunal ordenó la repetición de las primarias demócratas de la ciudad de 2023, tras la aparición de un video de la vicepresidenta del Comité Municipal Demócrata, Wanda Geter-Pataky, en el que aparentemente depositaba múltiples papeletas de voto en ausencia en una urna de Bridgeport.
Cinco personas, entre ellas Geter-Pataky y tres concejales de Bridgeport, han sido acusadas de delitos electorales como parte de una extensa investigación sobre dichas primarias.
Límites a los contratos de libros electrónicos en bibliotecas
Este año, los legisladores aprobaron un proyecto de ley diseñado para abordar los altos costos que las bibliotecas incurren al comprar libros electrónicos y audiolibros, prohibiéndoles firmar contratos con editoriales de libros electrónicos que contengan términos que algunos legisladores consideran restrictivos.
Los contratos de libros electrónicos para bibliotecas suelen incluir cláusulas que obligan a la biblioteca a volver a comprar el libro después de haberlo prestado 26 veces o cada dos años. La ley prohíbe a las bibliotecas contratar con editoriales que impongan restricciones simultáneas al período de préstamo de un libro electrónico y al número de veces que las personas pueden pedirlo prestado.
Aunque la ley entra en vigor el 1 de julio, solo se implementará si uno o más estados con una población total o combinada de 7 millones de habitantes promulgan leyes similares, y exige que el bibliotecario estatal verifique trimestralmente si otros estados han aprobado una ley similar.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children. Tennessee House Republicans are pleased by the court’s courage to stand firm against ideology that denies biological reality. The sterilization and disfigurement of children will no longer be normalized. As we celebrate the precedent set by this decision, we remain committed to leading the nation in safeguarding the health, safety and future of all children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Tomorrow, communities across the country observe Juneteenth — a federal holiday celebrating freedom for all. 
On June 19, 1865, troops arrived in Galveston Texas and announced the end of slavery – more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. It was declared a federal holiday in 2021 by then President Joe Biden. 
State Rep. Earl Harris Jr. and chair of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus commemorated the holiday while calling on the state for inclusive American education. 
During the 2025 General Assembly lawmakers crafted Senate Enrolled Act 289, banning diversity, equity and inclusion practices in government agencies, including universities. Harris also called out Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith on “shameful whitewashing” of slavery. 
Beckwith posted a statement on X, defending the Three-Fifths Compromise after a debate over the bill on April 24. 
Harris said the IBLC will continue to work to remove blockages and create equal opportunities for all Hoosiers. 
“This starts in the classroom. Teaching our children true American history – the good, the bad and the ugly – will help us ensure that the achievements of African Americans, the horrors we faced and contributions we’re making today will not be forgotten,” he said. “Some of the steps our Republican supermajority took in the most recent session of the Indiana General Assembly actively work against this goal. We should never shy away from our history – the strength of our democracy depends on us confronting our past and working to create a future where all people are extended the promise of America.”
While Juneteenth is a federal holiday, the state does not recognize it. State offices remain open, including the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Most private businesses operate at their own discretion. 
The Federal Reserve will close, meaning most major banks will also close. Online banking and ATMs will remain available. The New York Stock Exchange will close as well. 
The U.S. Postal Service will not deliver mail. However, UPS and FedEx will continue pickup and delivery services. 
Despite a lack of state acknowledgement, communities across Indiana are hosting celebrations to honor Juneteenth including the Indiana State Fairgrounds and Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_2557-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-18 12:17:55.945819

Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who stepped down from her position in April citing President Donald Trump’s priority of Russia over Ukraine in peace talks after Russia’s invasion, announced Wednesday she’s running for Congress in Michigan.
Brinks, a Michigan native, is running as a Democrat for the state’s 7th Congressional District, which Democrats and Republicans will both be focused on as partisan control of the area has fluctuated in recent years in battleground state Michigan. Currently, Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett of Charlotte is serving his first term in the district. The seat was previously held by Democrat Elissa Slotkin before she won election to the U.S. Senate in 2024.
In an op-ed published by the the Detroit Free Press in May, Brink said despite serving under five presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, in various roles in national security and foreign policy for three decades, it became clear to her from the beginning of the Trump administration that it would pressure Ukraine to work towards peace instead of the “aggressor”, Russia.
“Peace at any price is not peace at all ― it is appeasement. And history has taught us time and again that appeasement does not lead to safety, security or prosperity. It leads to more war and suffering,” Brink said in her op-ed.
In her campaign announcement video, Brink painted a picture of the situation in Ukraine, where more than 10,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed during Russia’s full-scale invasion, which began in 2022. Brink said her work as ambassador to Ukraine for three years was an exercise in America’s commitment to democracy, and allies like her had the shrapnel lodged in their homes from Russian missiles to prove it.

Brink is the first Democrat to officially throw their hat in the ring for what has the potential to be a competitive race, though there are other key Democrats who could announce a bid, including former House Minority Leader Donna Lasinski (D-Scio Township) and Matt Maasdam, a retired Navy SEAL who once served as a military aide for former President Barack Obama.
In her campaign announcement Brink touted her work in foreign policy, but also expressed pride in her family’s history in Michigan, spanning six generations. 
Brink said in the announcement that both domestically and abroad, Democracy is under attack, from the Trump administration’s approach to Russia to restrictions on abortion rights.
“Appeasing a dictator never has and never will achieve a lasting peace. And it’s just not who we are,” Brink said. “ Because of this after nearly thirty years of service I felt it was my duty to step down so I could speak out. We must stand strong against aggressors, protect democracy, fight for freedom at home and abroad and be on the right side of history.”

About a third of the state’s child deaths and near-deaths were because a youngster accessed dangerous substances, the annual Child Fatality and Near Fatality External Review Panel report showed. 
Despite that, “less than one in four caregivers report using safe storage practices for medication at home,” Kosair for Kids said Wednesday in announcing its education campaign. 
KY urged to do more to protect children from accidental shootings, drug ingestion

To address that, Kosair and its Face It initiative, which works to end child abuse, has a website, video public service announcements and a printable flyer featuring safe storage tips. Those tips include: 

Keep prescriptions and over-the-counter medications up and away, in a locked container or medication safe.  
Ask family and guests if they have medication in their purse or luggage so you can put it away safely while at your home.     
Keep track of the number of pills/strips you have in your medication bottle so you can know how many a child may have ingested.  
Program the Poison Control Center number in your phone and keep it posted on your refrigerator. It is 800-222-1222. 

Dr. Christina Howard, child abuse pediatrician and chief of the Division of Pediatric Forensic Medicine at Kentucky Children’s Hospital, said in a statement that “any opioid that is not taken as directed can have dangerous side effects including overdose.” Overdoses should be treated with Narcan and a 911 call, she said. 
“These tragedies are easily preventable,” Barry Dunn, the president and CEO of Kosair for Kids, said in a statement. “Kosair for Kids is committed to ensuring families have what they need for their children to grow up healthy and safe from harm. That is why we prioritize parent and caregiver education, free tools like lockboxes available to families, and changing simple, everyday habits. We can and must keep harmful substances out of the hands of young children.”

In United States v.

The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”

Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman applauded the decision, saying it will “protect our young people from irreparable damage.” Coleman, a Republican, said the Supreme Court’s reasoning also applies to a similar Kentucky law. 
Chris Hartman, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, called the decision “unconscionable” and said the court’s majority had ruled “in favor of discrimination and against best practice medical care for transgender youth.”
“There remain more than two-dozen states and territories where families can access the medical care they need,” Hartman said. “Today’s ruling won’t change that, and it won’t stop families from seeking out this crucial care for their children. Shame on the Supreme Court and state lawmakers, who work to keep transgender kids in their crosshairs for nothing more than political gain.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature enacted the ban on gender affirming care for minors in 2023, over Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld both states’ laws in a combined decision in September 2023. The Supreme Court granted review in only Tennessee’s case. Coleman and 21 other attorneys general filed a brief with the Supreme Court supporting the Tennessee law.  
After Wednesday’s Supreme Court ruling, Coleman issued a statement, saying, “As parents and public officials, we have a responsibility to protect our children from harm. That’s exactly what Kentucky’s General Assembly did with the passage of SB 150, creating a commonsense measure to safeguard minors from life-altering medical procedures.”. 


Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.

By 69 percent to 31 percent, the 239 representative voters at Milton's special Town Meeting passed zoning language that would lay the groundwork for potentially 2,461 new units in the town, complying with the controversial state multi-family housing law.
The post Milton Town Meeting decides to comply with MBTA Communities law  appeared first on CommonWealth[...]","AFTER TWO NIGHTS and nearly six hours of impassioned and sometimes pointed debate, Milton Town Meeting members voted to pass new zoning that would open the door to more multi-family housing and make it compliant with the MBTA Communities housing law. 
By 69 percent to 31 percent, the 239 representative voters passed zoning language through a citizen’s petition that would lay the groundwork for potentially 2,461 new units – 25 percent of the town’s current total – though similar zoning around the country and the broader housing market suggest the final number will be far less over a significant period of time. 
The vote will bring the town into compliance with the law requiring municipalities served by the MBTA system to zone for a district of reasonable size that allows a certain number of multi-family housing units, depending on the town’s size and proximity to different modes of transit. But it hardly puts a button on a zoning fight that Town Meeting members note has “pitted neighbor against neighbor” and spawned several expensive legal disputes. 
Some members attempted to toss, without a full vote, a less dense zoning plan – supported by the planning board and warrant committee – that treats the town as “adjacent” to public transit and zone for 10 percent of total units, despite the state housing office’s assertion that the affluent Boston suburb is a “rapid transit” community served by the quaint and occasionally shambolic Mattapan High-Speed Trolley that extends from the end of the Red Line subway.  
Planning board, select board, and warrant committee members ultimately agreed, to enthusiastic applause, to support a motion to send the 10 percent option back to the planning board for study. Some 93 percent of Town Meeting members voted to do so. 
Town Meeting – a form of local governance used for over 300 years in New England – in Milton involves a group of elected members that vote on behalf of the town’s residents on a wide array of matters including zoning. A gathering of Town Meeting in 2023 approved an MBTA Communities compliant plan for Milton, only for it to be tossed 54 to 46 percent in a referendum in 2024.  
Both Monday and Tuesday nights included familiar airing of grievances against the compliance process, with meeting members decrying the housing office’s rezoning rules as “backward,” “unfair,” “unreasonable,” an edict to just “jam it in” on the potential new units, and a “fast-track for developers” to reshape several areas of the town. 
Proponents of the higher density plan also offered familiar notes of support. Some said it was a responsible move and that increasing housing is “essential” to public health and safety, while others warned “if we don’t do it, the state will do it for us, so let’s do it.” 
“All I’m asking us to do tonight is to support [the 25 percent plan] so that we can comply with the law,” urged Board of Appeals chair Kathleen O’Donnell. “And if in some random fashion we get reclassified in some way or some manner, we can come back to Town Meeting, and do our job, and do a different zoning plan. But let’s comply with the law; let’s do our best to support the common good of the people in our Commonwealth.” 
The Supreme Judicial Court in February determined, after considering a suit brought to force Milton into compliance, that the multi-family housing law is constitutional and enforceable by the broad powers of the attorney general. But the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities had promulgated its regulations incorrectly and must re-do them, the court concluded. Under new emergency regulations, the housing office gave communities that had delayed compliance until mid-July to submit compliant plans. 
Several Milton residents warned that the 25 percent rezoning, which sets out specific rules for requiring up to 10 percent of the rezoned units be affordable, would result in more 40B projects. These are developments that receive a streamlined approval process if at least 20 to 25 percent of the units have affordable housing restrictions. 
Opponents of the higher density plan consistently urged other Town Meeting members to approve the lower density option, await a ruling from a Superior Court judge considering whether the town is truly rapid transit, and reserve the option to rezone with higher density later. 
“Residents of Milton came to Milton, and bought homes in Milton, because they like Milton as it exists, not because they hoped Milton would evolve to become something different,” said planning board member Sean Fahy. “It’s our responsibility to preserve Milton as it exists, to the greatest extent possible. By doing so, we’re honoring the commitment of the many residents that have invested in Milton and that are annually relied upon to support Milton financially by paying their taxes.” 
And that old-timey trolley – the only line of 1930s-era Presidents’ Conference Committee streetcars still in service across the country apart from the system in Philadelphia – remains a point of contention.  
Th trolley is fundamentally different from the subway lines across the MBTA and is therefore not rapid transit, argued Town Meeting member Mark Christo. Only a few hundred board the single-car trolleys at a handful of small stops each day and the entire length is above ground, he said. 
“It has not the ability to support [the housing office’s] most ambitious 25 percent zoning demand,” he said. 
To 25 percent plan proponents, this objection is missing the point.  
“Just as the sun rises in the east and one plus one equals two, the Mattapan line is rapid transit,” said Matthew Morong, who works in transit systems and supports the 25 percent plan. The line’s service “should be better than it is,” he agreed, and “the people of Mattapan, Milton, and Dorchester all deserve better.” But that should not be an impediment to doing what the state asks in terms of rezoning, he said, while also fiercely advocating for the state to support the area by making long-promised improvements to the line. 
Town Meeting member Karen Friedman-Hanna, who championed the citizen’s petition, said that the 25 percent zoning plan she and her fellow residents put forward was the very same one that the planning board agreed in May to send to Town Meeting and later revoked in favor of only submitting the 10 percent plan. Planning board members remain divided. 
The 25 percent plan that the citizens used is information that “the planning board studied, without a doubt,” said planning board chair Meredith Hall. But when the board looked at the impact to Milton Village and along the Eliot Street corridor, she said, “those impacts were what caused us to say ‘You know what, we find this to be too much density,’ and why we reverted and went back to the 10 percent plan.” 
The housing office reiterated this week that the 10 percent plan was not compliant, Friedman-Hanna noted, and elected officials including Town Meeting and the town’s boards are obligated to “comply with the law.” All attempts to modify the classification have failed, she said, and it only has until July 14 to become compliant. 
“This has already cost the town hundreds of thousands of dollars – money which we do not have,” Friedman-Hanna said. “Ongoing frivolous costs because of our noncompliance will wipe out a portion of the benefit that we just received from a huge override that was needed just for basic level funded services. That’s not okay.” 
Town Administrator Nicholas Milano said that the town applied for just over $800,000 in grants and was told it would have received the money if not for its noncompliance. The town’s legal arrangement with Goodwin Procter, for the case that went before the Supreme Judicial Court and ended with a ruling that the law is constitutional if the regulations are put out correctly, cost $275,000. The town attorney has incurred about another $45,000 in MBTA Communities related exposes since then, Milano said.  
On Monday, the Select Board accepted a $250,000 grant from the Municipal Fiber Grant Program that is contingent on being compliant with MBTA Communities law, Milano said. Other recently applied-for state grants targeting infrastructure improvement in East Milton and housing production would also presumably depend on compliance, he said. Milton public school officials also listed an array of grants, from computer science to reading programs, that they are not able to apply for because of noncompliance. 
Even as 10 percent proponents – including most of the planning board and the warrant committee tasked with approving articles for the Town Meetings – argued that the best move is to wait and see if the courts weigh in on classification, the majority of Town Meeting cast a vote to move forward with compliance as the state defines it. 
Town meeting member Douglas Hyne, as the body debated on Tuesday whether to consider the 10 percent plan at all, expressed befuddlement. Since 25 is more than 10, he said, by definition they would be in compliance even if the classification were changed. The voting body could always come back to reconsider a lower density option if a court or the Legislature reclassified Milton, he noted. But this vote would temporarily ensure their compliance, he said. 
“We’re not deciding whether we like this law, we’re not deciding whether or not we’re scared of the ramifications of this law, we’re not deciding whether or not it’s fair. That’s not how this can be decided,” Hyne said during remarks on Monday night. “Because when I decide whether or not to follow the law, I generally ask, ‘Is it the law?’ ‘Yes.’ That’s the end of my inquiry.”

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)While on her way home from a coworking space in Denver last year, Colorado state Rep. Jenny Willford says she was sexually assaulted by her Lyft driver.
In her lawsuit filed against Lyft in January, Willford alleges she was “subjected to unwelcome, nonconsensual sexual contact, touching” and lewd comments during the ride.
Willford was picked up by a different driver than the person identified in the Lyft app, according to the suit.
Her experience — and those that other survivors shared with her after hearing her story — prompted Willford, a Democrat, to introduce legislation this year that aimed to require safety measures for both riders and drivers using ridesharing apps.
“In my mind, all of these things are very basic when it comes to safety,” Willford said. “They’re just so common sense that it’s been really disheartening and frustrating to me that Uber … threatened to leave the state if the bill becomes law.”
Her bill would have required rideshare companies to conduct more regular background checks for drivers, to create a program for passengers or drivers who want to audio or video record their rides and to develop other safety policies.
But following Uber’s threats to leave the state if the measure passed, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it in late May. The bill would jeopardize rideshare services in Colorado “to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers,” his veto letter said.
Colorado isn’t alone. State and city leaders across the country are looking for ways to make rideshares safer. But lobbying campaigns from Uber and Lyft in many cases are blocking legislation meant to strengthen protections for both drivers and passengers.
Uber and Lyft, the two companies that dominate the U.S. rideshare industry, argue they have sufficient safety features within their apps.
“At Uber, we put safety at the heart of our operations, using technology, transparency, and accountability to help protect riders, drivers, and the broader community, with robust background checks and safety features like Audio and Video Recording, the Emergency Button, PIN verification, and RideCheck,” Uber wrote in a statement to Stateline.
“We remain committed to this work, and to dialogue with bill sponsors on sensible policies that keep people safe while protecting privacy and access.”
But there’s still a gap in regulations for rideshare companies because of their evolving technologies, said Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy, a left-leaning anti-poverty advocacy organization.
“Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers —that sort of work is relatively new, so there’s not a clear standard,” Roque said.
Uber and Lyft are employing lobbyists at the state and local levels. In Rhode Island, another state where legislators are pushing rideshare safety bills that the companies have objected to, Uber is on pace to spend $50,000 this year on lobbyists, according to the state’s lobbying database. Lyft has been spending $5,000 monthly on lobbyists in Rhode Island.
Across the country, Uber and Lyft have testified against measures in state legislative hearings and city council meetings. In Colorado’s case, a number of officials representing Uber spoke out against Willford’s legislation at committee hearings, while Lyft sent a letter to Gov. Polis urging him to veto it. Jerry Golden, Lyft’s chief policy officer, wrote in the letter that the legislation’s requirements “ignore and ultimately will not improve conditions for riders and drivers.”
Uber told the state Senate it would be “impossible” for rideshare companies to comply with the bill’s requirements immediately upon approval and that the  audio and video requirement is “not possible to enforce.”
“The intention of my legislation was never to drive out Uber or Lyft,” Willford said. “The intention was always to require a higher level of accountability and safety from them. But we can’t do that if they’re going to throw tantrums and pick up their toys and go home every time somebody asks them to do better.”
 
Safety for passengers
 


As a part of Lyft’s safety measures, drivers must complete annual background checks and mandatory driver safety education. The app is also programmed to check in with riders when drivers take long stops or deviate from the route they were assigned.
Uber conducts periodic criminal screenings for all active drivers and requires drivers to regularly verify their identity by sharing a selfie with Uber using the app. Both companies offer live emergency assistance to riders.
Between 2020 and 2022, Lyft reported 23 fatal physical assaults of people using the Lyft platform and 2,651 instances of the five most serious categories of sexual assault, according to its 2024 Safety Transparency Report. While incidents of sexual assault had decreased 21% since the last report, which covered 2017-2019, fatal physical assaults jumped by 185%.
Uber saw 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022 and 2,717 incidents of the most serious categories of sexual assault, according to the company’s most recent safety report. Despite a 22% decline in sexual assault and misconduct, there was an increase in fatal physical assaults since its 2019-2020 report.
State lawmakers in several states have tried to address rideshare safety concerns with varying degrees of success.
Pending legislation in New Jersey and Massachusetts aims to prevent sexual assault and misconduct against passengers.
The New Jersey measure would require rideshare companies to share information concerning sexual misconduct investigations into a driver and would allow companies to ban drivers during an investigation. It remains in committee.
The bill in Massachusetts, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Rausch, would create a specific criminal penalty for the sexual assault of a passenger by a rideshare driver. The bill also would deem any rideshare passenger incapable of consenting to any sexual contact during a ride.  A hearing on the bill took place yesterday.
“We need to be able to make sure that people are safe and that people can trust those kinds of spaces to be safe,” Rausch said.
In May, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation that creates criminal penalties for impersonating a rideshare driver. Starting July 1, the crime counts as a second-degree misdemeanor. Uber supported the legislation.
But in Rhode Island, Lyft is pushing against legislation that would require fingerprinting as part of criminal background check. Brendan Joyce, the Lyft public policy manager, testified against the measure in April, saying the fingerprinting requirement relies on the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information System, which Joyce said has incomplete data. He also asserted that fingerprint checks “disproportionately impact and have potential discriminatory effects on communities of color.” Uber also testified against the proposal.
Rhode Island legislators introduced another measure that would prevent people under the age of 16 from using a rideshare service alone. Both bills are being held for further study.
 Driver protections

JC Muhammad, 57, has been a rideshare driver in and around Chicago since about 2016.
Now, he works full-time as an organizer for faith-based organizations and groups that support rideshare drivers, including The People’s Union, a membership-driven organization aimed at supporting workers in the city.
Muhammad was attacked by a passenger during a Lyft ride in 2022, he said. The passenger asked to borrow Muhammad’s phone and opened its Cash App. The passenger also hit him over the head twice, he said, and threw a brick at his car, denting the side.
“I was angry as hell,” Muhammad said. “I really wanted to engage the kid, but I said, ‘No, let me get back in my car.’”
After sharing the incident with Lyft, the company responded by saying it would not match him with that passenger again. But the person who rode with Muhammad did not match the profile of the person who originally requested the ride, he said.
Muhammad also said he couldn’t go to the police because he did not know the identity of the person who was in his car — and Lyft would not share the identity of the account holder who ordered the Lyft.
Uber and Lyft customers have the option to verify their account, but not everyone does, Muhammad said.
“That gives us some measure of comfort, but it really doesn’t do enough, especially when it comes to calling rides for other people,” Muhammad said. “The account holder may not be the actual passenger.”
Rideshare drivers across the country — especially those of color — are frequently harassed, according to a 2023 report from the Strategic Organizing Center. The center is a coalition of labor unions representing more than 2.5 million workers across the country.
The survey of over 900 app-based rideshare drivers found the majority had been verbally abused and more than a quarter of respondents were threatened with physical harm. Nearly 15% of the drivers were grabbed, groped or hit, according to the report.
There have been several incidents in Chicago where drivers are lured by a false account to a location where they are then robbed or attacked, said Deana Rutherford, the communications manager at the Chicago Gig Alliance, a subset of The People’s Lobby.
“These drivers just show up and they have no idea who’s about to get into their car,” Rutherford said. “And Uber doesn’t know who they are either.”
To address some of the safety and labor issues drivers were facing, the Chicago City Council began considering an ordinance backed by The People’s Lobby that would require passenger verification.
If passed, the ordinance would have also set a minimum wage for drivers, require companies to be more transparent about fares, have them disclose the details of driver account deactivations and more. Both Uber and Lyft initially opposed the ordinance. Uber warned the measure’s sponsor that the changes in pay rates would drive up costs for customers and force the company to cut 10,000 drivers, according to a letter Uber sent to a city alderman that was obtained by Stateline.
But Uber this week agreed to a deal that scraps Chicago’s ordinance in exchange for the company’s support for state legislation that would allow rideshare drivers to unionize, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida International University was the highest performing public university in Florida in 2025 based on the state’s incentivized funding model. 
FIU scored a 96 out of 100 on the performance-based model, which scores on metrics like wages of its graduates, their employment, graduation, and retention rates, and degrees awarded in areas in need.
The school scored a 96 in 2024 and 95 the year before. 
The lowest-scoring school was Florida Gulf Coast University. That school scored a 67, up from 63 a year ago. 
The funding attached to performance was not finalized during the Board of Governors meeting in Boca Raton Wednesday, due to the delayed end of the legislative session. The pot approved by the Legislature provides $350 million to be divided between campuses. 
Last year’s pot contained more than $300 million, with shares ranging from $71 million for the University of Florida to $5.1 million at New College of Florida.


Overall rankings:
2025 score (change from 2024 score)
Florida International University: 96 (No change)
University of Florida: 94 (+2)
Florida State University: 91 (+2)
University of West Florida: 91 (+7)
University of South Florida: 89 (No change)
University of Central Florida: 87 (+2)
Florida A&M University: 83 (+11)
University of North Florida: 81 (+5)
New College of Florida: 80 (+9)
Florida Atlantic University: 76 (-8)
Florida Polytechnic University: 74 (No change)
Florida Gulf Coast University: 67 (+4)


FGCU in September will have to present a student success plan due to it score being below 70. The plan must detail activities taken to improve metrics. This happened last year, too, and makes the school eligible for only 50% of its allocation after it presents the plan. 
FGCU President Aysegul Timur said the school is “laser focused” and she has “a completely new team working on the initiatives.”
Florida Atlantic University is on the “watchlist,” which means its score dropped. 
New College finances
One of the performance-based funding metrics tracks the cost to the student by calculating tuition. 
Board member Eric Silagy suggested updating the metrics, saying some are “layups” and easily attainable. 
Earlier in the meeting, Silagy called for closer attention to how much it costs each university to educate students. 
He has raised concern several times about New College of Florida’s cost to graduate a student. 
According to data the Phoenix received in a public records request from the Board of Governors, based on 2025-2026 estimations, it will cost the institution $555,016 to graduate a student from New College of Florida. The system-wide average is $54,391. The next closest to New College is Florida Polytechnic University at $154,149.
Silagy questioned, without mentioning New College, whether it is justified for the state to pay $450,000 for a student to graduate with a degree that is “arguably lesser of a degree given the status of preeminence” at other universities. 
Since Richard Corcoran started his presidency in 2023, the cost to graduate a student at New College has increased by $165,513, while the system-wide average has increased by $11,656 in the same time, based on the 2025-2026 estimation provided by the BOG. 
The school with the lowest estimated cost-to-the-state per degree in the coming year is University of Central Florida at $31,764. 
New College of Florida has the lowest projected enrollment in the coming year while UCF has the highest.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The U.S. Supreme Court, in a potential landmark decision, upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
Conservative justices lean toward allowing Tennessee’s ban on gender affirming care

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,'” Johnson said in a statement.
How to stay or when to move? Transgender laws force tough choices on Tennessee families

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.” 
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

(Photo by Tom Werner/Getty Images)North Carolina is one of states with the most improved health care systems, a national research and policy group concluded in a new report.  
North Carolina was the top state among a dozen of its neighbors in the southeast for people receiving the right health care at the right time and being able to avoid hospital stays and emergency department visits by receiving timely care, according to a Commonwealth Fund report released Wednesday. 
The report measured the differences in health and access to health care between low-income people and people with higher incomes. On that measure, North Carolina ranked 10th among the 12 southeastern states and 43rd in the nation. The state ranks slightly below the national average in overall performance, according to the report. 
The Commonwealth Fund releases a report each year ranking states’ health care systems and the health of their residents. This year, it ranked states on 50 measures such as rates of insurance coverage, out of pocket medical expenses, and premature deaths from preventable causes. Most of the data used for this year’s report is from 2023, before Medicaid expansion fully kicked in in North Carolina and provided more than 600,000 low-income adults with health insurance.  
The Affordable Care Act provided both subsidized health insurance and the chance for states to expand Medicaid by enrolling more low-income adults without dependent children in the government insurance plan. 
Since the ACA was enacted, fewer adults report that costs kept them from seeing a doctor. 
The percentage of North Carolina adults who reported that there was a time in the previous 12 months that they didn’t go to the doctor when they needed to because they couldn’t afford it dropped from 18.5% in 2013 to 10.8% in 2023. The national average in 2023, excluding Pennsylvania and Kentucky for which there is no data, was 11.7%.
“Every state saw a reduction in their number of uninsured adults in the last decade,” David Radley, senior scientist at the Commonwealth Fund, said in a video conference call with reporters Tuesday. 
“The coverage gains can largely be attributed to the Affordable Care Act that made Medicaid available to more people and that helped many low- and middle-income people afford the cost of health coverage purchased from federal and state-run health insurance marketplaces. Not only did these provisions help more people get coverage, fewer people skipped getting care that they needed because of its cost,” he said. 
These gains are threatened by proposed federal Medicaid cuts and coming increases to marketplace insurance costs, the report said.  
Congressional Republicans have plans to impose work requirements on Medicaid enrollees as a way to reduce costs. 
In their limited use in other states, Medicaid work requirements did not lead to increased employment. Rather, people who were working lost their health insurance because they had trouble documenting their work hours or because they didn’t know about the need to do it. 
Implementing work requirements will come with substantial administrative costs, said Sara Collins, senior scholar at the Commonwealth Fund. 
“The irony of these changes is that most people who will be impacted are already working,” she said. “The reporting requirements will be the thing that really does lead to people disenrolling and becoming uninsured.”
Additionally, federal measures enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic that reduced premiums for people who purchase insurance through an ACA marketplace are set to expire at the end of the year. Millions of people are expected to drop their insurance coverage because they won’t be able to afford it.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mammogram-Getty-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 11:07:49.610030

After a two-day manhunt, Minnesota authorities arrested and charged 57-year-old Vance Boelter on June 15, 2025, after he allegedly shot and killed Minnesota House Democratic leader Melissa Hortman and her husband in their home and seriously injured another state senator and his wife.
Boelter, disguised as a police officer, went to other Minnesota politicians’ homes late in the evening on June 13. In his parked car he left behind a list of names and addresses of other Minnesota state and federal elected officials, as well as community leaders and Planned Parenthood locations.
This incident is the latest to demonstrate how political and often hate-based violence is becoming a more common part of American politics.
“Let me be absolutely clear: this was an act of targeted political violence, and it was an attack on everything we stand for as a democracy,” U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in a June 14 statement. 
The threat of domestic violence and terrorism is high in the United States – especially the danger posed by white power extremists, many of whom believe white people are being “replaced” by people of color.
I am a scholar of political violence and extremism and wrote about these beliefs in a 2021 book, “It Can Happen Here: White Power and the Rising Threat of Genocide in the US.” I think it’s important to understand the lessons that can be learned from events such as the recent Minnesota shootings.
After decades of research on numerous attacks that have left scores dead, we have learned that extremists are almost always part of a pack, not lone wolves. But the myth of the lone wolf shooter remains tenacious, reappearing in media coverage after almost every mass shooting or act of far-right extremist violence. Because this myth misdirects people from the actual causes of extremist violence, it impedes society’s ability to prevent attacks.
 The lone wolf extremist myth is dangerous

FBI Director Christopher Wray said in August 2022 that the nation’s top threat comes from far-right extremist “lone actors” – who, he explained, work alone, instead of “as part of a large group.”
Wray is wrong, and the myth of the lone wolf extremist – the mistaken idea that violent extremists largely act alone – continues to directly inform research, law enforcement and the popular imagination.
I think that Wray’s focus on extremism is much needed and long overdue. However, his line of thinking is dangerous and misleading. By focusing on individuals or small groups, it overlooks broader networks and long-term dangers and so can impede efforts to combat far-right extremist violence – which Wray has singled out as the country’s most lethal domestic threat.
 Not a new trend

Far-right extremists may physically carry out an attack alone or as part of a small group of people, but they are almost always networked and identify with larger groups and causes.
This was true long before the social media age. Take Timothy McVeigh. He is often depicted as the archetypal lone wolf madman who blew up the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995.
In fact, McVeigh was part of a pack. He had accomplices and was connected across the far-right extremist landscape.
The same is true of Payton Gendron, who shot and killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store in 2022, and Patrick Crusius, who killed 23 people in a racist attack targeting Latino shoppers at a Walmart in Texas in 2019.
These two shooters were also characterized in media coverage as lone wolves following their deadly attacks.
“He talked about how he didn’t like school because he didn’t have friends. He would say he was lonely,” a classmate of Gendron said shortly after Gendron carried out the mass shooting.
Both were active on far-right extremist social media platforms and posted manifestos before their attacks. Gendron’s manifesto discusses how he was radicalized on the dark web and inspired to attack after watching videos of Brenton Tarrant’s 2019 massacre of 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.
Almost a quarter of Gendron’s manifesto is directly taken from Tarrant’s, which was titled “The Great Replacement.” This fear of white replacement, centered around perceived white demographic decline, was also a motive for Crusius. His manifesto pays homage to Tarrant, before explaining his attack was “a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”
The lone wolf myth also suggests that extremists are abnormal deviants with anti-social personalities.
After Gendron’s rampage, for example, New York Attorney General Letitia James called him a “sick, demented individual.” Crusius, in turn, was described by the White House and news articles as “evil,” “psychotic” and an “anti-social loner.”
The vast majority of far-right extremists are, in fact, otherwise ordinary men and women. They live in rural areas, suburbs and cities. They are students and working professionals. And they believe their extremist cause is justified. This point was illustrated by the spectrum of participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.
Boelter is a father of five who has worked various jobs in the food industry and with funeral service companies and a security service. While Boelter’s exact motivation and political affiliation are not clear, friends describe him as very religious and conservative. Boelter reportedly told a roommate and friend that he strongly opposes abortion. He has also criticized gay and transgender people during sermons he delivered at a church in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
 Tracing the lone wolf mythology

How did the lone-wolf metaphor come to misinform the public’s view of extremists, and why is it so tenacious?
Part of the answer is linked to white supremacist Louis Beam, who wrote the essay “Leaderless Resistance” in 1983. In it, he called for far-right extremists to act individually or in small groups that couldn’t be traced up a chain of command. According to his lawyer, McVeigh was one of those influenced by Beam’s call.
After Beam formulated this idea, both far-right extremists and law enforcement increasingly used the lone wolf term. In 1998, the FBI even mounted an “Operation Lone Wolf” to investigate a West Coast white supremacist cell.
The 9/11 terrorist attacks further turned U.S. attention to Islamic militant “lone wolves.” A decade later, the term became mainstream.
And so it was not a surprise when, after the Buffalo shooting, New York State Senator James Sanders said, “Although this is probably a lone-wolf incident, this is not the first mass shooting we have seen, and sadly it will not be the last.”
The tenacity of the lone wolf myth has several sources. It’s convenient – evocative and powerful enough to draw and keep people’s attention.
By using this term, which individualizes extremism, law enforcement officials may also depoliticize their work. Instead of focusing on movements like white nationalism that have sympathizers in the various levels of government, from sheriffs to senators, they focus on individuals.
The lone wolf extremist myth diverts from what should be the focus of deterrence efforts: understanding how far-right extremists network, organize and, as the Jan. 6 insurrection showed, build coalitions across diverse groups, especially through the use of social media.
Such understanding provides a basis for developing long-term strategies to prevent extremists like Boelter from carrying out more violent attacks.

(Photo by Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)The brain-dead pregnant woman who became a flashpoint in the national debate over reproductive rights and Georgia’s six-week abortion ban has delivered her baby, her family has announced.
Doctors told the family of 30-year-old mother and nurse Adriana Smith she had no chance of recovery after a series of blood clots in her brain left her brain dead in mid February, when she was about two months pregnant. Smith has been kept on life support since then to support the pregnancy.
The baby, Chance, was delivered Friday by emergency cesarean section and taken to the neonatal intensive care unit. Smith’s mother, April Newkirk, told 11Alive News the child was born prematurely weighing one pound 13 ounces.
Newkirk said she is calling for prayers for her grandson’s safety and health.
“Right now, we don’t know everything, because it’s so early. So they can’t tell everything,” she said. “Prayer changes things. And we just hope and pray that he’s OK.”
Newkirk told 11Alive that her daughter would be taken off life support Tuesday afternoon.
Smith became a flashpoint in the debate over reproductive rights and Georgia’s six-week abortion ban after family told news outlets that doctors told them that while she had no chance of recovery, Smith’s organs would be kept functioning so as not to violate Georgia law.
Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr has said the law does not require such action.
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” he said in an earlier statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy.’”
Newkirk said she is frustrated that Smith sought care for the blood clots that would go on to take her life. She said her daughter was released from the hospital without proper testing.
“All women should have a choice about their bodies. And I think I want people to know that [Adriana] was a nurse, an RN. The same field that she worked in is the same people who failed her. Can you understand what I’m saying? They didn’t go that extra mile, Not even that extra mile. They didn’t even do a CT scan on her. That would have detected it.”
Newkirk was on hand Sunday along with other family members and supporters gathered for a somber celebration of Smith’s 31st birthday at Park Avenue Baptist Church in Atlanta.
Several dozen people sang happy birthday and released white balloons into the sky. Smith’s mother helped serve slices of pink strawberry cake in the sanctuary as children laughed and shrieked in play behind the pews.
Smith’s family did not speak to the press and did not mention Chance’s birth at the time, but organizers invited members of the media to a rally in the church sanctuary following the private event.
Well-wishers and activists warded away the Georgia heat with “Black Lives Matter” fans as health care and abortion rights advocates spoke in front of an altar stacked with sunflowers and yellow and white roses between pillars of blue and pink birthday balloons.
Among them was Allison Coffman, executive director of the Amplify Georgia Collaborative, a reproductive rights group.
“Adriana Smith did not mean to die. She knew something was wrong, and she went to the hospital, and she was denied care,” Coffman said. “Unfortunately, this is not a unique story. Pregnant people across Georgia are receiving denied, delayed, and distorted care.”

(Kevin Hardy/Stateline)TOPEKA — Kansas farm income in 2025 is expected to be among the strongest in the last 20 years, bolstered by $2 billion in government payments for depressed crop prices and weather conditions, an agricultural economics expert said Tuesday.
“If you look at the inflation-adjusted farm income for 2025, it’s by far the largest we’ve seen in several years,” said Jennifer Ifft, professor and extension specialist in agricultural policy at Kansas State University. “What drove that sharp increase that we see from 2024 to 2025? The answer is government payments.”
Ifft spoke at a webinar about the outlook for farm income in Kansas and nationally, based on a report from the Rural and Farm Finance Policy Analysis Center at the University of Missouri and Kansas State University’s Department of Agricultural Economics.
Crop and livestock farmers face opposite market conditions, as livestock farmers are thriving amid strong demand while crop farmers face lower prices and high input costs, Ifft said. 
“We’ve seen an increase of over $5 billion in livestock receipts since 2020,” she said. “On the crop side, you have seen a decline in crop receipts since 2020. These numbers are very much moving in opposite directions, even though crops have leveled off a little bit.”
Crop receipts fell about $1.6 billion from 2020 to 2025, according to a chart Ifft shared. Data in 2025 is projected. 
“Somebody recently reminded me that there’s never been a year when all farms are doing well, and I think that’s especially true this year, and it’s especially important to look under the hood to understand what’s happening with these numbers,” Ifft said.
Although crop farm expenses have decreased, they are still high compared to previous years, she said.
“In 2015, fertilizer expenses have come down, but they’re still 28% higher than the long-run average,” Ifft said. “Pesticides … have come down in 2025, and they’re still 30% higher than that long-run average.”
The long-run average was determined from fertilizer and pesticide expenses from 2006 to 2024. 
Ifft highlighted government payments made in recent years, including during the first Trump administration after trade tariffs affected sales; in 2020-2021 related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and those approved at the end of 2024 that will be paid this year related to economic losses for some crop farms and disaster payments.

Gregg Ibendahl, K-State associate professor of agricultural economics, shared data that narrowed Kansas numbers down to a farm level, using information collected from farmers who are part of the Kansas Farm Management Association. 
He noted that in 2024, without government payments, about half of Kansas farms in his data would have lost money. 
Ibendahl said the current global situation affects farm income projections. 
“Some other issues to maybe think about or worry about, is what’s going to happen with the oil supply,” he said, adding that there are wars involving two of the biggest areas in the world where oil is produced, Russia and Ukraine, and now the Middle East conflict between Israel and Iran. 
“Surprisingly, though, with the fact that we have two major conflicts going on in two of the major oil-producing areas of the world, oil is still in the $70 range,” Ibendahl said. “I don’t know if the traders are being a little optimistic. They kind of got burned a little bit when the Ukraine war first started, because they had jacked up oil prices into about the $130 range. Turns out that it really didn’t affect Russia’s ability to produce oil.”
If oil prices would escalate quickly, it would affect diesel and fertilizer prices, he said.
 
National outlook
Kansas parallels what is happening across the country. 
“The bottom line at the national level is that we are seeing short- and medium-term pain for field crops because of lower prices, sticky costs,” said Alejandro Plastina, director of the Rural and Farm Finance Policy Analysis Center. “In the cattle sector, I would say the picture is better. There are limited supplies, mostly on beef and cattle production, high prices and lower feed costs than in the past, still high, but lower than the past.”
Plastina said government payments, specifically ad hoc payments made based on need to address situations such as weather events, were important in 2023 and 2024. 
“At the aggregate level, we are projecting higher net farm income in 2025,” he said. “But there’s a lot of uncertainty regarding the impact of tariffs and trades, whether we will have a farm bill this year, reconciliation and what it will look like, and then what’s next? That’s a big question for us.”
Like Ifft, Plastina said government support from 2023 and 2024 being paid out this year will increase net farm income. 
“In the absence of another round of big ad hoc, direct government payments in 2026, which there’s no sign or signal at this point that they might occur —  without those payments, net farm income would decline by 20% in 2026 to be barely above what we have as an estimate for 2024,” he said. 
Of the $41 billion in net farm increase predicted in 2025, $33 billion of it is in government payments, Plastina said. 
“Net farm income is up for one time in 2025 for those who will receive the payments, but managing that cash flow generated in 2025 to cushion the drop in margins going forward, I think will be critical for the ag sector,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-P5200090-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-18 11:07:49.610030

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa House of Representatives Tuesday secured the necessary two-thirds majority on a petition calling for a special session to override the governor’s veto of a bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines.
Seventy representatives signed the petition in favor of returning to the state Capitol to override the veto on House File 639, but two-thirds of the Senate will also have to sign on for a special session to be called.
House Speaker Pat Grassley called for the petition immediately following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ veto of HF 639, which would have restricted the use of eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines and added a slew of additional requirements for pipelines and the regulator.
South Dakota regulators deny carbon pipeline permit again, but company vows to reapply

“This veto was a major setback for Iowa landowners and the tireless efforts of the House to safeguard property rights,” Grassley said in a press release Tuesday. “With 70 members of the House standing united, we’ve met the constitutional threshold to move forward. We now call on our colleagues in the Senate to join us by securing the necessary signatures so we can convene a special session, override this veto, and deliver the protections Iowa landowners deserve against eminent domain for private gain.”
Members of the House have pushed forward similar bills over the past several years. The 2025 session was the first time the Senate took up the issue, but only after a group of 12 Republican senators said they would not vote on budget bills until HF 639 was debated.
The bill is tied to opposition of the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline which was granted a permit, and the right of eminent domain, by the Iowa Utilities Commission in June 2024. Landowners opposed to the pipeline feel the privately owned project should not have the power of condemnation and fear the impact of the pipeline on their land. The five-state pipeline would also pass through South Dakota, which has twice denied a permit for the project and has passed a law banning eminent domain for carbon pipelines.
The pipeline would connect to biorefineries and transport captured carbon dioxide to underground storage in North Dakota. This would give ethanol facilities and corn farmers access to the ultra-low carbon fuel market, which industry leaders say is needed to fuel the agricultural economy in the state.
The debate on the issue, and HF 639 in particular, has created rifts within the  Republican Party of Iowa, with those in favor of the bill alleging their colleagues, including Reynolds, abandoned GOP values.
Those against the bill said it reached beyond its intended targets and would have caused unintended consequences to agricultural and energy infrastructure in Iowa.
A press release from Iowa House Republicans about the petition said Reynolds’ veto denied “critical protections” against eminent domain, was an “undermining” of years of legislative efforts and represented a “significant setback” for those who have fought for “fair treatment” in carbon capture projects.
House Republicans also urged the Senate to “act swiftly” to meet the petition requirements to call a special session.
Senate Republican leadership did not respond to requests for comment on the latest news, but Sen. Jack Whitver, R-Grimes, said last week the majority of his caucus would “not be interested” in pursuing a special session override.
Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, who was one of the 12 holdouts on the Senate floor for debate on the bill, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Of the 30 representatives who did not sign the petition, 10 were Republicans and 20 were Democrats.

Joseph Gallant—a talented actor, musician, and standout student at Hartford High School—was both humbled and amazed to receive a generous college scholarship. Grateful for his family and the opportunities high school has brought him, he now looks ahead to his next “casting call”: college, nursing school, and a future dedicated to caring for others.
Read the[...]","When Joseph Gallant, a senior at Hartford High School, passed his Licensed Nursing Assistant exam this spring, his LNA course and exam fee were covered by a scholarship from the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation. The foundation also offered a college scholarship, and when some of his teachers and counselors suggested he apply, Joseph decided to go for it. But he wasn’t prepared for the response he received a month later. 
“I was just shocked,” Joseph says. “I didn’t think it was real.”
Joseph received a substantial scholarship that will cover most of his four-year tuition at Colby-Sawyer College, where he’ll enroll this fall to study nursing. The award means that he will have zero debt coming out of college.  
Beth Clay, who has advised Joseph on the college process for the last three years through VSAC’s Talent Search, a program that helps students explore and enroll in career and postsecondary education options, remembers that day well. “When Joseph sent me the screen shot about his scholarship award and asked if it was real, I responded immediately with ‘Of course it is! You’ve worked hard to make this a reality!’ But he was stunned. He actually called the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation to follow up and make sure it wasn’t a typo.”  
“I was sure they had put in an extra zero, or that it was supposed to go to another person. I didn’t believe that it could be mine,” Joseph recalls. “I was just blown away.”
Inspired by his grandparents
Growing up, Joseph always imagined he would go to college—a goal inspired by his maternal grandfather. “My Papa’s biggest thing is education,” says Joseph. “He wasn’t able to go to college himself, but he always believed that college helps you grow as a person and sets you up for a richer life experience, even if you don’t get a job in the field you go for. I also believe that education can carry us forward, whether that’s college or trade school. But having that traditional college experience—I just really wanted that, and I think that started with him.”
While family is the first thing Joseph talks about when he introduces himself—beginning his story with his gratitude for his entire family, from his mom and dad to his two younger siblings to his cousins—his grandparents have been his guiding force. 
“While I always had my mom and dad, I have an especially strong connection with my grandparents. They taught me how to hold myself accountable and how to be a good person, and that set the basis for my connection with others throughout my life.”
Joseph and his siblings lived with their Mimi and Papa in Quechee until Joseph was seven, when they moved to their house in White River Junction. His family still has dinner with Mimi and Papa once a week, and he’s also very close with his paternal grandparents. “Grandpa was a state forester for a long time, and I love spending time in the woods with him. And Grandma, who passed away last year, sparked my passion for music and theater. She was such a big part of my life.”
Joseph’s grandmother took him to frequent performances at Northern Stage in Hartford and made an introduction that kept him going during COVID, when school performances were put on hold. She introduced Joseph to Eric Love, a now-New York City-based actor who was the Associate Artistic Director for Northern Stage. Love and his directorial team had written a play, Stories of White River Junction, based on caricatures of people in town. Joseph and other young actors went out into the community to research their parts and perform the play at several local schools when the worst of the pandemic started to subside. 
Joseph has been in every school play offered at Hartford. He has also acted in local productions of Heathers and Hello Dolly with Trumbull Hall Troupe (a teen and tween theater group), and North Country Community Theatre. 
So many ways to help people
When asked how he became interested in nursing, Joseph explains that also started with family. “I have two aunts who work in the field, and seeing the fulfillment they get from their work, and hearing the stories they tell, really inspired me. The fact that you can go into a situation where someone is having one of the worst days of their life, and bring up their spirits even a little bit, is wonderful.” 
When he was able to enroll in the health sciences program at Hartford Area Career Tech Center, his classes and co-op experiences at the hospital and a nearby nursing home solidified his interest. “I like the flexibility; there are so many avenues to take and so many ways to go. I could travel the country or the world, or stay in one place, and I can help so many different types of people,” he says. 
While Joseph is excited about his future nursing career, he also struggled a bit with the inherent uncertainty of planning one’s future at age 17. He says the advice he received in that area was one of the most helpful things he took away from his participation in the VSAC Talent Search program and his weekly meetings with his Outreach Counselor, Beth Clay. “She assured me that if I ever decide that I don’t want to do nursing, it’s okay to explore other possibilities,” says Joseph. 
Despite his understandable concerns, Joseph’s strong interest in biology—he signed up for AP Bio his sophomore year because he was so excited to take it, he recalls—gave Beth a lot to work with as she helped Joseph turn his interests into a penciled-in path for college and career. 
“Beth helped me figure out what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go, and what I needed to do to set myself up for that. I would have struggled without her.”
Beth recommended Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire, a school with a strong nursing program about 35 minutes away from Joseph’s home. “I actually hadn’t heard of it, but when Beth told me about it, I thought, ‘Wow, this sounds great.’ I don’t usually make decisions emotionally, but when I visited, it just felt right. I remember thinking, ‘This place is great. These people seem awesome. I’d love to be a part of whatever community I can find here.’” 
Winning—and losing—with grace
Joseph has experienced some big wins during his high school career, from the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation scholarship, to a statewide medical math competition at a HOSA Future Health Professionals conference this spring, to countless auditions for plays and musical groups. Joseph has been a part of school concert choirs since the fourth grade, has played the alto saxophone in the school band since the fifth grade, and, in the last year, he joined the high school jazz band for an additional challenge. He especially loved participating in the annual Tri-Town Jazz Night, where the high school bands from Hanover, Lebanon and Hartford all play together.
“I love it all. From festivals to competitions, music has given me opportunities to play and audition both individually and as part of a community. Music is such a great way to connect with others and with yourself. And while it’s exciting to win or get the part, the effort also teaches you how to lose with grace.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Sophie and Colin Hortman, the children of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, issued a statement Monday calling on people to honor their parents’ legacy by doing “something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.”
The Hortman children are grieving following the Saturday killing of their parents, in what has been called a political assassination. Rep. Melissa Hortman was a longtime Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator beloved around the Capitol even as she scored major legislative victories.
“We are devastated and heartbroken at the loss of our parents, Melissa and Mark. They were the bright lights at the center of our lives, and we can’t believe they are gone. Their love for us was boundless. We miss them so much,” the release said. “We want everyone to know that we are both safe and with loved ones. We are grateful for the outpouring of love and support we have received, and we appreciate your respect for our family’s privacy as we grieve.”
The Hortman children thanked law enforcement for their efforts, which led to the arrest of suspect Vance Boelter on Sunday night. Boelter also wounded Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, though they are on a path to recovery.
The Hortman children emphasized the legacy that their parents will leave behind.
“Our parents touched so many lives, and they leave behind an incredible legacy of dedication to their community that will live on in us, their friends, their colleagues and co-workers, and every single person who knew and loved them,” the release said.
The Hortmans asked that people do an act of kindness in the memory of their parents’ commitment to service, sharing a list of suggestions.
“The best way to honor our parents’ memory is to do something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.”
They suggested planting a tree, telling a dad joke, and baking something to share — “bread for Mark or a cake for Melissa”.
“Pet a dog,” was on the list “A golden retriever is ideal but any will do.”
The Hortman family’s dog, a golden retriever named Gilbert, was euthanized after he was injured in the shooting. Hortman originally trained him as a service dog before he became a permanent member of the family.
Sophie and Colin Hortman ended the statement with a call to action.
“Hope and resilience are the enemy of fear. Our parents lived their lives with immense dedication to their fellow humans. This tragedy must become a moment for us to come together. Hold your loved ones a little closer. Love your neighbors. Treat each other with kindness and respect.”

Every summer, thousands of Vermonters and visitors gather on the lawn at Shelburne Museum to enjoy world-class music in one of the most iconic outdoor settings in the state.
Last year, for the first time, Waterbury, Vermont-based NOMAD powered the concert series entirely with clean battery energy storage, replacing diesel generators and helping to avoid nearly 4,500 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution.
This year, the Vermont Community Foundation is proud to step in as a key partner to make that impact possible once again. Thanks to philanthropic support from VCF, the 2025 Ben & Jerry’s Concerts on the Green at Shelburne Museum will continue as a fully net-zero event—powered entirely by NOMAD’s battery-based system.
“After two years of devastating flooding across the state, we know that climate resilience isn’t an abstract idea, it’s a daily reality for Vermont communities. Because of our fundholders’ partnership, VCF can step into the space between business, nonprofits, and government to accelerate Vermont-grown innovation and bring these solutions to a broader stage,” said Dan Smith, President & CEO of the Vermont Community Foundation. “NOMAD’s system—developed and deployed right here in Vermont—represents exactly the kind of local innovation the Community Foundation is proud to support.”
For concertgoers, that means the same incredible performances, without the noise, fumes, or carbon impact of traditional power sources. If you’ve been already, you know the scene. If you haven’t, picture families sprawled out on picnic blankets, kids dancing barefoot on the grass, and world-class music filling the air—all powered by silent, clean energy that lets the music take center stage.
“Live concerts require a lot of power and when you’re in a location without access to grid power, that historically required diesel generators,” said Alex Crothers, co-founder of Higher Ground. “Without the right resources, we’re often faced with difficult choices between what’s ideal and what’s feasible. Thanks to the support of the Vermont Community Foundation, we had the ability to choose a better path. This partnership is helping us cut emissions and demonstrate what outdoor concerts can look like.”
The VCF can support initiatives like the net-zero concert series thanks to the generosity and partnership of its fundholders. Each year, more than $70 million is put to work in communities across Vermont through grants, programs, and impact-focused investments—including over $20 million invested in Vermont businesses and organizations advancing renewable energy, affordable housing, and access to healthcare.
“Last year, when we realized we’d delivered 72 hours of clean power—from setup through encore—we wanted to understand the impact,” said Chris McKay, COO of NOMAD. “The numbers were eye-opening: avoiding nearly 4,500 pounds of CO₂, the equivalent of burning more than 2,000 pounds of coal. In just four concerts, we avoided the carbon sequestered by more than 2 acres of forest in a year. It showed us what’s possible when you replace diesel with real, local innovation.”
The 2025 Ben & Jerry’s Concerts on the Green at Shelburne Museum promises something special: world-class performances powered by local innovation and shared values. It’s a celebration of what we can do—together.
We hope to see you on the green.

(Overland Partners) Two Las Vegas residents are asking a Clark County District Court to halt the construction at Campus for Hope, a 20-acre campus backed by the gaming industry and expected to include 900 residential beds for the unhoused or those at risk of being homeless.
The lawsuit was filed Monday by James Root and Matthew Wambolt, who live less than a mile from the proposed development. They believe the campus will negatively affect their “quality of life, safety, and home values.”
“This isn’t about (being) anti-homeless,” Wambolt said during a press conference Tuesday. “This is simply about the state proving to the citizens and the taxpayers in this community that this is the right location for this proposed campus.”
Root and Wambolt are asking the court for an injunction on construction and to mandate “necessary and appropriate studies,” including looking at alternative locations.
The lawsuit was filed one week after Gov. Joe Lombardo signed a bill exempting the Campus for Hope from the oversight and involvement of the State Public Works Division. That bill, which was introduced during the last week of the legislative session, was pitched as a way to expedite the development of a much-needed project. But opponents see it as indicative of a troubling lack of transparency that has defined the project since day one.
Campus of Hope is expected to be located at 6161 W. Charleston Blvd, near Jones Boulevard, on what is currently known as the Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services campus. Expected to cost $200 million to stand up, the project will be funded by $100 million provided by the State of Nevada and $100 million privately fundraised by the Campus for Hope Foundation, a nonprofit that was established for this project and whose board is composed solely of gaming executives.
The lawsuit notes Campus for Hope will be located within two miles of 21 schools and numerous churches.
Along with the Campus for Hope nonprofit, the lawsuit names the State of Nevada, Clark County, the City of Las Vegas, and Las Vegas City Councilman Brian Knudsen as defendants. Knudsen represents the city ward where the campus is planned and participated in what Root described as a “contentious meeting” about the project earlier this year.
 Campus of Opacity

A lack of transparency has been a criticism of the Campus for Hope project from the start. The project’s first public pitch was on the third-to-last day of the 2023 Legislative Session, where a bill to greenlight and commit $100 million in public funds to the project was fast tracked by lawmakers. That bill was sponsored by Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a Democrat from Las Vegas.
Eighteen months later, in December 2024, Yeager and other lawmakers appeared to learn key details about the project for the first time during a meeting of the Interim Finance Committee, which handles money matters in between sessions. The issue only came up because the governor’s office needed IFC’s permission to reallocate funding for a project that was being canceled in favor of the Campus for Hope plan.
During that IFC meeting, several lawmakers raised concerns about the location.
The Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) approved Campus for Hope’s application to access the $100 million in public funds in January 2025.
Vaunted public-private partnership with resort industry has public footing 92% of ongoing costs

No public meeting or disclosure was required, but the Nevada Current reported the details of the application, which included plans for taxpayers to foot 92% of ongoing operational costs and plans to ask the state to deed them the land. (The latter plan appears to have been scrapped in favor of a long-term, $0 lease, which was approved by the state Board of Examiners last month and is up for approval by the IFC on Wednesday.)
The Current in February also reported that a youth behavioral health provider feared they would soon shutter because county and state officials had provided them no details on relocation.
In April, Campus for Hope President Kim Jefferies, Knudsen, and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill spoke with residents at a community meeting about the “transformational comment.” But the outreach, it appears, did not help.
 Campus of Hope responds

“Campus for Hope leadership has met all the state and local requirements for the construction of the facility,” reads an emailed statement provided to the Current by a spokesperson for the project. “We will continue to meet all those requirements, without exception.”
The nonprofit is “a partner to the community,” the statement continued. “We have held meetings, met with local businesses and nonprofits, and will continue to do so.”
Gov. Lombardo, who signed the 2023 bill greenlighting the campus and whose “chief innovation officer” is working on the project, has previously acknowledged the vocal group of residents opposed to the project. During an unrelated press conference last month, he referenced Campus for Hope and said he believed a lot of the “angst” from local residents comes down to “a lack of communication.”
Lombardo and the Campus for Hope spokesperson both noted that the existing mental health campus offers similar services as those planned for Campus for Hope, just not at the same scale.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-12.32.59 PM-1024x570.png,,,2025-06-18 10:02:54.038972

Southern New England, which includes Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, generally gets more total yearly precipitation than Seattle, even though Seattle is famous for its rainy days.
According to the National Weather Service, the mean annual precipitation in Seattle since 1970 was 38.01 inches, as recorded at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. By comparison, the Hartford area’s mean annual precipitation was 47.12 inches, the Boston area’s was 43.03 inches and the Providence area had a mean of 47.93 inches.
While Seattle experiences frequent light rain or drizzle spread out over many days, Connecticut gets heavier rainstorms, summer thunderstorms and winter snow that add to its total. This means that although Seattle has more rainy days, southern New England usually ends up with more overall moisture each year.
While Seattle had roughly 31 inches of precipitation in 2024, the Hartford area alone had nearly 46 inches.

(Photo courtesy WVUE-TV Fox 8)NEW ORLEANS – In the hours after a special investigations unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement led a raid on a construction site for a federally funded New Orleans drainage project, city officials began to sound the alarm that the worksite for one of its critical infrastructure projects had been hit.
On  May 27, agents raided the construction site for the Mirabeau Water Garden — a city stormwater management project in Gentilly, funded by a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that broke ground in late 2023 after years of delays. According to a release from ICE, agents arrested 15 workers at the site who were suspected of being in the country without proper documentation. Conflicting reports from a local immigrants’ rights group, Union Migrante, which monitors ICE actions around the city, placed the arrest count at about two dozen.
According to internal city of New Orleans emails obtained and reviewed by Verite News, shortly after the raid, LaNitrah Hasan, director of the city’s Project Delivery Unit, notified department heads managing major projects that federal immigration agents had arrested more than a dozen people at the site so they could “alert any contractors utilizing undocumented workers” about the raid.
At least one department director took heed. Michael Karam, head of the Department of Parks and Parkways, directed personnel in his department to let contractors know about the raid so that they could “take the appropriate precautions with their employees given that ICE is now actively working in the city and may be targeting other city sites.”
As President Donald Trump and his administration continue to fall short of a campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented immigrants during his second term, ICE has ramped up immigration enforcement efforts with raids at workplaces, a dramatic reversal from the Biden administration, which banned immigration authorities from conducting mass workplace arrests in 2021.
That includes construction sites, where workers of Hispanic and Latinx descent make up roughly 30% of the labor force nationally, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the same week that the drainage project was targeted, ICE agents raided the construction site of a large apartment complex in Tallahassee, Florida, arresting more than 100 workers. Construction experts say arrests that large essentially stall large scale projects.
The Trump administration has signalled that it will pull back — somewhat — on this approach to immigration enforcement. On Thursday, the Trump administration ordered a pause on work site raids for the farming, hospitality and food processing (like meat and seafood packing) industries, the New York Times reported. The order, however, did not mention construction sites. And on Sunday, Trump, speaking via social media, called on ICE to expand its efforts in large Democratically-run cities, though he did not mention New Orleans.
In an emailed statement sent to Verite News last week, city councilmember JP Morrell said he was “disturbed” by ICE’s raid at the Mirabeau Water Garden project.
“Arresting immigrant laborers who are working on crucial infrastructure projects to mitigate flooding is counterproductive, stupid and ridiculous,” Morrell said. “This [Trump Administration] seeks to breed fear in a community that is here to help and New Orleans will always be welcoming to anyone who chooses to call it home.”
The Water Garden, part of the $141 million Gentilly Resilience District, is just one of dozens of city construction projects in progress at the moment, including ongoing road and drainage work citywide through the Joint Infrastructure Recovery Request program — a  $2 billion project funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Contacted about concerns over major projects stalling due to potential future ICE raids, Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s communications staff referred Verite News to an official statement.
“The City of New Orleans is dedicated to keeping the Mirabeau Water Garden project on track and finishing on schedule by the end of this year,” the statement said. “The City will continue to work on projects that impact our community while addressing our changing climate and critical infrastructure needs.”
Hispanic residents of the city and surrounding areas, regardless of immigration status, remain concerned that they will be targeted, said Alejandra Vazquez, a local DJ who plays music and hosts karaoke parties in some of the area’s Latin American restaurants. She said before the start of Trump’s second term, the venues she played in were busy with dining customers, now only a few groups of people stay and eat.
“Every Spanish business here is going bad,” Vazquez said. “People [are] afraid to go to the stores. People [are] afraid to go and eat at the restaurants. They’re afraid to drive. They’re afraid to go and bring the kids to school.”
Vazquez, who is Mexican-American, provides alerts to the Latinx community in the New Orleans metro region through her Facebook page, Explosion Latina NOLA. She said she received calls about the raids minutes after federal immigration agents surrounded the Mirabeau Water Garden project.
ICE declined an interview request from Verite News and did not provide comment in response to questions.
A page on the ICE website about worksite raids says they are meant to reduce unlawful employment, hold employers accountable for hiring undocumented laborers and protect  “employment opportunities for the country’s lawful workforce.”
But, George Carillo, CEO of national think tank the Hispanic Construction Council, said immigrants in construction are adding to a workforce that is experiencing a shortage of roughly half a million workers.
“Across the country we are about 22% behind on [critical infrastructure] projects because we just don’t have the workforce,” Carrillo said in an interview with Verite News on Wednesday. “If we do this mass deportation of our undocumented immigrants, who’s gonna do the work? What happens to the way of life of the American people? … Where do we get our clean drinking water? How do we power our homes?”
Carrillo said targeting immigrant construction workers will cripple the construction industry.
“It doesn’t give the market confidence to want to develop more when it understands that it really does need its immigrant population in order to be able to continue to grow,” he said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska has launched an online reporting tool to gather information around local and federal law enforcement agencies increasing immigration enforcement actions around the state.
The civil rights group is seeking to monitor Alaska immigration enforcement actions, as the Trump administration has ramped up arrest quotas for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to 3,000 arrests per day, and deployed military forces to Los Angeles earlier this month to quell protests of ICE tactics, arrests and deportations. 
Cindy Woods is a senior immigration law and policy fellow with the ACLU of Alaska, one of the staff members monitoring the report tool, and coordinating legal resources. 
“There’s a lot of really concerning trends in relation to traffic stops and workplace raids and things like that happening in the Lower 48,” Woods said. “And so we both want to make sure that here in Alaska, folks aren’t living in unnecessary fear. But that also we do understand what enforcement is looking like here in Alaska, so that we can provide the most up to date and helpful information about individuals rights.”
The online form is confidential and currently available in English and Spanish, “and we’re working on getting it in other languages as well,” she said. The form asks for details on immigration enforcement actions, where they occurred, what law enforcement agencies were involved and others.
Woods said the ACLU can assist in locating an individual who has been arrested, “for folks who might also have had a loved one picked up and not know where they are,” she said. 
The ACLU is not representing immigration cases, she said, but the organization can connect people to immigration attorneys and legal resources as needed. 
There have been several ICE arrests in Alaska, including in Anchorage and Soldotna, and the Alaska Department of Corrections announced earlier this month the state is holding ICE detainees from out of state. 
Woods said that regardless of immigration status, civil or criminal charges, or where people were arrested — whether in Alaska or out of state — everyone has equal rights to due process, as their cases move through the courts. 
“Noncitizens have equal due process rights to citizens,” she said. “So the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution applies to noncitizens as well, regardless of their immigration status.” 
ICE has not responded to repeated requests for comment about why ICE detainees were transferred to Alaska, or what charges — civil or criminal — are being brought against the men now held at the Anchorage Correctional Complex.
Woods said the ACLU has spoken with several ICE detainees in the custody of the Department of Corrections and their attorneys representing them, and learned that some have no criminal charges, and some have previously been granted asylum. “And so while it’s not clear the criminal histories of each of these individuals, I can say with certainty that some of them do not have criminal histories, and some of them actually have been granted immigration relief by our immigration courts, and yet are still being detained,” she said.
Woods said the ACLU has concerns around the state’s standards of detention for ICE detainees, access to communications with attorneys and family members, translation services, as well as medical care. The ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Corrections in May challenging what they say is “inadequate, dangerous and inhumane” health care provided for incarcerated Alaskans, “for medical neglect and just the pretty abysmal medical treatment that folks in DOC custody receive,” Woods said. “And so we’re concerned about that.”
The Department of Law has not filed a response to the lawsuit yet.
The Alaska House Judiciary Committee is holding a fact-finding hearing on June 20 in Anchorage, to be streamed online on the Legislature’s website and on Gavel Alaska, to address many of these concerns. 
On Friday, a spokesperson with the Department of Corrections said DOC is using translation services, but on Monday declined to answer questions on conditions of detention, detainees’ access to communication with families and attorneys, as well as access to medical care, saying they would be addressed at the June 20 hearing.

(Photo provided by the SC Student Loan Corp.)Across the nation, headlines about federal student loan reforms are creating concern among families.
Recently, many parents and students have celebrated high school graduations and are thinking about attending colleges and universities this fall. Meanwhile, parents are worried about how their children will afford this education and repay loans.
While some welcome reform, others are asking: What does this mean for us?
We understand how unsettling these changes can be.
That’s why South Carolina Student Loan Corp.’s leadership has been actively engaging with elected representatives and government officials on Capitol Hill, as well as collaborating with industry experts and student loan lenders nationwide, to stay informed and effectively advocate for borrowers.
While we can’t predict what will happen, history shows that we’re ready to adapt.
For more than 50 years, South Carolina Student Loan Corp. has proudly served as the only lender of education loans based in the state.
In 2010, the U.S. Department of Education made changes to the federal loan program, which included taking the funding of certain loans back in-house. When that occurred, we adapted, and students and families were able to receive much-needed financial aid.
Today, we stand ready to adapt again to minimize disruption to students’ educational journeys.
What sets us apart as a student loan lender is our nonprofit mission and deep roots in South Carolina.
Created by the South Carolina General Assembly in 1973, we were intentionally designed from the start to serve students and families. We see educational lending as a long-term investment in our great state’s future.
Since our inception, we have provided more than 2 million loans to approximately 487,000 students and families, totaling $8.7 billion in student loan assistance. That averages to helping 9,500 South Carolinians each year pursue their education goals.
Because of our commitment to reinvesting our earnings into our products, not corporate profits, we can champion affordable, accessible education for all. That mission-driven difference continues to guide how we serve South Carolina families today in a time of potential federal student lending transition.
Recent challenges at the U.S. Department of Education have also shed light on the student loan system as a whole and present an opportunity for us to understand the system holistically.
Student lenders, like us, work alongside federal programs, stepping in to cover education expenses not fully met by federal aid, scholarships, or other funding sources.
However, we still encourage students to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and take advantage of federal grants and low-interest loan programs in the student’s name.
As lawmakers are considering changes to federal loan programs like Graduate PLUS or Parent PLUS loans, we are prepared to offer loans to help cover tuition, living costs, and other educational expenses to qualified borrowers.
Unlike the PLUS program, we do not charge any loan origination fees, resulting in additional savings to South Carolina families, which can be significant over the lifetime of the loan.
If local lenders become more heavily involved in financial aid processes, there could be a real benefit.
That’s because individual lenders have a deep understanding of their region’s unique educational and economic landscape, allowing them to guide students toward grants, scholarships, and affordable loan options aligned with local job markets.
And as a not-for-profit, South Carolina Student Loan can reinvest its dollars back into loan programs that support our students and strengthen our state with a strong workforce.
As always, our best advice for students is to start the application process in June. That way, no matter what happens, you have a plan.
Remember, loan amounts can always be reduced if needed. Qualifying unlocks your lending options; it’s not a binding commitment.
At South Carolina Student Loan Corp., we know that when we invest in our students, we invest in South Carolina’s future.
So, with so much uncertainty, we encourage our leaders and families to remember that supporting smart, state-driven solutions and investing in our students today builds a brighter, more prosperous South Carolina for generations to come.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SCSLC-Feature-Photo.jpg,,,2025-06-18 10:02:54.038972

However, Rice said those issues could remain on an upward trajectory if the Legislature prioritizes schools.
Only recently has the Legislature begun to address the years of underinvestment in Michigan schools, Rice told members of the state Senate Education Committee Tuesday. But the measures the legislature has enacted like new literacy and dyslexia testing and screening laws and the addition of 1,700 school health and safety professionals have already brought the state closer to the eight goals laid out in Michigan’s Top 10 Strategic Education Plan.
“In the last few years, Michigan has improved in a wide range of areas, some of which are at historic levels,” Rice said. “We certainly have quite a bit of room to continue to improve.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2024, Michigan saw a historic high in four-year high school graduation rates at 82.8%, which Rice said has been helped by rigorous secondary school program expansions that among other successes have resulted in the number of students enrolled in career and technical education, or CTE programs, going up 10% in the last three years.
As the state House and Senate will have to collaborate on marrying their separate proposals for K-12 school funding in the creation of the next state budget, Rice thanked the Senate for designating $85 million towards CTE programming in its proposal which he said will help bring programs that dramatically improve post-graduation employment opportunities to districts that need it the most.

The Senate plan also includes increasing the money schools receive per-pupil from $9,608 to $10,008, with half of that increase being mandated to increase teacher pay. 
Rice’s reception by lawmakers in the Democratic-led Senate Education committee Tuesday was far warmer than that of the Republican-led House Oversight Committee earlier this month, where lawmakers grilled Rice on the state’s bottom of the nation fourth grade reading scores.
In order to address the areas in need of improvement in schools, Rice asked senators to consider making Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling, or LETRS, training for reading mandatory for kindergarten through 5th grade teachers across the state. 
Rice is also calling for reducing class sizes in high-poverty areas during the first years of education in order to address learning gaps in communities in need of investment.
“I challenge any of you, and for that matter, any member of the Legislature, you go teach 33 young people in third grade,” Rice said. “Our class sizes are too high in early elementary.”
Addressing the mass flight from the education profession Michigan has seen in the last decade is a top priority in improving the health, safety and success of Michigan schools, Rice said.
A picture is worth a thousand words and the picture previous Governor Rick Snyder painted for the teaching profession shows how critical the state’s situation is, Rice said. In 2011, when Snyder, a Republican and staunch critic of public schools, came into office he signed a state budget that cut per-pupil spending by $470. 
Also, when Snyder came into office there were 23,000 young professionals in Michigan preparing for a career in teaching, Rice said. Five years later, as divestments in schools made teaching a less lucrative career, 9,500 students, less than half, were preparing for the teaching profession.

(Getty Images)If the state budget reflects New Hampshire’s values and priorities, the children of our state are in trouble. The current proposed 2025-2026 budget not only does not support our children, it may indeed harm them.  
The proposed budget does more than neglect the needs of vulnerable youth — it actively undermines the very systems designed to protect them. Most troubling among these changes are deep cuts to the Office of the Child Advocate (OCA), a vital safeguard created in 2017 after the tragic deaths of two young children who had been involved with the Division for Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF).  
In 2017, through bipartisan legislation, New Hampshire established the OCA to serve as an independent agency responsible for ensuring that the best interests of children in our child-serving systems are protected. Since then, the OCA has served as a confidential, trusted resource for families, providers, legislators, DCYF staff, and citizens to report concerns and demand accountability. It was designed to identify systemic failures before they cost lives. This ensures that critical issues are not overlooked or ignored. 
Now, fewer than 10 years later, we appear to be forgetting the lessons learned, in the hardest possible way.  
The OCA was never meant to be politically expedient — it was meant to be effective. Its core function is to independently review child-serving systems and promote transparency even when that transparency brings difficult issues to light or prompts uncomfortable discussions. The purpose is not to assign blame, but to learn from gaps and drive meaningful, positive change for children. Although honest scrutiny may be difficult, it is essential. Children cannot wait for political comfort. 
In 2023, the OCA uncovered disturbing abuse of New Hampshire children placed by DCYF in a Tennessee residential facility. This should have been a wake-up call to strengthen, not weaken, our child protection infrastructure. One critical policy response was the long-overdue recognition of the right to legal counsel for children in abuse and neglect cases who are at risk of, or placed in, a residential facility.  
Shockingly, New Hampshire is also one of only 13 states that do not guarantee the right to counsel for all children throughout abuse and neglect proceedings; and one of only six states that do not guarantee the right to counsel for children in abuse and neglect proceedings under any circumstances. Children involved in juvenile justice proceedings are granted legal representation. Children in need of services are, too. But children who have been abused or neglected by their parents and then removed from their home and community to a residential facility? The current budget proposal delays their right to counsel — leaving these vulnerable children without the basic protection of legal advocacy at a time when they need it most. 
Worse still, the Legislature is proposing cuts that would cripple the OCA’s ability to do its job. It would lose key positions and face new limitations on access to the information it needs to fulfill its legal responsibilities. And while the Senate has added language requiring the OCA to remain nonpartisan, the appointment of the child advocate is now solely in the governor’s hands — with no requirement for bipartisanship in that decision. Advocating for the best interests of children should not be a partisan issue.  
In just a few short years, New Hampshire seems to have forgotten why the Office of the Child Advocate was established and has backtracked on providing greater protection to our state’s most vulnerable children. The headlines of 2017 weren’t distant history — they were a warning. And while 32 other states have moved toward more robust, independent oversight of child welfare systems, New Hampshire is stepping backward.  
We must ask: What does it say about us that children removed from unsafe homes, placed in out-of-state facilities, or left voiceless in court are deemed less worthy of care than the institutions that failed them? 
The Office of the Child Advocate was created to prevent tragedy. Gutting it now is a decision we will come to regret — because history, when ignored, has a cruel way of repeating itself. 
New Hampshire, we have seen this story before. The tragedies that led to the establishment of the OCA were not that long ago. We were there, we saw the news headlines. Let’s not live through it again.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/youthriskbehaviorsurvey-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 10:02:54.038972

From CalMatters Capitol reporter Jeanne Kuang:
The California Senate voted this week to reverse course on the state’s calls for a constitutional convention, one of which many Democrats supported just two years ago at Gov. Gavin Newsom’s urging. 
With the President Donald Trump administration at the helm and Republicans running Congress, Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, said the state should err on the side of caution by revoking its past seven calls for a session to rewrite the Constitution. 
Congress can convene such a session if 34 states call for one — though it’s never actually happened before. California is one of 28 states with pending calls for a convention on the books, according to the nonpartisan Common Cause, and some Republicans nationally have pushed for one. Constitutional amendments require 38 states to ratify.
As currently written, the Constitution guarantees such bedrock American rights as free speech, equal protection of the laws and birthright citizenship. 

Wiener: “I shudder to think what (the Trump administration) would do to Californians’ basic rights if given the chance to rewrite the Constitution itself. There are no guardrails once a constitutional convention has been triggered … California must do its part to prevent this chaos.”

His resolution to revoke California’s calls passed the Senate on Monday with 27 votes in favor, including one Republican and 15 of the Democrats who previously supported holding a convention. The resolution heads next to the Assembly. If passed, it would rescind the seven pending calls from California, dating back to 1911, to amend the constitution on issues ranging from labor laws to campaign finance.
But to actually rescind the calls, lawmakers will need the support of Newsom — who pushed for the last constitutional rewrite resolution in 2023 as he positioned himself as a national leader on gun control. In 2023 he proposed a constitutional amendment to require a federal minimum age of 21 for firearm purchases, universal background checks, a waiting period between purchasing and receiving a gun and a ban on selling assault weapons. As CalMatters reported last year, those efforts have gone nowhere, with not a single other state having joined the call. 
Newsom’s office did not respond when asked whether he still supports a convention under the current presidential administration and Congress.

Trump calls LA deployment ‘unreviewable’

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals began its hearing Tuesday to determine whether to allow California National Guard troops to stay in L.A. under Trump’s command. In court the federal administration argued that the president, under certain conditions, has the power to commandeer the troops, and that the court does not have the authority to overrule him. One of his lawyers called the president’s deployment “unreviewable” by courts.
Before the proceedings kicked off, Newsom spoke with independent journalist Aaron Parnas, and said that the hearing was essentially “about federalism,” and that if the state is successful in its lawsuit, it “will be a big day in the rule of law.” 

Newsom: “This is about our Constitution. … That’s what ultimately is being tested here, and that’s the theory that Donald Trump can unilaterally decide to militarize the streets of America. Happens to be in L.A. now, will be in your city next.”

This past week California Republican lawmakers made use of the situation in L.A. as an opportunity to slam Democrats on immigration and crime, writes CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu. Stella asked all 29 GOP lawmakers — who are typically opposed to government overreach — whether they supported Trump’s mobilization of troops. Only six replied, all in support of Trump.

Assemblymember Jeff Gonzalez of Coachella: “When you have leaders that don’t step up, someone needs to step up, and that’s what took place.”

Prison guard union makes $600M deal with Newsom

A month after Newsom said he wanted concessions from public employee unions to help balance the state budget, the union representing California prison guards struck a new labor agreement that gives the governor some relief in the short-term, in exchange for some perks down the road.
As CalMatters’ Nigel Duara explains, the labor deal for the California Correctional Peace Officers Association includes a combination of raises and bonuses, such as two, 3% raises that take effect next month and July 2027, and a $10,000 retention bonus for officers at three prisons.
But the contract also saves the state money in some ways. The raise next month will be offset by a personal leave program that is expected to reduce pay by 3% in the coming year. It also defers the state’s contribution toward the health care coverage used in retirement.
In total, the agreement — which still needs legislative approval — is anticipated to cost the state $600 million over the next three years.

But this policy change would place a unique burden on California’s community colleges, which say that fraud represents less than 1% of the billions in aid that go to its students each year.

As of Wednesday morning, Hashmi remained the frontrunner in the contest, with 27.49% of 477,845 votes total. Her closest competitors were former Richmond mayor Levar Stoney, with 26.65%, and Aaron Rouse, a state senator representing Virginia Beach who earned 26.16%.

The election’s razor-thin margins set the stage for a possible recount, because Virginia law allows defeated candidates to request a recount if the margin of victory is 1% or less. Stoney has not conceded, while Rouse admitted the results of the race weren’t “what we’d hoped for” and congratulated Hashmi on her apparent win in a tweet.
“I’m honored to be our Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor,” Hashmi tweeted Tuesday evening. Shortly after, the Democratic Party of Virginia announced that its full slate of statewide candidates had been set, with former state delegate Jay Jones the party’s pick for attorney general and former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger running for governor. 
“With more than 480,000 ballots cast — including a record-breaking number during the early voting period — Virginians have made it clear: they are energized, engaged, and ready to elect Democrats up and down the ballot this November,” DPVA chair Lamont Bagby said in a statement Tuesday night. “With Abigail Spanberger, Ghazala Hashmi, and Jay Jones forming the statewide ticket, and a record-breaking slate of House of Delegates nominees, Democrats are united, focused, and ready to win.”
Hashmi has served in the state legislature for six years and is the Senate Education and Health committee chair and has advocated for progressive priorities including reproductive health care, k-12 public education and affordable housing. She is also a career educator, having served for 30 years as a professor at the University of Richmond and then Reynolds Community College. She immigrated to the United States from India with her mother and has lived in the Richmond area since 1991.

“I consider many of my colleagues across the aisle to be strong allies in the work to improve education outcomes and economic opportunities for the regions that they serve,” Hashmi said in an interview with the Mercury in the days leading up to the primary election, in which she framed herself as the most experienced legislator in the race and “uniquely qualified” to lead as lieutenant governor. 
“Although a few of the issues upon which the General Assembly focuses are partisan in nature, the majority are nonpartisan and impact the lives of families and communities.

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/06/california-glenn-county-hospital-critical-access-closure-medicaid/,"Glenn County's only hospital may be forced to close because a federal agency is removing its ""critical access"" designation. Patients would have longer waits for ambulances and longer drives for emergency care.","In summary
Glenn County’s only hospital may be forced to close because a federal agency is removing its “critical access” designation. Patients would have longer waits for ambulances and longer drives for emergency care.


A debate over roads may cost Glenn County its only emergency room. 
Glenn Medical Center, a 25-bed hospital in the rural agricultural town of Willows, north of Sacramento, is about to lose its “critical access” title. Without it, administrators say the hospital couldn’t afford to stay open because it would lose its increased Medicare reimbursements and regulatory flexibilities.
Glenn Medical Center received a letter in April from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services notifying the hospital that it was no longer in compliance with the distance requirement to qualify as “critical access.” That requirement states that hospitals must be more than a 35-mile drive on primary roads — or a 15-mile drive on mountainous or secondary roads — from the next nearest hospital.
The next closest hospital is Colusa Medical Center, which the federal Medicare and Medicaid agency places at 32 miles south of Glenn Medical Center. That makes Glenn County’s hospital three miles short of the qualifying distance for the critical access title. But local health officials and the Willows Fire Department say ambulances and most patients take the “more reliable” route of I-5 and Highway 20, which makes the distance between the hospitals 35.7 miles — far enough to qualify.
About 40% of Glenn County’s 30,000 residents rely on public health insurance programs — Medicaid and Medicare — and 12% live under the poverty line.
“We treat and see and care for a lot of people who are unseen in the community. A lot of behavioral health crises, a lot of justice-involved folks, a lot of elderly, a lot of people without transportation. And we are truly a lifeline for those folks,” said Lauren Still, chief administrative officer at Glenn Medical Center.

Closing the only hospital in this Sacramento Valley county would mean residents would have to travel farther for emergency care and ambulances would take longer responding to 911 calls.
Dr. Jared Garrison, Glenn County’s health officer, said losing the hospital would be a devastating blow to the community. Garrison worries about the elderly who may be afraid to drive at night and people who don’t have transportation to make it out of the county. Heart attacks, strokes, traumatic injuries and overdoses can become more deadly when hospital treatment is delayed.
“If Glenn Medical Center closes, it’s not just a health crisis — it’s an economic and social crisis,” Garrison said. “We’ll see longer emergency response times, job losses, declining local businesses, and worsening health outcomes for our most vulnerable neighbors.”
‘This is not the road people would take’
Both hospitals, Colusa and Glenn, have been at the same location since their construction decades ago. In 2001, Glenn Medical Center was first approved to participate in the federal Critical Access Hospital Program under the same distance rule. Hospital and county health officials say geographically nothing has changed. 
“We tried to send some emails back and forth and say, ‘Hey, this is not the road people would take. This is not the road the ambulance takes. This is just not accurate,’” Garrison said. The “shorter” route, he explained, actually takes longer because it includes a county road that often floods and is primarily used by farm equipment.
The hospital’s appeals to the federal agency have been unsuccessful. Still said she is clinging to one last hope that U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, a Richvale Republican, can make the hospital’s case.
Mark Spannagel, chief of staff at LaMalfa’s office, told CalMatters that no resolution has been reached yet, but that conversations with the federal agency continue and that the hospital’s situation is under “heightened review.”
The federal Medicare and Medicaid agency is supposed to review critical access hospitals’ eligibility periodically. This review started last year and the issue seems to be a reclassification of roads, Spannagel said.
The federal agency did not respond to a CalMatters request for comment about why it changed its decision on the roads.

Peggy Wheeler, vice president of policy at the California Hospital Association, said she is aware of four critical access hospitals in California that received a similar letter. Two of them, Bear Valley Community Hospital in Big Bear Lake and George L. Mee Memorial in Monterey County, have since resolved their cases and will be allowed to keep their “critical access” designation. 
A third, Santa Ynez Valley Cottage Hospital in Solvang is also working with the federal agency and considering its options, Wheeler said. The Cottage Health system declined an interview request from CalMatters. 
Wheeler explained that hospitals that lose their “critical access” designation may have to apply for other classifications, such as a “low volume provider” or “sole community hospital,” which also provide enhanced Medicare payments. 
In its letter, the federal agency told Glenn Medical Center that it has until April 23, 2026 to reclassify as another type of hospital to continue participating in the Medicare program.
A financial buffer for ‘critical access’ hospitals
The Clinton administration created the Critical Access Program in 1997 as a way to support rural hospitals. The goal of the program is to make sure that remote areas far from cities have adequate medical care.
“Our hospital was on the brink of closure back in 2001. We got this designation and have kept our doors open for the next 24 years,” said Still at Glenn Medical Center. The hospital is owned by American Advanced Management, the same group that recently purchased and reopened Madera Community Hospital. 
The program gives the hospital a bit of a financial buffer through higher-than-average Medicare reimbursement. Medicare pays critical access hospitals 101% of costs for most inpatient and outpatient services; for comparison, Medicare reimburses most other hospitals 82% of costs, according to the American Hospital Association. 
The designation also allows rural hospitals to stay open even if they don’t meet certain standards required of most other general acute hospitals. For example, Glenn Medical Center does not have a serviceable operating room, and bringing it up to required standards is financially prohibitive, Still said. 
The financial burden of losing its critical access designation would be such that the hospital would likely have to close its inpatient services by next spring, Still said. Outpatient services, such as clinics and labs, would remain open.
Like hospitals across the country, Glenn Medical Center is also bracing for a separate financial blow in the form of potential Medicaid cuts that are currently being debated in Congress. Hospitals could see decreased federal funding and increased costs because of uncompensated care from people who lose their Medicaid coverage. The American Hospital Association has estimated that rural hospitals across the country could lose about $50 billion altogether in federal Medicaid spending by 2034, if President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” were to pass as currently drafted.
Last month, all of California’s Republican House members voted in support of the budget bill, including La Malfa, who represents the area. The Senate is now deliberating on its own version of the bill. 
To raise awareness of the hospital’s looming loss of its critical access status, Glenn Medical Center recently launched a campaign urging residents to write testimonials and letters in support.
Without a local hospital, the county’s two ambulances would have to travel farther, to Enloe Medical Center in Chico, about 36 miles north. Garrison explained that ambulances would probably choose Enloe over Colusa Medical Center because it is the larger of the two and has a trauma center.
The vast central-north region between Mendocino and Plumas National Forests is already down a hospital after Adventist’s Feather River Hospital was damaged in the 2018 Camp Fire and did not reopen. 
If ambulances have to drive 45 minutes out of the county instead of the five to ten minutes to their local hospital, that will affect the ability of Emergency Medical Services to respond to 911 calls, Garrison said. 
“I was talking to an administrator at Enloe and they estimated that this could increase their wait times by up to two hours,” Garrison said.

California Republicans who agreed to speak with CalMatters endorse President Donald Trump’s military deployment in Los Angeles as necessary to save the state from its Democratic leadership. 


When is it OK for a president to use military forces on civilians in a state over the objections of their governor?
When that governor is Gavin Newsom, California Republican leaders say.
In a rare move, President Donald Trump overrode Newsom and local leaders in sending 4,000 National Guard members and 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests against the president’s immigration enforcement. 
California is challenging Trump’s order in federal court. While the president argues that he has the sole authority to deploy the military, legal scholars and judges have warned that the move risks intruding upon state sovereignty and tilting the constitutional balance of power between the federal and state governments.
But most California Republican lawmakers, who have vehemently opposed “government overreach,” would not say where they stand on Trump’s military intervention in Los Angeles. 
CalMatters asked all 29 Republican lawmakers in the state Legislature whether they support Trump’s troop deployment. Only six answered, and all sided with Trump. 
The Democrats had it coming, those lawmakers argued, because their lenient immigration and crime policies — including a 2017 state “sanctuary” law that limits local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents — forced Trump’s hand. 
“It is the root cause of the rioting and violence that we are witnessing this year,” state Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil of Modesto said of the sanctuary law in a video last week.
State Republicans also seized on sporadic violent clashes, captured in viral videos on social media, as proof of Newsom and other Democrats’ failure to rein in violence. The GOP lawmakers argued that’s why Trump had to step in, even though local police had said they did not need help from federal troops.
“What do you do when you have a governor who’s not leading (and) is not doing anything about unrest and violence in his own state?” said Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher of Chico.

But would the Republican lawmakers say the same if a Democratic president descended the military upon a red state over the head of its governor? Some said yes as others bit their tongues, arguing it should be judged on a case-by-case basis and refusing to entertain hypotheticals.
“It depends on the situation,” Gallagher told CalMatters. “What are the times when you can and when you can’t? That’s what the court’s going to decide.”
It’s no surprise that state Republicans are using the opportunity to slam Democrats on immigration and crime: Those strategies have worked for the minority party in the past. It’s also a chance for them to demonstrate their loyalty to Trump, who wields a definitive influence over the party. 
But it is particularly worrisome when Republicans are aligned with Trump in a move to override state authority, which tears at the fabric of the U.S. Constitution, said Eric Schickler, political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
“If you think about what the framers were worried about when they created the Constitution, it’s exactly this kind of dynamic,” he said. “It’s not an exaggeration to say the nature of the U.S. political system has changed. And it’s changed not just because of Trump’s force of will as an individual, but it’s changed because members of his party, when he’s asserted authority, have sided with him consistently.”
That alignment could cost Republicans in 2026, said Mike Madrid, a longtime GOP strategist and a vocal critic of Trump. Polling in recent weeks has shown that Trump’s immigration policies and military deployment in Los Angeles are growingly unpopular among Americans. 
“I don’t think people are seeing this as an immigration issue anymore. They are seeing it the way the governor has framed this, which is a constitutional issue, a federal overreach issue, a due process issue,” Madrid said. “That puts Republicans on very troubling ground.”
California GOP lawmakers: Trump ‘stepped up’
While Trump’s executive order told the troops to guard federal personnel and properties, he and his administration have also repeatedly suggested that the troops are there to crack down. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem last week even said the military was there to “liberate the city from the socialists.” 
The military presence has stoked fear among legal experts and some law enforcement officials, who argue there is no legal standing for Trump’s use of authority. Unleashing military forces on domestic protesters can also have a chilling effect, risk escalating the situation further and create confusion among civilians, they said. 
CalMatters also reached out to U.S. Reps. David Valadao, Young Kim and Ken Calvert, three Republicans who will likely face fierce challenges from Democrats in 2026. None of them responded.
While acknowledging California’s sovereignty, some state Republican lawmakers told CalMatters Trump needed to intervene due to what they perceived as a lack of leadership from Newsom. They cited videos of brick-throwing, Molotov-cocktail-tossing protesters and made unsubstantiated claims that paid agitators stoked violence among protesters — a claim Trump has made.
Assemblymember Jeff Gonzalez, a Coachella Republican and the only incumbent lawmaker who is a retired Marine, initially would not say if the scale of the Los Angeles protests warranted federal intervention, stating he did not have the “confidential intelligence” to weigh in. He also did not commit to supporting the same actions if they came from another president, arguing each situation is different.

But when a CalMatters reporter pushed for comments, Gonzalez pointed to videos of violence as justification for Trump’s deployment.
“When you have leaders that don’t step up, someone needs to step up, and that’s what took place,” he said.
State Sen. Steven Choi of Irvine told CalMatters that while he supports states’ rights, when immigration agents face violence or interference, “it is appropriate for federal authorities to protect both those agents and federal properties.”
Sen. Tony Strickland, a former mayor of Huntington Beach, said there is precedent for federalizing the California National Guard to quell domestic riots, referencing the 1992 turmoil in Los Angeles over the acquittal of police officers who killed Black activist Rodney King.
But in that example, then-President George H.W. Bush deployed troops at the request of then-Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and then-Democratic Mayor Tom Bradley. The riots were also far more violent, resulting in 63 deaths. 
Strickland argued that deaths have been avoided in Los Angeles only because Trump sent in the military, echoing the president’s assertion that the city otherwise would have burned to the ground.
“Do you wait till 63 people die before you call them in?” Strickland said.
Blaming California’s sanctuary law
The Republicans argued that Trump’s use of military force was necessary because of California’s 2017 sanctuary state law, which has been upheld in federal court. 
Their logic goes like this: Had California police been more cooperative with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, federal agents wouldn’t have had to arrest immigrants in the streets, Californians wouldn’t have been so riled and Trump wouldn’t have had to deploy troops to protect those agents.
Under current law, local law enforcement can choose to alert federal immigration authorities about an upcoming release of an inmate if they are convicted of violent felonies. Senate Republican Leader Brian Jones, of San Diego, failed this year to push through a measure that would have made the cooperation mandatory.

It is California’s lack of cooperation that forced federal immigration agents to hunt down “violent criminals” in public, Jones argued. He dismissed arrests, such as that of a 4-year-old girl on life-saving medication in Bakersfield, as “collateral.”
“When the federal agents are having to go into neighborhoods and find these violent felons to capture and report and prosecute … there are going to be collateral arrests in that, and that’s the state that Gov. Newsom and the Democratic leadership have created,” Jones told CalMatters.
Assemblymember Tom Lackey, a Palmdale Republican who served in the California Highway Patrol for 28 years, said the sanctuary law “created all of this fear and chaos.”
“What we are seeing now is a situation where the supermajority has limited tools to manage immigration; creating a communication breakdown between local and federal law enforcement, and a vacuum that invites a heavier hand from Washington,” he said in a statement.
But Madrid said blaming the tension all on the state’s sanctuary law is an “extraordinarily weak” argument.
“If that were the case, this would have been a situation long before,” he said. “It is consciously deceptive in telling a very, very small part of the problem.”
While Madrid called the state’s sanctuary law a “patchwork” policy, he argued immigration is an issue entirely “on the doorstep of the federal government.” The Trump administration has missed opportunities to rein in the border, Madrid argued, noting Trump last year helped kill a bipartisan legislative deal over border security. 
“What California has decided to do is to say: ‘Fine, if you are not going to control border security and … leave us as the largest border state in the country to deal with it, we are going to accommodate it. We are going to ingratiate people into the fabric of our culture, our politics and our economy,’” he said.
Could support for troops cost Republicans?
Aligning with Trump has its perks. The president — the face of a growingly populist party — can galvanize Republican voters and help legislators cement their conservative base. Even as the president’s approval rating slips among Americans, Republican voters continue to show strong support for him. 
But Republicans could lose ground, especially among Latino voters, over Trump’s fierce crackdown on immigration and the protests, Madrid predicted. 
While Latinos flocked toward Trump in 2024 despite the president’s promise of mass deportation, that threat is no longer “abstract” but “existential,” Madrid said. Moreover, more Americans are alarmed by Trump’s use of the military on its own people, he said.
“He so overplayed his hand on immigration crackdowns that it’s now about overreach and not about border security,” Madrid said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061425-No-Kings-Trump-Marines-REUTERS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-18 09:00:06.178198
,California,2025-06-18 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Lawsuit says federal government discriminates by funding Hispanic-serving colleges,Denise Amos,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/06/hispanic-serving-institutions-inland-empire/,The group whose lawsuit resulted in the US Supreme Court striking down affirmative action in college admissions is behind this challenge which could affect dozens of California colleges.,"In summary
The group whose lawsuit resulted in the US Supreme Court striking down affirmative action in college admissions is behind this challenge which could affect dozens of California colleges.


A lawsuit recently filed in Tennessee could affect colleges that serve large numbers of Latino students in the Inland Empire and throughout California.
Students for Fair Admissions, the national group whose lawsuit resulted in the US Supreme Court striking down affirmative action in college admissions, has joined a lawsuit recently filed by Tennessee’s attorney general against the U.S Department of Education.
The lawsuit says the education department’s special funding for programs targeting “Hispanic-Serving Institutions” is discriminatory and unconstitutional.  
Hispanic-Serving Institutions are colleges and universities where 25% or more undergraduates are Latino and a large share of the students are low income. The program is designed to help colleges and universities attract and support Latinos and other disadvantaged students. 
National studies show Latinos are more likely than non-Hispanic white people to be first-generation college students and to face financial, linguistic, and cultural barriers to higher education.
The Hispanic serving program has grown exponentially since federal laws created it in 1992.  The education department in 2023 spent $418.8 million on grants and assistance to colleges that qualified. They used the money for labs, libraries, tutors, student service programs, scholarships, fellowships, remote learning and other things. Special grants also support Latino students majoring in science, technology, engineering and math fields.
California has the most Hispanic-serving colleges — 171 of the 615 in the United States — including most Cal State and University of California campuses. About nine in 10 Latino students in California attend Hispanic-serving institutions.
Most of the Inland Empire’s colleges and community colleges are Hispanic-serving, including Cal State San Bernardino, which reported 72% of its undergraduates are Latino, and Riverside Community College, where 68% of its students are Latino.
Taken together, Riverside’s three community college campuses are the largest Hispanic-serving institution, with more than 59,000 students, said Wolde-Ab Isaac, chancellor of the community college district. The federal government sends it $3 million to $4 million a year through the Hispanic-serving program, but that’s only about 1% of its more than $300 million budget. 
Without it, the district would find a way to still provide the same services, he said, because that is part of the college’s mission.
“We are serving the underserved. Our populations are educationally and economically underserved,” Isaac said. “This is a system failure … We have a category of our people that have been deprived over many years of neglect, creating generational gaps, both in terms of economic inequalities, social inequalities, health disparities.” 
Targeting funding to colleges that provide them with extra support and services is fair, he said. 
The Inland Empire is one of the few regions in California where high school enrollments and graduating classes are increasing, he added, but the region also has some of the lowest college-going and college graduation rates in the state.
“We have the most dynamic, the most diverse, the most vibrant population of any (college) and we have a much bigger share of poverty in our areas,” he said. “We have so many young kids compared to any place else and yet those opportunities are not there to help them unlock those talents.”
Hispanic-serving institutions operate in 30 states.  Tennessee is suing because none of its colleges has that designation. The lawsuit notes that Tennessee’s colleges have enrolled Latino students, but they fall beneath the 25% threshold. 
“To be sure, all Tennessee colleges and universities serve Hispanic students,” the suit states. “They also serve needy, low-income students of all ethnicities. But under the statute, they get no HSI money because they lack enough members of one particular ethnic group. So all students at these schools suffer.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/042224_Inland-Empire-JAH_CM_15.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-18 09:00:06.178198

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Senate Republicans are eying a provision in Congress’ budget bill that would allow the federal government to sell off parcels of public land, and over the weekend made tweaks to the proposal that drastically increased the amount of land available for sale in Utah. 
Previously, the proposal — spearheaded by Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee — would have allowed for about 1.9 million acres of land in the Beehive State to be sold. Now, an amended version of the bill would allow for nearly 18.7 million acres in Utah to be eligible for sale, according to an analysis from The Wilderness Society.  
A spokesperson for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources confirmed the amendments.

The bill still has a cap on how much can ultimately be sold. The U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management would each be required to select between 0.5% to 0.75% of the land they manage in 11 Western states — that totals out to roughly 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. 
The bill states that the land would be used for housing, directing the secretaries to prioritize nominating parcels that have access to existing infrastructure, are next to developed areas, or are “suitable for residential housing.”
The initial version of the bill identified land that was off-limits, which included anything with a federal designation like national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas or national recreation areas. It also exempted land with a “valid existing right,” defined in the bill as a mining claim, oil and gas lease, or a grazing permit. 
But a grazing permit is not considered a “valid existing right,” experts say — so over the weekend, the definition was stripped from the bill, which opens up land used for grazing for potential sale. 
“It effectively doubled the acreage that could be on the table for sale. That has serious ramifications in Utah,” said Michael Carroll, who directs the Bureau of Land Management program for The Wilderness Society. “Ranchers and recreation communities are really going to be the big losers of this legislation.”

According to an analysis from The Wilderness Society, about 120 million acres in 11 states were eligible for disposal in the initial version — now, more than 258 million acres are eligible. 
Consider this Utah-specific breakdown: 

In the original bill, about 873,600 acres of U.S. Forest Service land and more than 1 million acres of Bureau of Land Management land was eligible. That’s roughly 1.9 million acres total. 
Now, about 6 million acres of U.S. Forest Service land and 12.6 million acres of Bureau of Land Management land are eligible. That’s about 18.7 million acres total.


Among the land in Utah that meets the definition in the bill are Forest Service parcels along the Wasatch Front in Big Cottonwood, Little Cottonwood, Millcreek, Parleys, American Fork, Emigration, City Creek and Provo canyons; swaths of land in the Uinta, Wasatch, Bear River, La Sal, Tushar and Henry mountains; large stretches of Bureau of Land Management land along the Colorado and Green rivers; a huge chunk of Dixie National Forest and the San Rafael Swell; and Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service land that borders all five of Utah’s national parks. 
Plus, if the Trump administration or Congress moves to rescind Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, that could make millions more acres eligible. 
Lee’s proposal is part of the 10 Senate bills that will make up Republicans’ reconciliation package nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill.” The senior Utah senator has long advocated for using federal land as a possible solution to the housing crisis. Nearly 63% of the state is owned and managed by the federal government and in a video address last week, Lee said his proposal would let communities surrounded by federal land manage growth.  
“We’re opening underused federal land to expand housing, support local development and get Washington, D.C. out of the way for communities that are just trying to grow,” Lee said in a video address. “We’re talking about isolated parcels that are difficult to manage, that are better suited for housing and infrastructure. To our hunters, anglers and sportsmen, you will not lose access to the lands you love. Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands.” 
Environmental advocates don’t buy that explanation. Laura Peterson, a staff attorney for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said that while the bill’s intention is housing, there’s really no mandate. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“That’s only what’s given priority consideration. That’s not a requirement for lands to be sold,” she said on Tuesday. “They’re talking about infrastructure to support local housing, but that’s undefined. One could interpret that to mean pretty much anything. Is that a shopping mall? Maybe. Why not?” 
Here’s a breakdown of what else is proposed in the bill, and some of the changes made over the weekend:

Eleven states — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming — are eligible. Montana is exempt. 
Before disposing of land, the secretary of either the U.S. Department of Interior, or Agriculture, should consult with state and local governments, and tribes. 
Each nomination would require a description of how the land will address housing needs or “infrastructure to support local housing needs.” 
Land that’s nominated by a local government, is next to existing developments, has access to infrastructure and is suitable for residential housing would be prioritized. The bill previously prioritized land that would reduce checkerboard land patterns or isolated tracts that are difficult to manage, but that was cut. 
The bill previously stated that the land would be sold for fair market value, but that was also axed over the weekend.

Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, will face Democratic candidate Ryan Cagle, a progressive faith leader and community organizer, in a special election on Tuesday to fill a seat vacated by former Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Reed, R-Jasper, who stepped down at the beginning of the year to join Gov. Kay Ivey’s administration as Senior Advisor to Workforce Transformation.

Woods in a phone interview Monday described his run for the Senate seat as a “natural progression of (his) public service,” pointing to his commitment to continuing the “strong conservative leadership” and “conservative values,” he said, that have defined the district for years. He cited the passage of the “Alabama Child Protection Act,” a bill he sponsored making it illegal for anyone to create, share, or possess child sexual abuse material, and carrying the “Parents Right to Know Act” in the House, which required schools to post classroom curricula online.
The representative also pointed to his votes in favor of grocery tax cuts and eliminating sales tax on feminine and baby products.
“I will continue to look for ways to provide tax relief for the people of the state while fighting for more jobs and more resources for rural Alabama,” he said.
Cagle said that the state’s policy should better support the community, saying that his decision to run stems from a desire for “proper representation in Montgomery of working-class and vulnerable people in District 5.” Cagle criticized current elected officials for not being “on the ground” and directly addressing issues like poverty and the opioid crisis. He also criticized the influence of lobbyists and big corporations on state leadership, saying that many have been “bought and sold.”
“The system’s not set up for working-class people to run. It privileges wealthy, affluent people in our communities to lead us,” he said, adding that he wants to bring a voice that “reflects the majority of the people’s lives and lived experiences in our district.”
Cagle said that dissatisfaction with the status quo goes beyond party lines, claiming that even Republicans in the district are considering voting for him due to his community work. He said that ongoing problems such as rising poverty, hunger and opioid overdoses stem from electing similar individuals, regardless of their political affiliation.
“I hope that my campaign, if anything else, can be a seed for us beginning to think more critically in District 5, beyond these party lines, and looking toward how we as a community, as a district, can come together and work together and put our people first,” Cagle said.
Woods said he would not “be sitting still (on) day one.” If elected, he plans to re-introduce bills to increase the criminal penalties for making violent threats, such as a bomb threat, to schools, and a bill aimed at expanding broadband internet resources in underserved areas. The legislation would remove state sales tax on broadband equipment funded by federal grants to allow more of the grant money to be used for infrastructure development.
Woods did not answer how he would propose handling federal budget cuts being floated by Congress, which could cut an estimated $5.54 billion in federal funding to Alabama for SNAP and Medicaid over 10 years in the House proposal, but said his priority is on rural health care and providing access to medical care in underserved areas. Regarding potential changes to the Department of Education, such as a proposal to eliminate it, Woods said he believes that the state would be able to provide a “common-sense Alabama-based education.”
Cagle called for “reprioritizing what we want for the state and what we want the community.” He said he opposes cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP, but also argued that the state can make up the difference with resources he said are often mismanaged, saying that a majority of the land in Alabama is owned by “a handful of people,” preventing potential tax revenue. He was also critical of the “CHOOSE Act,” which expands funding for private schools and homeschooling, arguing it’s a “poor stewardship of our money and resources” that primarily benefits “wealthy, affluent Alabamians” and underfunds public schools.
Considering Republicans’ supermajority in the Senate, Cagle said that if elected he would engage in “bridge building.” He said that he would draw from his experience organizing, saying that “the work of caring for our community has transcended those boundaries.”
“This is the first battle of many. It’s time for change,” Cagle said.

Emboldened by that display of fundraising prowess, the 40-year-old Orlando Democrat is now announcing his bid for the U.S. Senate in 2026, in a race that he surmises may require raising up to $100 million to compete against Republican Ashley Moody.
In addition to the challenge of raising that prodigious amount for his own candidacy, he is asserting that he intends to help Democratic congressional candidates financially throughout the state next year.
“We built what I believe is the strongest fundraising infrastructure in the country right now during our last campaign,” Weil told the Phoenix earlier this week in a video conference call. “I believe that we have the opportunity and the ability to raise a lot of money, and that’s what Florida needs. That’s what the Florida Democratic Party needs. Someone can take that money and invest across the state.”
Weil has been floating that idea recently. In an appearance in Clearwater last month, he said his team is poised to raise $10 million for voter registration efforts in Florida leading up to the 2026 election, with an emphasis on Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties.
Weil (as well as fellow special election Democratic candidate Gay Valimont, who ran and lost in the Panhandle in April) benefitted by being one of the few candidates running during the first months of Donald Trump’s second presidency.
Those contests gave Democratic voters across the nation an opportunity to voice their opposition to Trump by contributing to those two special elections — which would have allowed the Democrats to chip away at the then razor-thin GOP majority in Congress. Campaign finance records showed that the vast majority of financial contributions that Weil received came from outside of the Sunshine State.
Additional skepticism resides in the fact that previous Florida Democratic Senate candidates made bold assertions of fundraising for voter registration efforts that failed to occur.
Voters concerns
Weil is a single father of two boys who had been working as a public school teacher in Osceola County before he filed to run in Florida’s 6th Congressional District special election late last year. An election was necessary after President Trump tapped the GOP incumbent there, Mike Waltz, to serve as National Security Adviser. (Waltz left that position earlier this year, and was nominated by the president on May 1 to become the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, though he hasn’t come up for a Senate confirmation vote yet).
Weil previously had been a candidate for a brief time for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 2022 before dropping out.

As a public school instructor, he said, he intended to make public education a central plank of his platform, but learned quickly that Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and veteran’s benefits  were top of mind of District 6 voters.
“They were far more concerned about how they’re going to continue to survive in a Florida that’s become increasingly unaffordable with housing challenges and insurance challenges,” he said.
Weil has been touring the state before Democratic voters even though he’s only now entering the Senate race. The issue of affordability is something he hears all the time from the public. “There’s people in every corner of Florida who are struggling to survive,” he said.
When asked where he stands on immigration, Weil calls it “an incredibly complicated issue” that touches on border security, law enforcement, agriculture, labor, and tourism.
“There are cascading effects to immigration which make it one of the most difficult to deal with — and it’s why, as you mentioned, we’ve seen people really struggle with this in the Senate, because there are so many variables to try to control for it to ensure that you’re not doing more damage in one area than you are relief in another,” he said, labeling the Trump administration’s goal for mass deportations “sheer recklessness.”
Weil blasted some of the actions from ICE that have been reported in recent month, “where people are being dragged out of schools and churches and workplaces. Where people are seeing their neighbors being dragged off by plain-clothed officers,” he said.
Democratic ‘messaging’ a problem?
When asked about the polling from last year’s general election that showed immigration and the economy as the two top issues that led voters to support the GOP, Weil blamed “messaging” more than the  policies of his party for that outcome.
“I’m not going to be the first person to say that the Democratic Party has struggled with its messaging in recent years,” he said. “Immigration and the economy are definitely areas that we struggle to get our message out in recent cycles.”
He quickly added that he thought President Joe Biden “did some amazing things,” specifically referring to the billions of dollars to expand access to clean drinking water — not a usual talking point you hear from Democrats in assessing the Biden presidency.
He did say that Biden “struggled to get his message out as a leader” in the latter part of his time in office, and that Democrats need to take heed of that. “We need to get out and meet voters where they are with a message that they can believe in.”
As the Democratic Party searches for new ways to break through with the electorate, party chair Nikki Fried has floated the possibility of opening the party’s primary election to non-party-affiliated voters, who comprise more than a quarter of the state’s voting population. Weil offers, “We’d love to see everybody with an opportunity to vote.”
While Weil’s strong fundraising is something he’s proud of, not all Democrats in the state seemed to be happy about it. Some consultants said the money could have been better spent on party infrastructure instead of contests in which the odds were nearly insurmountable, like both special elections held in red districts this spring.
Some questioned his own spending in that race. His campaign spent more than $600,000 for musical talent at campaign events (which on one occasion featured R&B icon Patti LaBelle). Weil insists the money was well spent as he looked for ways to attract voters who might not have been paying attention to a congressional race in the early spring.
“This was an April 1 election. Up until the final week, major news [organizations] weren’t covering this. We needed to find ways to attract people outside of just political realms,” he said.
“I think music is a great area to reach out to people away from the political realm. You know, attract them and be able to then deliver your message. So we set up a large number of concerts. We brought out a bunch of talent. It was all something that I wanted to do to District 6. We see these things happen all the time in Orlando and Miami and bigger areas. And I told the people of District 6 – you’re all worthy of investing in as well. Your vote is just as important as a congressional vote in Miami. And so I wanted to bring talent, I wanted to bring events that district doesn’t normally get.”
No barometer reflects how far the Republican Party has ascended and Democrats have receded in state elections more than what happened in last year’s race for the other Senate seat in Florida, held by Rick Scott. In his three previous statewide elections, Scott never won by more than a single percentage point. But last year, he defeated Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by 13 points.
So, how will Weil, if he wins the Democratic primary next summer, fare against newly appointed Republican Sen. Ashley Moody?
“We just went in to District 6 down by a loss of 32 points and we ran a strong economic message,” he said. “We knocked on over half-a-million doors. We were on the ground, meeting with voters where they were at. And we pushed it to 18 points. I believe that we can do the same thing, district-by-district, county-by-county across the state. We push an R-13 [district] by 18 points and we win by 5.”
Republican Party of Florida Chair Evan Power slammed the news of Weil announcing his candidacy for U.S. Senate.
“Unhinged Josh Weil wants to bring his failed congressional campaign statewide? Despite spending 10s of millions of dollars, the residents of Congressional District six saw through the ads and learned the truth about radical leftist Josh Weil,” Power told the Phoenix in a text message. “The people of Florida will come to the same verdict and realize he’s just too dangerous to represent Florida.”
A request for comment from Ashley Moody’s Senate campaign was not immediately returned.
Weil’s announcement of his candidacy comes just days before state Democrats convene in Broward County this weekend for the Florida Democratic Party’s Leadership Blue event. By becoming a top sponsor to the event, he’s been awarded a speaking spot. That upset Tamika Lyles, who has already declared her candidacy for the Senate seat. Weil says he doesn’t understand the concern.
“The opportunity is there for every candidate to be able to give back to the party and have an opportunity to speak back to them as a result of it,” he says. “It’s an open, fair board. Anyone can purchase those sponsorships.”

Three other cruise ships are seen moored to the Juneau docks. (Video screenshot)The U.S. Coast Guard is investigating a near-collision between two cruise ships in the Port of Juneau that occurred Monday, when one of the two ships broke loose from its moorings and drifted toward the other.
“Our investigations division, they’re running with a standard investigation, just like we would do with any similar such incident, just to investigate if there’s anything that could have gone better or not,” said Lt. Matt Naylor, public affairs officer for the Coast Guard sector covering Southeast Alaska.
“Thankfully, nobody appeared to be injured. There didn’t appear to be any significant damage, so they’re going to be proceeding forward with that investigation, and we’ve gotten some videos from the public already, which have been super helpful,” he said.
On Monday, a sudden storm prompted the National Weather Service to issue the first-ever severe thunderstorm warning for Alaska’s capital city. 
High winds and heavy rain hit Juneau’s port, where the cruise ship Celebrity Edge was moored at the AJ Dock, a privately owned facility.
Videos taken by local residents and shared on social media appear to show the ship breaking its moorings and being blown toward the Carnival Luminosa, another cruise ship moored in the middle of the port.
The Edge’s drift stops only when it drops anchor in the middle of the port, halting it short of the Luminosa, which later maneuvers further away and leaves the port. 
The Edge later returned to shore without incident.
After the near-miss, the Coast Guard put out a call on local social media, asking for additional videos. Thanks to local residents, it no longer needs videos, Lt. Naylor said.
“At this point, we’ve gotten tons of submissions,” he said.
Naylor was unable to say on Tuesday how long the Coast Guard’s investigation will take.
“We’re grateful for everybody who has submitted videos to us, and we are especially grateful that this did not end up being anything bigger than it was, with no injuries and no significant damage,” he said.
“That’s what we’re the most grateful for, and we’re grateful to the crews of all the ships that were involved for their fast action.”

Ada Sipuel Fisher became the first Black woman to attend an all-white law school in the South when she entered the University of Oklahoma Law School. 
Her parents had survived the 1921 Tulsa massacre, and her family moved to Chickasha, where she was born and grew up. She became valedictorian of her local high school and decided to become a lawyer after hearing Thurgood Marshall speak. 
With the backing of both her family and the NAACP, she applied to the University of Oklahoma Law School, which rejected her strictly on the basis of race. When Marshall began to represent her in her battle for admission, the Oklahoma Legislature decided to step in and create a brand-new law school in five days that was nothing more than a room inside the state Capitol, and the Oklahoma courts agreed these two law schools were “equal.” 
Her journey to law school began in 1946 with her law school application. A half-dozen Black students joined her in the fight. Two years later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in their favor, ending segregation for Black students in graduate programs. 
After the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the law school could not bar students based on race, Oklahoma officials decided to admit her. Although she recalled white classmates welcoming her, she was forced to sit in the back of the room behind a sign that read “colored” and had to eat in a separate part of the cafeteria. 
In 1952, Fisher graduated and began practicing law. In 1992, Oklahoma Gov. David Walters appointed her to the University of Oklahoma’s Board of Regents. She vowed to bring enlightenment to the position, noting that she had “suffered severely from bigotry and racial discrimination as a student.” 
After her 1995 death, the law named a garden to honor her, and a bronze plaque talked of “how the stone that the builders once rejected becomes the cornerstone.” The law school has since received more than $1 million to endow the Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher Chair in Civil Rights, Race and Justice in Law to teach, research and empower future lawyers.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/06104048/June18-update-Ada-Sipuel-Fisher.jpg,,,2025-06-18 09:00:06.178198
,California,2025-06-18 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Bay Area transit systems want more money. But their payrolls soared as ridership declined,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/bay-area-transit-budget/,"As Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislators negotiate a final version of the budget, their differences on transit financing will be a key issue.","When the COVID-19 pandemic hit five years ago, the state forced countless businesses to shut down and told millions of California workers to stay home.
The abrupt interference with normalcy had many financial, social and political impacts. One was to slash ridership and fare revenues of public transit systems, particularly in the transit-dependent San Francisco Bay Area.
The 27 Bay Area transit systems received $4.5 billion in federal funds, $5.1 billion in a one-time state appropriation and some ongoing state aid to cope with pandemic impacts. However, they say they are still hurting, with accumulated operating losses of several hundred million dollars since 2020, and they will face what they call a “fiscal cliff” in 2026 that would spark service reductions.
A strenuous campaign has been mounted to get more state aid and persuade Bay Area voters to pay more taxes. If anything, however, state support may be decreasing.
The California Transit Association, in a letter to legislative leaders, asked for $1.1 billion in one-time funds and an additional $1.6 billion a year in continuous funding.
However, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s revised state budget cuts transit support from the state’s “cap-and-trade” program of auctioning off greenhouse gas emission permits.
Newsom’s omission angered transit supporters and they persuaded legislative leaders, in their version of the budget, to maintain transit’s $1.1 billion in annual cap-and-trade money and include a $750 million loan to Bay Area transit systems.
As Newsom and legislative leaders negotiate a more-or-less final version of the budget over the next few weeks, their huge differences on transit financing will be one of the key issues.
Meanwhile, Bay Area legislators and civic groups are sponsoring legislation that would allow transit systems to seek higher taxes.
The state Senate has passed Senate Bill 63, which would authorize a regional sales tax, at least a half percent and possibly a full percent, to be placed on the 2026 ballot.
If the legislation wins final approval and voters pass the sales tax, it would generate about $500 million a year for the Bay Area systems, according to a Senate analysis of the measure. Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and the lead author of the bill, describes it as “a much-needed ray of hope.”
However, the sales tax bill has its critics because the region’s transit systems, particularly Bay Area Regional Transit, often appear to be controlled by their unions.
David Crane, who heads Govern for California and describes himself as “a proud Clipper Card carrier who rides BART and SF Muni,” fired off a sharp critique of BART to legislators, citing its much-expanded workforce, from 3,985 employees in 2019 to 4,292 in 2024, even as ridership declined.
“Between 2019 and 2024, BART’s boardings fell 57 percent yet staffing grew and annual payments to employees rose an astounding 32 percent,” Crane wrote. “That’s a big problem because payments to employees now amount to $171,000 per employee, up from $140,000 in 2019, and constitute 54 percent of BART’s net operating expenses.
”Employee productivity at BART is poor and moving in the wrong direction. Before you ask taxpayers for more money for transit agencies, you must require transit agencies to dramatically improve employee productivity. I know that frightens you because of the political power of public employee unions but public transit is a public good that must be run for the benefit of the public. If you stand tall and together, you can prevail.”
Crane’s critique didn’t prevent the Senate from passing SB 63 by a 28-10 vote, but it raises some valid issues about productivity that could be applied to many public services and could affect a transit sales tax election next year.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/060723_BART_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-18 09:00:06.178198

The Legislature turned away a couple bills to change the state's campaign finance laws. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Two bills that would have altered the state’s campaign finance laws on political parties and donations died in the Alabama Legislature this year.
HB 6, sponsored by Rep. Phillip Pettus, R-Killen, would have prohibited political parties from disqualifying candidates who accept campaign contributions from specific organizations.
“They should not have a say in where you take your money from,” Pettus said in a phone interview Monday. “What it boils down to, they want to control the money. That is the political party. They want all the money to come from them, and they divvy it out.”
The Alabama Republican Party in 2023 adopted a rule prohibiting the party’s candidates for superintendent or school board from accepting campaign contributions from the Alabama Education Association, an organization representing educators in the state.
According to Pettus, the Republican Party had planned to extend the rule to disqualify people who accept campaign contributions from the teachers’ union to legislators but has since changed its position.
“I still have the bill,” Pettus said. “I am waiting to see if they try to extend it to legislators. If they do, then the bill will be ready to go again.”
“The state party is glad that the Legislature did not take action on HB 6,” said John Wahl, chair of the Alabama Republican Party. “There have been multiple court rulings over the years that have said the parties have the authority to associate with who them want under the First Amendment. I believe this bill would have violated the Party’s First Amendment rights and constitutional rights, and we are pleased the bill did not make it out of committee.”
The Alabama Democratic Party has no rule or regulation similar to what the Alabama Republican Party has imposed.
“It sounds like the Alabama Republican Party has some internal divisions they need to deal with,” said Tabitha Isner, vice chair of the Alabama Democratic Party. “I don’t see why the state legislature should be making laws about how parties decide who can and cannot represent them on the ballot.”
Pettus received $56,500 in direct contributions and $5,000 from in-kind donations from Alabama Voice of Teachers for Education (A-VOTE) since 2018, the political action committee for the state’s educators.
Pettus said prior to the start of the 2025 session that his constituents should decide whether a candidate should accept money from a political party, adding that he represents his constituents and not the Alabama GOP.
The bill was assigned to the House Constitution, Campaigns and Elections Committee but was not considered for the session. The same committee also did not consider the bill in 2024 when it was filed then.
The Alabama Legislature also failed to pass SB 291 into law, sponsored by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville, which would have allowed a political party to transfer funds to local or other affiliated party organizations currently prohibited by law.
The state has banned political action committees from transferring money to each other since 2010. Givhan’s bill would have added language allowing political parties to transfer money to local county organizations and affiliated entities.
“Those of us who support the bill, while we don’t want to unwind the PAC to PAC transfer ban, we didn’t feel like that was the intention of where a state party couldn’t share with a county party of a group that was affiliated with its bylaws,” Givhan said in an interview Monday.
Political parties are closely related to political action committees in the state, entities that are not required to disclose their donors, who can then use the proceeds to fund campaigns to support candidates or causes.
“This year, I got with Sen. (Bobby) Singleton, (D-Greensboro), and he co sponsored it with me,” Givhan said. “It went through committee very quickly and just never went anywhere.”
One benefit of the legislation is that it would allow a political party to have a joint program with another political party.
“If a county party and a state party want to partner, if you will, on a project, the current law makes it difficult to do that,” Givhan said.
The Alabama Democratic Party supports the bill.
“The point of the prohibition on PAC to PAC transfers is to increase transparency and reduce the shell game that hides who is really funding what,” Isner said. “The unintended consequence of that law was that it doesn’t allow local party groups to collaborate with each other or with the state party. Cleaning up this law so that it does only what it intended to do is a smart move that both parties should support.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Vote-reflection-in-pillar-May-7-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 09:00:06.178198

Green Health Laboratories was the sole applicant in this offering after the commission reopened an application window for state testing labs.
The lab will be the only medical cannabis testing lab in the state until AMCC reopens the application process. There are no limits on how many testing laboratory licenses the commission may award.
The AMCC opened a one-month window in February for parties to request an application for state testing laboratory licenses. Of the five requests the commission received, only Green Health Laboratories completed an application. There was a 30-day public comment period that closed on June 15, without receiving any public comments.
Tuesday’s vote to award the license came after Green Health Laboratories president Brandon Biles and laboratory director Natalie Siracusa presented their Foley-based testing laboratory to commission members at a June 12 meeting, where they said the company prioritizes patient safety and compliance.
“That was an interesting presentation. I thought they did a great job. So, we’re glad to have Green Health Laboratories present for us,” said AMCC Chair Rex Vaughn Tuesday. 
At a June 12 meeting, Vaughn said that they would be “the firewall for safe dispensing of cannabis products in Alabama” being the only testing lab in the state.
During the lab’s presentation the week prior, commission member pharmacist Sam Blakemore raised questions regarding quality control, particularly concerning heavy metals and fungi, and the ability to address dispensary concerns during Green Health Laboratories’ presentation. Siracusa and Biles said they would be ready to conduct on-site collections and testing quickly if issues arise.
Under Alabama’s medical cannabis law passed in 2021, physicians can recommend the use of cannabis for patients with qualifying health issues. These conditions include chronic pain, PTSD, epilepsy and cancer-related pain. The law allows cannabis to be dispensed in forms such as tablets, tinctures, patches, oils and gummies, though only peach flavored. The use of raw plant material is not allowed.

Trump’s deportation plan relies in part on cooperation from local law[...],"(Photo: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A suit filed against the City of Las Vegas and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could have national implications for President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort by limiting the offenses for which individuals can be held on immigration detainers under the 287(g) program.
Trump’s deportation plan relies in part on cooperation from local law enforcement agencies to detain foreign-born individuals for 48 hours beyond their scheduled release so ICE agents can take them into custody.
The suit asserts that federal law allows ICE to request detainers from local police only in arrests involving controlled substances, and that ICE is acting beyond its scope and authority by asking law enforcement agencies to hold those arrested for any other offense, with the exception of theft crimes covered by the Laken Riley Act.
Congress passed that law earlier this year. It requires the Department of Homeland Security to detain an undocumented individual who is arrested for burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.  
“It would be outside of congressional authority for ICE to issue detainers,” for anything other than those offenses, says Ernest Herrera of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), who represents two Las Vegas residents who were turned over to ICE by the City of Las Vegas jail in 2018.
The plaintiffs in the Las Vegas case, Alicia Ines Moya Garay and Juan Jaime Lopez-Jimenez, were arrested for unpaid traffic tickets, kept in the Las Vegas jail beyond their scheduled release, and turned over to ICE without warrants.  
“I think the law is clearly on our side, especially since the Supreme Court got rid of the Chevron Doctrine,” said Herrera. 
The Chevron Doctrine, which was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court last year, held that courts, faced with an ambiguous statute, should defer to a federal agency’s interpretation of the law, as long as the interpretation was reasonable.
If U.S. District Judge Anne R. Traum agrees with the plaintiffs that ICE is exceeding its authority, the ruling could be applied to 287(g) partnerships nationally.
“We would argue that depending on which court decides on it, that it could apply nationally,” Herrera said, adding the issue of national applicability could be determined by the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in the case regarding Trump’s ban on birthright citizenship. 
In that case, the Supreme Court is determining whether injunctions issued by lower-court judges can block executive orders nationwide.
Last week, Traum denied the federal government’s motion to dismiss four causes of action in the suit against the City of Las Vegas and ICE, including the plaintiffs’ claim that ICE is exceeding its authority via the 287(g) program, and violating the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens and immigrants from being detained without probable cause.
Attorneys for ICE did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“Freedom from imprisonment without a judicial warrant or probable cause lies at the heart of the Fourth Amendment,” says the complaint filed by Garay, Lopez-Jimenez, and Arriba Las Vegas Worker Center, which assists migrants with immigration and labor rights. City law enforcement agents, the suit says, “ignore their constitutional mandate to uphold the Constitution, choosing instead to be an uncompensated extension of and receiving direction from” ICE.
Documents obtained by MALDEF in the case reveal the city provided ICE with information for detainers for 1,680 people between Jan. 1, 2017, and Feb. 28, 2019. Of those, ICE picked up 1,139 arrestees.
“The City of Las Vegas is one of the most diverse cities in the state with one of the highest per capita immigrant populations in the country,” says the lawsuit. “Local families are put at risk every day because of City Defendants’ collusion with ICE. Defendants’ policy and practice not only violate individuals’ rights, they also undermine community safety and waste local public safety resources.”
In October 2019, a day after then-Sheriff Joe Lombardo announced the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department would no longer honor ICE detainers, the City of Las Vegas, in a tweet, said the same.
LVMPD renewed its 287(g) partnership with ICE this month, despite repeated assurances earlier from Sheriff Kevin McMahill that the department would not assist with immigration enforcement.
On Tuesday, the city asserted it has not honored an immigration detainer since 2019.

SPRINGFIELD — The parents of a 10-year-old girl who allegedly was assaulted repeatedly by a 14-year-old student in the Taylorville School District have filed a federal lawsuit against the school district and the school bus company.

The lawsuit, filed by a Chicago law firm, contains five counts against the Taylorville School District and Durham School Services, including violations of the victim’s Title IX rights, of her right to bodily integrity under the 14th Amendment, willful and wanton negligence, and infliction of emotional distress.

The victim is identified in the suit as Jane Doe, a minor. Her parents are named in the suit, but Capitol News Illinois is not using their names because it would identify the girl.

The victim's mother said that over the course of a week between late January and early February 2024, her daughter was sexually assaulted by an older student on her daughter’s school bus and at her bus stop. The court filing alleges that the assaults ranged in severity from fondling to digital penetration, most often taking place on the school bus where the perpetrator cornered the girl.

On three separate instances, the perpetrator chased the girl away from a bus stop, held her down, and covered her mouth while he sexually assaulted her, according to the suit.

The lawsuit also alleged that the perpetrator told the girl that he would harm her and her family if she reported the abuse, and that “the perpetrator admitted that he did not even know (her) name when he repeatedly assaulted her.”

The girl is a special needs student living with autism and ADHD, according to the suit.

“We are talking about one of the most vulnerable members of our society — a young, 10-year-old, special needs girl,” the lead attorney on the case, Cass Casper, said during a news conference about the lawsuit Tuesday. “This young child was so confused and distraught by what was occurring that she did not even understand what was occurring.”A spokesman for the school district did not respond to a request for comment by CNI.

After reporting the incident, the mother said she obtained an emergency order of protection for her daughter and brought it to the principal of Taylorville Junior High School, who made a “safety plan” for her daughter. She said the plan prohibited the accused student from coming into contact with her daughter at school, which the order of protection already called for, and simply relocated him to another part of the school building.

“This safety plan was shared with the bus company, my daughter’s fifth grade teacher and office staff,” the mother said during a news conference in the Statehouse in January. “No one else knew of the assaults. No one else knew of the safety plan.”

During that news conference, Peden also said that after several meetings with the school board and multiple court orders, the student was removed from her daughter’s school and sent to an alternative school for the rest of the spring semester. However, in August, she received a phone call about the student’s reentry into her daughter’s school and again asked the school to remove her daughter’s perpetrator.

“We have laws where a student gets expelled for bringing a weapon on school grounds, but what about cases like this, when the student’s body is the weapon?” the mother said.

Casper said the school district conducted what he called a “radically deficient” Title IX investigation. He alleged the school district was “more concerned with absolving the school district of responsibility” than of fleshing out what events took place when and where.

Title IX is a federal law enacted in 1972 that prohibits sexual discrimination in any education program or activity.

The court filing alleged that once the assaults were reported, the parents were informed about several other young victims in the community that the perpetrator had previously inappropriately touched.

“We do have specific information from three other sources that there were similar, not the same, but similar acts that should have raised questions within the community and within the school officials,” Casper said.

The lawsuits also mentions a previous Illinois court case decision, which ruled that a school district is responsible for child abuse occurring on a school bus, alongside the section in the Taylorville School District’s Student Disciple Code that says student conduct on school buses, at extra-curricular activities, on any property within 1,000 feet of school grounds, and “prohibited conduct that is plainly visible to a person situated on school grounds even if the misconduct occurs off of school property” is enforceable.

The lawsuit also seeks compensatory damages for the cost of the girl’s psychological treatment and for her emotional distress, as well as the implementation of new policies that will “prevent future harassment and abuse.”

“Most of what the family has pursued in Taylorville has fallen on deaf ears,” Casper said.

During the news conference, Sen. Steve McClure, R-Springfield, spoke about the failure of a bill he sponsored seeking to expel students who sexually assault another student at school. That bill had 31 co-sponsors in the Senate, 13 of whom were Democrats.

“There are legislators that do not believe that there should be any expulsion or even suspension for any student at all,” McClure said. “There's a focus too much with some legislators on the perpetrator, we got to look after the perpetrator. What about the victim who can't even go to school without seeing someone that attacked them on a daily basis?”

Our collective efforts will not be confined to hospitals, but that is where they must begin.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Don Tinney: Vermont’s students, among others, shortchanged by exorbitant health care costs.","This commentary is by Don Tinney of South Hero. He is a high-school English teacher who is the elected president of Vermont-NEA, the union of 13,000 educators who shape the state’s future every day in our local public schools.


Since the beginning of the year, Vermont Healthcare 911 — a broad coalition of unions (including Vermont-NEA), business leaders, reform advocates and medical caregivers — has been sounding the alarm about Vermont’s dubious distinction of having the highest commercial insurance premiums in the country and why key sectors of the health care system — hospitals, Federally Qualified Health Centers, primary care practices and mental health services — are on the edge of financial collapse or can no longer meet patient needs.
Even the state’s largest insurance carrier, Blue Cross of Vermont, is facing an unprecedented depletion of reserves and mounting costs that threaten its fiscal solvency.
The specter of the affordability crisis in health care looms large. We all live in its shadow. Ever-rising commercial premiums and out-of-pocket costs, driven largely by hospital prices and budgets, are an existential threat to the well-being and stability of businesses, public schools, municipal and state institutions, health care workers, patients and families.
Since 2018 alone, the cost of a family insurance plan on Vermont Health Connect rose by a staggering 92%, making Vermont’s family premiums the most expensive in the country.
Between 2020 and 2025, premium contributions by school districts and school employees combined grew by more than 60%.
The major drivers are hospital and prescription costs. 
Every dollar spent on overpriced medical services and products and bloated hospital administration is a dollar robbed from children’s education. When premium rates rise dramatically, year after year, so do property taxes. Gov. Phil Scott and lawmakers should begin to connect these dots first when they talk about affordability and public education.
Reading the data reports of VHC 911 and talking with fellow members of its leadership council has led me to hope that legislators, regulators and the governor can be compelled, finally, to act in concert in the public’s interest. In fact, I am happy to report that two measures recently passed by lawmakers would begin to curb the unsustainable growth in hospital and drug costs.
Recall that the Act 167 report, issued last September, laid out an ambitious but achievable roadmap to ensure the financial stability of our hospitals, to revitalize community care, and to bring down costs for the commercially insured. When introducing its findings, Dr. Bruce Hamory could not have been clearer on the scope of the problems we face and the necessity for corrective action: “The platform for health care in Vermont has burned and requires rebuilding in a modern form with more sustainable governance and funding methods.”
Let’s start rebuilding — and this means regulating and lowering hospital prices. Vermont-NEA is fed up with price gouging, cost-shifting and blaming patients and working families for high prices. Recently, Don George, Blue Cross’s CEO, acknowledged that the beleaguered carrier has called on the Green Mountain Care Board “to implement hospital/payer-specific revenue caps — an important step toward affordability.” 
Additionally, the persistent and widespread financial harm endured by community-care providers — the bedrock of primary care, wellness and prevention, and mental health — is unconscionable.  Our union, therefore, will continue to strongly oppose cuts to essential services and frontline medical personnel by hospital executives.
If certain hospital leaders refuse to work collaboratively with legislators and GMCB to bring down prices and spending, and to manage their facilities more transparently and cost-effectively, they should step aside in favor of those who will.
VHC 911’s detailed revelations on unethical profiteering by UVMMC at the expense of the commercial insurance market and its exorbitant spending on administrative and management personnel who do not deliver patient care show us that we can lower hospital costs without compromising access to care or hurting the medical professionals who provide it.
Health care reform is within our reach if we muster political resolve, strengthen the Green Mountain Care Board and craft rate-setting policies, regulations and population health priorities informed by the Act 167 Report and VHC 911’s research.
Our collective efforts will not be confined to hospitals, but that is where they must begin.

Our property tax system needs to support Vermonters and incentivize the kinds of communities we want and need.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kate Hughes: It is time to tax second-home owners more.","This commentary is by Kate Hughes. Kate and her husband, Ryan Becker, are educators who grew up in Bethel. They now live in Woodstock, where their son attends a thriving public school within the Mountain Views Supervisory Union.


As the Legislature grapples with the future of education funding and finance, it is time for Vermonters to demand that our legislators, and Gov. Phil Scott, make it a priority to tax second-home owners more. My family’s story illustrates why this matters.
My husband and I are lifelong Vermonters who chose to stay in Vermont and raise our young son here, largely because of the public school system. We’re also public educators trying to make a life without additional resources beyond the paychecks we earn. We own a house assessed at just over $300,000, a house that took 15 years of work, saving and sacrifice to buy.
Last year, primary residents in our community saw a property tax increase of $639.15 per $100,000 of property value, while non-residents saw an increase of $368.45 per $100,000 of value. If a non-resident owned our $300,000 house, their property tax bill would have increased by about $1,100. But because we live here full-time, we saw an increase of nearly $2,000. It’s hard to argue that’s fair or equitable.
In many Vermont communities, there is now a real cost to the high volume of second-home owners who have arrived in recent years. They buy up limited housing stock, raise home values, inflate grand lists and make it very difficult for Vermonters who want to live and work here — and send their kids to our schools — to find affordable housing. It also means there’s a shrinking number of primary residents left to shoulder the cost of essential services.
This disparity now happens in communities across Vermont. Our tax system increasingly privileges wealthier individuals who own multiple homes, rather than supporting low- and middle-income Vermonters trying to rent or own one. It’s a system that makes it difficult for families and workers to stay here, at a time when Vermont desperately needs them. Locals simply can’t compete.
There is little downside to taxing second-home owners more. Many will simply pay it, because they have the wealth to do so. Some may decide to sell, but our housing market makes clear there’s a long line of prospective second-home owners who will buy up those houses and pay whatever Vermont charges.
And for the rare houses that don’t sell quickly, the prices will moderate and return within reach of people who live, work and send their kids to school here. It’s a win in any scenario.
The landscape has changed, and Vermont needs to change its property tax classifications accordingly. Taxing second-home owners directly addresses many of our most pressing crises — a high rate of vacant homes, a profound housing shortage, a profound labor shortage, declining numbers of primary residents to pay for essential services and declining school enrollment.
Our property tax system needs to support Vermonters and incentivize the kinds of communities we want and need, now and into the future.

(Jordan Gale/Oregon Capital Chronicle)It is a common phrase in treaties between the U.S. government and Indigenous American tribes: “Each tribe or band shall have the right to possess, occupy and use the reserve allotted to it, as long as the grass shall grow and the waters run, and the reserves shall be their own property like their horses and cattle.”
But as Angie Debo pointed out in her 1940 book “And Still the Waters Run,” grass still grows, waters still run and all the treaties have been broken by the federal government for mining, grazing, land for settlers and other reasons. Tribes are protected people under federal law even though they are sovereign nations within the United States.
Now, the Trump administration continues that federal tradition by breaking yet another treaty, this one between the feds, four Indigenous tribes and the states of Washington and Oregon. The 2023 agreement to restore fish runs is being revoked so corporations can generate electricity in the Columbia Basin. Prior to the agreement, salmon, steelhead and other native fish were being killed by hydroelectric dams along the Columbia River.
For the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Nation and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs of Oregon this is not a minor inconvenience. Fishing – especially salmon – is a sacred right, a duty for the tribe to protect the fish which feeds the people. Removing the fish protections from the dams erases a major part of the tribe’s identity and culture.
A major issue for the tribes is because of the dams, the salmon are disappearing at an alarming rate. Shannon Wheeler, Nez Perce tribal chairman, told the Oregon Capital Chronicle to eliminate the treaty is to deny the truth of what is happening.
“This action tries to hide from the truth,” Wheeler said. “The Nez Perce Tribe holds a duty to speak the truth for the salmon, and the truth is that the extinction of salmon population is happening now.”
Because Congress has the final say about dams, U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, in January introduced legislation protecting the Lower Snake River Dams, an action which erases the treaty with the tribes. Risch applauded Trump’s move, calling it “common sense.”
What would be more common sense is encouragement of other forms of electrical generation. Sources such as wind power, solar and geothermal are now being discouraged by the “big, beautiful bill” now in the Senate. There are alternatives out there, electricity could be generated using other renewable resources beyond hydropower.
By using these other resources, the U.S. could help tribes protect their cultures while still generating power for all citizens.
For anyone who would say the tribes no longer matter, think of it this way: How would it feel to have someone erase the Fourth of July saying it is no longer important? That it no longer matters for Americans to celebrate their independence from King George III? It represents something that happened 250 years ago, so why should anyone care?
To tribal members, their cultures are not just a symbol, it is their way of life, the essence of their soul. It is their belief systems, their history and how they see and interact in the world. Erasing part of that does more than simply reduce the salmon population, it destroys the center of tribal culture.
The U.S. needs to honor their treaties – promises – to people they are legally required under federal law to protect. Congress should insist on keeping the treaty. Otherwise, why should the government be trusted to keep their word?

We must protect Medicaid and SNAP — not destroy them.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kendra LaRoche: We must not balance budgets on the backs of our most vulnerable.","This commentary is by Kendra LaRoche of Manchester. She is a member of the Upper Valley DEIA Solidarity Group and executive director of the Special Needs Support Center in White River Junction.


In recent weeks, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget proposal that would make the deepest cuts to Medicaid and SNAP (food assistance) in our nation’s history — slashing vital programs that thousands of Upper Valley residents depend on to survive.
As a member of the Upper Valley DEIA Solidarity Group and someone who works closely with our region’s disabled, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, Indigenous and rural neighbors, I cannot stay silent.
If these cuts become law, the impact on our communities in Grafton and Sullivan Counties in New Hampshire, and Windsor and Orange Counties in Vermont would be nothing short of devastating.
Medicaid cuts: loss of life-saving health care
The bill proposes mandatory work requirements for Medicaid coverage — a policy the Congressional Budget Office estimates would cause over 7.6 million Americans to lose health care.
In the Upper Valley, we estimate that approximately 59,700 people with disabilities rely on Medicaid for care. Many cannot work due to disability, and yet these cuts would force them into an impossible choice: prove “worthiness” or lose coverage.
Adding insult to injury, the bill would ban Medicaid funding for gender-affirming care — targeting some of our most vulnerable LGBTQIA+ neighbors at a time when attacks on trans rights are already escalating
SNAP Cuts: a recipe for hunger and hardship
The proposed cuts to SNAP are equally brutal:

Nearly $300 billion in funding cuts — the largest in the program’s history.
New work requirements extended to adults aged 55–64 and parents of school-age children — groups who already face barriers to employment in rural areas.
A shift of costs to states — likely forcing reductions in benefits or eligibility.

Who will this hurt? Rural, Disabled, and BIPOC families in our region who are already struggling to afford housing and transportation — let alone groceries
The local picture: Upper Valley at risk
Consider just a few facts:

In Grafton County, New Hampshire, 10.1% of residents — over 9,000 people — identify as Black, Indigenous or people of color. In Sullivan County, it’s 5.6%. These communities already face disproportionate health disparities and economic barriers.
LGBTQIA+ residents across the Upper Valley rely on Medicaid for mental health care, gender-affirming care and primary care — all under threat.
Over 585 people with disabilities served by the Special Needs Support Center alone stand to lose crucial supports if Medicaid and SNAP funding are gutted.
Rural hospitals in New Hampshire and Vermont — already financially fragile — could be forced to close as Medicaid revenues disappear. This would leave entire towns with no local healthcare.

A call to our senators
I urge our New Hampshire and Vermont Senators — Sens. Shaheen, Hassan, Sanders and Welch — to stand up for the most vulnerable among us and publicly oppose these budget cuts.
Medicaid and SNAP are not luxuries. They are lifelines. They are the difference between a child having dinner or going hungry, between an elder accessing needed medication or ending up in the ER, between a trans person accessing affirming care or facing discrimination and despair.
Our senators have long championed healthcare access and rural justice. We ask them now to vote NO on any budget that balances its books on the backs of disabled, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, Indigenous and rural residents.
The Upper Valley deserves better. Our neighbors deserve better. We must protect Medicaid and SNAP — not destroy them.

(Photographs courtesy Bryan Ramirez; graphic by Leslie Bonilla Muniz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)There’s a photo of me from 25 years ago — the last time the Indiana Pacers made it to the NBA Finals. I’m just a small kid in an oversized, puffy Pacers coat I got from a winter coat drive. But that jacket was more than just a coat. It was warmth. It was safety. It was a place to hide from a world I was still trying to understand.
I had just moved here from Venezuela. I didn’t speak English, know what the American dream was, or even who the Pacers were. I knew I was cold. I knew I felt different at age eight. I knew I didn’t understand why kids made fun of me for how I spoke, or why they told me to go back to my country.
I also knew that coat was my sanctuary. I’d zip it up, tuck my arms and head inside, and call it “Dexter’s Lab.” It was my safe space. My imaginary world where I didn’t feel so out of place. Where I didn’t have to share a mattress with my mom and sister. Where I didn’t have to hear drunk strangers pounding on the door of our apartment off 42nd and Post Rd.
And now, here we are.
25 years later.
The Pacers are back in the Finals.
And somehow, so am I.
I’m living the dream, right? Assistant principal, dad, husband, homeowner. I figured it out. I learned the language, the culture — even who Reggie Miller was. I learned how to blend in. I learned how to survive.
After all this time, I still stare at that photo — not just at myself, but at the other kid. The one without the Pacers jacket, without the warmth I had — the one ICE just detained.
Why him?
Why anybody?
I don’t have all the answers, but I do know this: I see the fear in our students’ eyes and hear it in their parents’ voices. For too many, the American dream still feels out of reach. All I want is to give every one of those kids a Pacers jacket — not just to keep them warm, but to remind them they belong here, too.
So here’s what we can do:
Check in with a student. Donate a coat. Volunteer with your local school’s English as a new language program. Support immigrant advocacy groups here in Indy.
We can’t change the system overnight, but we can show up. Showing up can look as simple as a  warm jacket, a kind word, or a little space where a kid feels like they belong.
Sometimes I wonder if the dream was ever real. For both of us.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Congressional Republicans are working to extend President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts by cutting spending on safety net programs, including Medicaid and SNAP, which helps low-income families buy food. These cuts would also carry major ramifications for state budgets around the country.
If Congress follows through with its spending cuts, Minnesota could lose out on hundreds of millions of dollars annually, forcing cuts to programs that serve elderly, low-income and disabled Minnesotans.
Minnesota, however, has slightly less at stake than other states. Around 32% of the state budget comes from federal dollars, mostly for Medicaid. The national average is 36%, and in some states like Missouri, Montana and Wyoming, the federal government covers nearly half of the budget, according to data from Pew Charitable Trusts. Half of Louisiana’s state budget comes from federal funding. 

Medicaid pays for health care for the elderly, low-income and disabled. The cost is shared between states and the federal government; last year, Minnesota spent $18 billion on Medical Assistance, which is Minnesota’s version of Medicaid. The federal government covered $11 billion of that.
A tax bill passed by Republicans in the U.S. House would cost Minnesota around $500 million annually in lost Medicaid funding, though it is still far from becoming law. A Senate version of the bill released Monday would make even deeper cuts. 
Minnesota is already facing a looming deficit; while lawmakers took steps in the 2025 legislative session to rein in spending over the next two years, they’re expected to make another round of cuts when they write the next budget in 2027.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/johnsonthune-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 08:00:01.681452

(Getty Images)Another member of Gov. Mike Braun’s administration pinned policy changes on former state leaders growing a child care and preschool subsidy program beyond its means. 
Adam Alson, the director of the state’s Office of Early Childhood and Out-of-School Learning, paraphrased his boss, Mitch Roob, who recently said Braun had “inherited a mess” with the Family and Social Services Administration. 
“One of those messes is with child care,” Alson told members of the Early Learning Advisory Committee on Tuesday.
Earlier this month, Alson’s department announced it would cut preschool programming from 6,000 seats statewide to 2,500 total children, citing a need for financial sustainability. Additionally, rates for providers would fall and eligibility would be narrowed. 
On My Way Pre-K will also be decoupled from the Child Care Development Fund, which subsidizes child care for impoverished families. The changes come after Holcomb’s administration introduced a waitlist for CCDF vouchers and OMWPK at the end of his term. 










While millionaires and billionaires are getting more tuition assistance for the private schools their children already attend, working families are being told that pre-K for their 3- and 4-year-olds is too expensive for the state.


– Rep. Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne


As of Tuesday, more than 23,000 children are on the waiting list with a little over 60,000 children currently using both programs. 
“Children were enrolled on CCDF vouchers throughout 2024 with really no plan to fund them,” said Alson about the prior administration, not naming former Gov. Eric Holcomb. “This is the situation that we find ourselves in.”
Alson added that the agency projected CCDF vouchers would fall from 70,000 to “somewhere between” 48,000 and 50,000 over the next few years due to reduced funding. The federal government sent Indiana $284 million in the current fiscal year for CCDF and is the main funding source for the program.
The General Assembly set aside $147.5 million in funding this year to maintain the current number of children using such vouchers but didn’t allocate enough to expand enrollment.
“Our first and foremost goal as an office and as an agency is to make sure that (kids losing vouchers) doesn’t happen and to manage our funding accordingly,” said Alson. 
Prior to COVID-19, Alson’s department spent $200 million annually, peaking at $900 million in 2022 with temporary federal funds earmarked to help providers stay afloat through that period of economic uncertainty. Spending fell to roughly $650 million last year and is estimated to be closer to $600 million this year, according to Alson’s presentation. 
Those limited federal dollars were used to expand enrollment in preschool and child care programming by 75% since 2021, Alson said, with the number of providers expanding by 20%. But state lawmakers directed dollars elsewhere in the 2025 budget-writing session, opting not to continue enhanced funding for the program after a dismal revenue forecast predicted Indiana would be short $2 billion in the next two years.

“We all recognized heading into this legislative session that we really needed the state to come through and make good on many of the changes that we had implemented over the last several years,” said Sam Snideman, the vice president of government relations for United Way of Central Indiana. “Unfortunately, the fiscal picture was what it was and things took cuts that we wish hadn’t been necessary.”
Indiana’s House Democrats, in a caucus release, noted that some of the most populous counties will see their providers rates fall by 50%, tying the cut in state funding for preschools to the Republican supermajority’s decision to fund universal “school choice” vouchers for the wealthiest Hoosiers.
“Working parents are already stretched thin. Now, they’re being told to do more with less – the theme of this administration. Cutting On My Way Pre-K means pulling the rug out from under hard-working families who were planning to use this program to make their household budget work,” said House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne.
“These cuts weren’t inevitable. In the 2025 budget, Statehouse Republicans chose to prioritize making private school vouchers universal. While millionaires and billionaires are getting more tuition assistance for the private schools their children already attend, working families are being told that pre-K for their 3- and 4-year-olds is too expensive for the state. That’s not budgeting — that’s bad priorities. Amid a budget shortfall, Statehouse Republicans found the money to expand a program that they cared about. It just wasn’t the program that benefits families struggling to get by,” he continued.
 The state of Indiana’s child care

Advocates like Snideman, who is a member of the committee Alson presented to on Tuesday, worry that reducing the number of children getting state assistance will undo recent progress to expand options for parents. 
Data from Brighter Futures Indiana, a partnership between the state and Early Learning Indiana, estimates that 328,271 Hoosier children under the age of 6 may need care in addition to 173,529 schoolchildren. 
But the state’s 4,000-plus programs only have a capacity to serve just under 200,000 children. That doesn’t consider whether the program will be high-quality enough to impact a child’s learning outcomes — though early education is tied to better reading scores, another hurdle for Indiana’s children. Nor does this metric consider affordability, which disproportionately shuts women out of the workforce. 
In Tuesday’s meeting, Alson explicitly acknowledged the “duplicative” impact of child care and preschool programming for families and communities, noting that parents can’t work without child care options.

“We know that (the current supply is) not enough. There’s more to be done out there for child care,” Alson said. 
But reducing enrollment and paring down on payments to providers and families will impact the state’s economy and reduce opportunities for parents — especially those with younger children — Snideman observed. 
“That’s going to mean potentially thousands of children who need care now won’t get it. Or they’ll get part-time pre-K or part-time care when they need full-time care,” Snideman said. “… when families don’t have the resources that they need, they are going to rightly prioritize their household’s stability.”
Provider cuts, in particular, could bring “an era of potential instability” for Indiana’s caretakers, he added. State officials said some providers have opted out of the state’s voucher programming.
Tuesday’s meeting offered a ray of hope, albeit slim, for child care advocates like Snideman, with an update on so-called microcenter pilots, which serve 30 or fewer children. Three such programs have begun operating with another set to open its doors this summer. 
Such facilities depend on a hub and spoke model, where administrative duties are handled by one main office and caregiving buildings can be smaller. Some devote only a sliver of a building to child care and share their space with restaurants or other businesses. 
The aim of the pilot is to lower regulatory hurdles for child care providers without jeopardizing safety, coupled with the ability to open such centers in rural, hard-to-serve areas. 
“I do think that it has the potential to be a really impactful program,” said Snideman. “I also will stress that we need to be diligent about collecting the right data and we need to be diligent about making sure that we use this as a genuine learning opportunity.”

Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.
In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) and Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) on the Senate floor on Jan. 8, 2025, the Senate's first day of session for the year. | Kyle Davidson Several Republican members of the Michigan House of Representatives were in Washington, D.C. this week to meet with members of the Trump administration, which has one state Democratic senator questioning their priorities as the budget deadline looms.
Speaking to reporters following the Senate session on Tuesday, state Sen. Darrin Camilleri said he was disappointed that his colleagues in the House were gone while Senate Democrats were still working. He also laid blame for the slow pace of the budget process at the feet of Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township).
“We’re here on the floor working hard, not only still figuring out budget priorities and discussions, but we’ve been working on legislation while House Republicans are in D.C. kissing the ring of the president,” said Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Brownstown) in a scrum with reporters following Tuesday’s Senate session. “We have very different priorities, and that’s very clear from the contrast this week.”
Camilleri said the goal was to have the two chambers’ budgets ready to go by July 1, and the state Senate rose to the occasion by passing its entire budget – including spending plans for schools and higher education – months ago. Meanwhile, the House has only pushed through its education budget. That’s left their colleagues in the Senate unaware of their other budget priorities, stymying the negotiation process.
“The span between their budget proposal and ours is about as big as the [Mackinac Bridge],” he said. “For us to see where they put their priorities, it’s only been about increasing costs. They increased costs for retirement. They’ve increased costs for school operations … [and] university operations.”
Camilleri added that proposed GOP cuts to universal free school meals and preschool will raise costs on families.
The senator said it was troublesome that several members of the House Republican Caucus were in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday to meet with President Donald Trump’s administration to talk about the congressional budget bill – and not hashing out their own budget at home.
“The thing I don’t understand is what they’re hoping to learn out of D.C.,” Camilleri said. “The budget bill that they passed out of D.C. only makes our jobs harder. It cuts funding to critical services like Medicaid. It puts on the chopping block additional funds that we would rely on to figure out our state budget. I don’t know what they’re going to get out of that trip, but they are wasting an entire week doing so.”
That said, Camilleri, chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on PreK-12, has met with his counterpart in state Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw Township), chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on School Aid and Department of Education. It was an informal breakfast that served as a means to get to know each other better, but Camilleri said if the public school budget negotiations were up to him and Kelly, they could likely have a deal done before July 1.
Camilleri then said that bolstered his belief that Hall was the problem in the process.
“If he were to let [House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Ann Bollin] or Tim Kelly do their jobs, I think we could actually get to a deal,” he said. “I know that [Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sen. Sarah Anthony] and Chair Bollin have developed a really good relationship the last couple months. Chair Kelly and myself had a great first meeting. I think that there could be some progress here, but because [Hall] has been micromanaging this process from day one, I don’t know how we can get a deal if he’s not letting his members do their jobs.”
It’s not all doom and gloom, though. 
Camilleri said there were areas of common ground between the two chambers. He said Hall wants more money funding schools, which the Senate agrees with. The devil is in the details in how that’s done. House Republicans passed a public schools budget with many of its past categorical spending on programs like school meals placed into per-pupil funding. Camilleri said the Senate wasn’t opposed to wrapping some of those programs up, it was simply a matter of doing that the right way.
Many of the programs that were rolled up into the foundation allowance are things Democrats in the House and Senate care deeply about, Camilleri said, and they fought hard in past budgets when they held all stations of state government to make sure they were funded appropriately.
“Their proposal guts most of them,” he said. “Are there some things I think we could find ways to just put into a per-pupil allotment? Perhaps. … But gutting the programs like at-risk [student] funding or free school meals, that’s just not somewhere where we’re going to go.” 
Camilleri said it wasn’t out of the question for the two chambers to start negotiating by July 1, but he wasn’t sure how the entire budget process could be completed by then.
It also wasn’t out of the question for the Senate to work through the summer on the budget with their House counterparts, but Camilleri said that if the parties can’t get something tangible done by July, he wasn’t sure how productive it would be to slog away in August.
“We can come back in September and try again in the fall,” he said. “But my hope is that if they can get to a target [of] negotiation by July 1, maybe that’s the first step of this process. … I’m being optimistic.”
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) confirmed with reporters after Tuesday’s Senate session that she and Hall were meeting on Wednesday to start discussing budget plans.
“I certainly hope that’s the main topic,” Brinks said. “It’s June 17. They have still not passed [a full] budget, so I am very eager to make progress there. It’s high time that we have those conversations. I am very pleased that he has finally accepted the opportunity to meet and I’m very hopeful that these will be productive conversations.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DSC_0896-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-18 08:00:01.681452

Ron DeSantis and his minions have perfected the art of bending and/or dispensing with the rule of law and long-held democratic norms in ways that have enabled Republicans to keep control of the state’s political levers.
During just about every news cycle, especially during legislative sessions, we see our high-handed chief executive belittling critics, sneering at perceived enemies, and rewarding his friends.
In their quest for unbridled power, Florida Republicans have wielded their immense political power in a multiplicity of ways to subvert the will of the people.
For example, Florida voters have long been able to use the citizens’ initiative process to bypass the Republican-dominated Legislature and advance progressive policies such as raising the minimum wage, legalizing medical marijuana, and restoring the voting rights of people with felony convictions.
Senate Bill 7050, which became law in 2023, illustrates DeSantis’ political tactics, using voter suppression to discourage Democratic and primarily Black and brown voters from being able to fully participate in the electoral process. Not doing this would leave them vulnerable to voters who would likely chase them out of office.
As the Florida Phoenix’s Michael Moline noted in a 2023 story imagining a handbook for autocracy: “… Republican-run states these days are experimenting with ways to disenfranchise Democratic constituencies, stack the courts against progressive initiatives, and cement their control over this country one state at a time. The dust cover could feature the smiling mug of Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, the Republican presidential candidate who since the Black Lives Matter summer three years ago has pushed an ever-more-reactionary campaign against marginalized communities, not least at the voting booth.”
A representative of the Elias Law Group pointed to the damage from the 2023 restrictions on third-party voter registration campaigns.
“Third-party voter registration organizations play a critical role in ensuring that every eligible Floridian has an opportunity to vote, especially Black and Brown Floridians,” said partner Abha Khanna. “These organizations have helped register roughly a quarter of a million Florida voters since 2018, yet they now find their important work under assault by Governor DeSantis and the Florida Legislature. SB 7050 threatens to disrupt and discourage these organizations from helping marginalized Floridians register to vote.”
However, the federal judge in Tallahassee recently allowed the state to enforce most of the law’s provisions pending completion of the litigation.
After observing the success of that law, DeSantis and Republicans set their sights on defanging that citizen initiative petition-gathering process, imposing a slew of burdensome constraints and penalties for organizations doing that work.
Lawmakers argue the petition restrictions are needed to reform a process they claim has been tainted by fraud. The Legislature pushed HB 1205 through months after Florida voters supported ballot initiatives to protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana, although the measures fell short of the 60% needed to pass. The governor signed the bill into law on May 5.
Gum up the process
this year’s HB 1205 contains a raft of requirements that gum up the petition process. For example, those gathering signatures, whether paid or volunteer, must be registered with the Division of Elections beginning July 1. Petition circulators must be Florida residents and U.S. citizens. Convicted felons are barred from doing that job unless their right to vote has been restored.
In addition, the law prohibits anyone who has “not registered as a petition circulator from possessing more than 25 signed petition forms in addition to his or her own signed form or one belonging to an immediate family member.”
Other provisions in HB 1205 include the demand that voters signing the form must provide a “current or valid Florida driver license and valid Florida identification card number, plus the last four digits of his or her social security number.” The signer must affirm that he/she has not been convicted of a felony, or, if they have, they have had their right to vote restored. Lastly, the applicant must affirm that he or she is a U.S. citizen and a Florida resident.”
The law imposes fines for petitions delivered to a supervisor of elections after the  deadline. Fines increase from a $50 fee for each late petition form to $50 for each day it’s late, up to a total fine of up to $2,500 for each tardy petition form. If the sponsor or petition circulator acted willfully, the bill increases the penalty from $250 for each petition form to $2,500.
The  law also creates a new fine for forms collected before the Feb. 1 deadline but submitted after that date. Each form received by a supervisor after the deadline results in a $100 fine for each day late, up to $5,000, and if the sponsor or petition circulator acted willfully, $5,000 for each late form.
Meanwhile, the deadline for submitting petitions has been shortened from 30 days to 10 days.
Longer, costlier
Groups involved in gathering petitions point to the deleterious effects the law has already had since DeSantis signed it into law on May 2. Florida Decides Healthcare says circulation has dropped 88% since then, and Smart and Safe Florida, a group advocating for the legalization of marijuana, says costs of securing petitions have ratcheted up 370% while signature gathering has plummeted from 78,000 a week to 12,000.
A representative from the Elias Law Group pointed to the damage from the 2023 restrictions on third-party voter registration campaigns.
Many of the affected organizations are devising ways around the new provisions, while other groups, like Smart & Safe Florida, are doubling down on their efforts to get enough signatures to put issues of concern to the public on the ballot.
They are busy working to get another measure on the ballot in 2026. In a court filing, Smart & Safe Florida officials characterized the new restrictions as “legislative gaslighting,” designed not to block fraud but to “effectively destroy the people’s right to invoke the citizen initiative.”
Critics contend that the new hurdles would make it prohibitively expensive and effectively impossible for grassroots campaigners to place measures on the ballot.
“This bill is not about improving the ballot initiative process. It attacks the fundamental freedom of Floridians to participate in their own democracy,” said Florida Decides Executive Director Mitch Emerson. “It is a calculated and cowardly attempt by politicians in Tallahassee to rewrite the rules  — not to serve the people, but to protect their own power.”
Emerson estimates the new law will mean millions of dollars in additional costs for his campaign in complying with new requirements and hiring more paid circulators to make up for volunteers who back out for fear of legal liability.
“Volunteers are second-guessing whether they can legally help. Communities are confused. And that’s exactly what the law was designed to do: to sow confusion and try to shut down engagement before it starts,” he said.
Emerson said Florida Decides had collected about 100,000 signatures to date in its push to bank 880,000 verified petitions ahead of a Feb. 1 deadline.
Obama-appointee Chief U.S. District Court Judge Mark Walker will determine whether DeSantis has unfairly manipulated the ability of Floridians seeking to continue to have access to direct democracy.

In March, President Trump signed an executive order under the guise of “restoring truth and sanity to American history by revitalizing key cultural institutions and reversing the spread of divisive ideology.”
In fact, the very opposite is true.
Instead, the executive order is an attempt to erase the factual experiences, treatment and contributions of Blacks, women and others by removing documents and other evidence from the nation’s museums and institutions.
Also, it’s purpose is to revive and glorify military leaders that led the fight to continue the oppression and disenfranchisement of Blacks.
This week as we celebrate Juneteenth  — a federal holiday commemorating the emancipation of Blacks from slavery — it is a good time to reflect on what the removal, and now the impending restoration, of Confederate monuments will or will not mean for our everyday lives.
The removal of some of the Confederate monuments in recent years has not made a difference in making things better:
In closing the great racial divide that is on display all across America. Bigotry, racism, prejudices, disenfranchisement of groups of people based strictly on skin color and economic station in life are still an ugly part of America.
In changing how Blacks are perceived and denied in the workplace.
In stopping how Blacks are treated by police and the criminal justice system, being stopped more often than whites with or without a legitimate reason, and receiving longer and harsher sentences and judgements than whites for the same or lesser offenses. This is commonplace in towns and cities across America.
In eliminating the perpetual education achievement gap where Black children are still locked in poorer inferior schools, where in racially integrated schools they are disciplined and expelled at much higher rates than white children for the same behavior and infractions.
More importantly, removal of Confederate monuments has not erased the ugly history of America they represent.
The bane of racist evilness that still remains is seen in the resurgence and boldness of white supremacy and blatant expressions of racial hatred.
So, what is the priority and purpose of the resurgence to recognize, honor and regale us in such an ugly and destructive time in American history by our president and his administration?
With an administration where so much of what is done with “made for TV” drama and flair, renaming and restoring visible symbols of an inglorious past under the guise of American gallantry is one more act taking center stage.
Displaying and honoring the vestiges of that period in public squares and other public spaces of southern cities, towns and state capitals only serve to make a statement that this part of American history is laudable and something to be proud of.
Proud of the horrible deeds of those men, and the lasting destructive attitudes, laws, and practices that resulted from them.
The resulting Civil War threatened the very existence of this country. What is the purpose of waving the confederate flag instead of or alongside the American flag?
It is long past time that America’s confederate history takes it rightful place within the walls of a national museum or several museums.
The long-standing and appropriate practice has been that American history is preserved in national and local museums where it is accessible to anyone who would like to revisit our past, visit it for the first time, or learn anew the real facts.
The Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest museum, educational and research complex, opened the National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2016. It is being targeted by the Trump administration.
Confederate statutes of generals, documents and other memorabilia belong in museums and designated parks to remind all Americans of a period in this nation’s history that was detrimental, inhumane, ugly and which should never be repeated.
Those reminders need not be destroyed or revered.
As the executive order to purge the collections and displays of historical accounts housed in some of our great museums and institutions is being caried out, will these reminders be recast, white-washed and honored?
The goal should not be to destroy history, but to learn from it.
Isn’t it enough to have lingering vestiges of racial conflict, inequality and oppression prevalent today and still affecting the quality of everyday lives?
It is progress to acknowledge that any period of human enslavement, oppression, servitude, and persecution in a country’s history is, indeed, a shameful and inglorious one.
To deny, disown or ignore it is not only crippling, but defeating.
There is a lot to be concerned about when it comes to these insidious efforts to rewrite the history of America.
We need to make concerted efforts to preserve the facts, major periods and their impact, and to make that information available to future generations.
Future generations need to know the complete American history — the good, the bad, to build a promising future.
Sadly, many American who regale in those times and symbols will likely continue to do so in their hearts and minds.
It begs the question why would any decent, compassionate, ethical, if not God-fearing, person want to honor and revel in such a time with visible, larger than life, reminders.
Only facing this scourge, confronting it, and actively taking the necessary steps to make things better will have lasting meaning.
Sadly, even then, there will be those who will stay stuck in the false sense of racial superiority that is merely a relic of America’s past.
Yes, Confederate flags and monuments are historical relics that too many are trying to preserve not because of their place in America’s history, but in an attempt to determine America’s future.
The president and his administration are leading the charge.

The report, published by The Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation focused on health care issues, used data from 2023 to measure every state’s health care access, quality and outcomes across six dimensions. 
Around 15% of nursing home residents nationally are administered antipsychotic drugs, according to the Commonwealth Fund study. In Missouri, that figure was just over 21%. Only Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota had higher rates. 
The data, collected by the federal government, excludes residents with schizophrenia, Tourette’s syndrome or Huntington’s disease — conditions for which antipsychotics are generally considered medically necessary.
Studies have found antipsychotic drugs are often administered to residents of nursing homes without medical necessity, posing medical risks and side effects. They’ve also been used for residents with dementia, other cognitive impairments, or behavioral issues to help control their behavior or sedate them without their consent. 
Research has found a link between low nursing home staffing levels and higher rates of antipsychotic drug use. 
The Commonwealth Fund’s findings echo a report last year from the U.S. Department of Justice that found Missouri in violation of federal disability law for unnecessarily institutionalizing thousands of adults with mental illness in nursing homes when they would be better off in a less-restrictive environment. 
Missouri is an outlier nationally in placing people with mental health needs in nursing homes.
The state is still in settlement negotiations with the DOJ over its findings, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Mental Health told The Independent. Missouri officials are working with the DOJ to come up with a plan to fix the violations identified in the report. If they can’t reach a resolution, the DOJ could file a lawsuit.
Beyond issues in Missouri nursing homes, the state’s health care system overall ranked 43rd out of the 50 states plus D.C. in the Commonwealth Fund report. While the state has seen improvements in areas like the adult insured population over the years since Medicaid eligibility was expanded, other metrics, like premature deaths from preventable causes, have gotten worse. 
Sara Collins, author of Wednesday’s report and Commonwealth Fund Senior Scholar and Vice President for Health Care Coverage and Access, said in a press briefing that the report “continues to reveal vast geographic variation in Americans’ coverage and access to care, health outcomes and people’s ability to live a long and healthy life.”
Congress is debating a budget bill that could cut millions nationally from Medicaid.
“Federal policy changes, both underway and proposed, threaten to reverse the improvements achieved by states, exacerbate areas of slippage,” Collins added, “and deepen geographic income and racial and ethnic disparities and health outcomes.” 
 36th on access and affordability

Missouri’s uninsured rate improved between 2019 and 2023, as was the case nationally: The adult uninsured rate fell from 14% to 11% in Missouri, and kids’ uninsured rate fell from 7% to 5%. Both are now on par with the national average. Missouri implemented Medicaid expansion in 2021. The rate of adults going without care because of cost also declined.
But on the access and affordability category overall, Missouri ranked 36th, with a higher-than-average share of people with medical debt in collections and rate of those with high out-of-pocket medical costs relative to their income.
 50th on avoidable hospital use and cost

Missouri especially struggled in the “avoidable use and cost” category, with only West Virginia ranking worse. That includes low primary care spending, high rates of preventable hospitalizations and avoidable ER visits. 
 40th on prevention and treatment

More children in Missouri lack preventative care than the national average. Thirty-five percent of Missouri children lacked medical and dental preventative care from 2022 to 2023. The national average was 32%. 
Children also had trouble accessing mental health care in Missouri, with 24% of kids not receiving  mental health care as needed, while the national average was 20%. 
Missouri was better than average in a handful of categories. For one, the state had fewer adults with substance use disorder who lacked treatment. Nationally, 77% of those adults lack treatment, but in Missouri that number is 73%, or 11th best in the country. 
 40th on healthy lives

The infant mortality rate got slightly worse from 2019 to 2023 and ranked 39th in the country.
“Threatened access to reproductive and maternal health care may further worsen infant mortality and sharpen current disparities between states,” the report noted, nationally. Missouri banned abortion until late last year, when it was legalized by initiative petition.
The rate of premature deaths from preventable causes got worse during the same period, and Missouri ranked 43rd in the country.
Additionally, more adults smoke in Missouri than the national average — 15% in Missouri versus 11%, or the 44th ranking. 
Missouri had lower-than-average alcohol deaths. 
 47th on income disparity and 31st on racial equity 

Missouri ranked among the worst states — 47th — for disparities in health care based on income. Low-income Missourians are far more likely to report fair or poor health than higher earners, and far more likely to have lost several teeth and/or be obese.

The proposal was less than a third of the $500 million corrections proposal released by Gov. Tony […],"“Republicans would rather have a talking point and try to portray themselves as tough on crime, when really what they are is very stupid and wasteful on crime,"" Sen. Kelda Roys said. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)GOP lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee approved a proposal for the Department of Corrections that includes an additional $62.9 million in state spending in 2025-26 and $73.8 million in 2026-27 as well as 18 new staff positions. The proposal was less than a third of the $500 million corrections proposal released by Gov. Tony Evers earlier this year, which he argued was necessary to pass in full in order to accomplish  the closure of the Green Bay Correctional Institution.
Evers’ plan, when released, included plans to overhaul the state’s correctional facilities, including closing GBCI, closing Lincoln Hills School for Boys and Copper Lake School for Girls and renovating other facilities as well as expanding earned release and taking steps to address recidivism rates.
Committee co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said GBCI, which was built in 1898, won’t be discussed until the committee takes up the capital budget later this week. He said the last budget helped reduce staffing shortages and that legislators want that work to continue with the portions of the budget taken up on Tuesday.
“As I’ve talked to the prisons in my district, they’re happy to see that their recruit classes are much larger, and the vacancies are about half of what they were prior to the last budget, so we think that’s working well,” Born said. “The next phase of this is to talk about the capital budget investments, which will happen on Thursday.” 
The proposal passed by committee Republicans also includes additional investments in the state’s adult institutions, including $65 million across the biennium for inmate costs, $4 million for contract beds, $5 million for fuel and utilities costs and $292,600 for body cameras. Fox Lake Correctional Institution would get 2.1 million in funding and 16 health care related positions. 
Democrats on the committee said the money allocated wouldn’t be enough to lay the groundwork for major reforms to Wisconsin’s correctional system, including shutting down the GBCI. They had introduced a motion that would have added $268.9 million in spending to corrections and 59 staff positions.
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) noted that previous budgets have spent more on incarceration than on the state’s public universities, and that Republicans’ proposal is half of what Democrats wanted to spend on community reentry. 
“Wisconsin is woefully behind the times when it comes to public safety reform and on criminal justice reform,” Roys said. “What’s disappointing about this is to see that we are going to continue to fall far behind. We spend so much money incarcerating people, and that means less money for all the other important things that we want to do in the state.”
Centers dedicated to community reentry will get an additional $1 million under Republican’s proposal.
The centers, Roys said, are a “proven way to reduce recidivism” meaning “reducing the crime as people move back into society.” She also added that the proposal included “no money for supported housing, which we know is one of the biggest barriers for people who are coming out of incarceration and re-entering the community.” 
Roys told reporters after the meeting that the state is incarcerating too many people, and said Evers’ plan would have helped address policy changes that need to be made to progress towards closing GBCI. 
“We don’t have the capacity and the programming and the staffing and the facilities to allow people to successfully reenter and we’re also taking [people] back out of the community after they’ve already re-entered for really minor technical violations. There are a lot of different things that we can safely do to help reduce and right size the prison population… The governor has proposed these things,” Roys said. “Republicans would rather have a talking point and try to portray themselves as tough on crime, when really what they are is very stupid and wasteful on crime.” 
Born said the budget proposal voted on Tuesday was focused on the services already provided by the state and not inserting policy into the budget. He said the committee was doing what it needed to to invest in public safety.
“It’s super expensive, and it is what it is because it is a super important part of public safety,” Born said. “Nothing to be sad or upset about and as I would hope most folks know the discussion on the future is in the [capital budget].” 
The committee also took up the budgets for district attorneys and public defenders. 
The Republican proposal approved on Tuesday adds 42 new assistant district attorney positions, costing $3.5 million in 2025-26 and $2.7 million in 2026-27. The counties with the most new positions include Brown with seven new positions, Waukesha with six positions and Fond du Lac with four. Milwaukee County would get no new positions and Dane County would get one additional position.

Republican lawmakers on the committee said the proposal was based on a workload analysis of the Wisconsin District Attorneys Association and should bring the state up to 80% of the staffing in the study. Roys disputed this, noting that Evers based his proposal on the same study, finding that 47 positions would be needed to bring the staffing to 70%.
Roys said the motion was a “nod in the right direction” but said it was missing commensurate increases for public defenders.
“You can have prosecutors charging and charging and charging all day, but if you don’t have defense attorneys, then people are going to languish in jail,” Roys said. “These cases are going to continue to sit there and not get resolved, and we’re going to see that backlog increase.” 
Roys also criticized the motion for including no new positions for Milwaukee County, the state’s most populous county, and only one new position in Dane County, the second most populous county. She also expressed concern that Republicans were not considering that federal funds that are currently supporting 30 assistant district attorneys across 28 counties are set to be expended in July. 
“The loss of federal funding, I think in some counties, this is going to be very problematic,” Roys said. 
“It’s like a 10% increase. What other agencies here are we giving a 10% increase?” Born said. “This is a priority. This is a key investment. I think it’s a positive thing that we were able to do there, but I’m not gonna cry over all our buddies that got ARPA money, [but] didn’t get it now.”
The positions would be anticipated to start in October.
The Republican motion also included investments of nearly $2 million in 2025-26 and nearly $4 million in 2026-27 for pay progression increase for assistant district attorney and deputy district attorneys. The State Public Defender’s office would get $1.9 million in 2025-26 and $3.8 million in 2026-27 for pay progression.
Other investments for district attorneys and public defenders included $3.5 million to upgrade the case tracking system for prosecutors and $858,400 and $922,4000 and 12.5 positions to address workload issues.
The committee also took up the portions of the budget for the Department of Military Affairs, the Public Service Commission and the budget management. 
UW budget delayed as deadline approaches
The committee did not take up the budget for the University of Wisconsin system, even though it had been scheduled. 
Marklein said leaders “decided not to take it up today” and the co-chairs declined to comment on rumors that lawmakers were preparing a significant cut to the system’s budget.
Roys said she had also heard that Republicans were preparing an $87 million cut to the system and said it would be a “non-starter” for Democrats on the committee.
“The university over the last generation has seen their budget shrink and shrink. They have not gotten inflationary increases, and they’ve had cuts,” said Roys, whose district includes the UW-Madison campus. “What they had asked for in this budget session would help make them whole from the cuts that they have endured over the last 15 years.” 
Roys also said that she thought Republicans were having “difficulty deciding whether they want to walk the plank on making cuts to education.” 
“When we do not fund public education, which is again the No. 1 thing that Wisconsinites have asked for consistently over the years, we are going to end up with a state where nobody wants to live,” Roys said. “We can fund prisons all we want, but ultimately, funding early childhood, funding education, funding higher [education] is how we make Wisconsin a great place to live.”
Marklein said he and his colleagues are trying to get the budget passed before the June 30 deadline. 
Republicans will be facing a small vote margin if they try to pass the bill with only Republican support. Two members of the Senate have already expressed concerns about the budget crafted so far by the Joint Finance Committee. 
Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) said that he sees three options: accepting Evers’ budget, approving the one being drafted by the Joint Finance Committee or leaving the current budget in place. 
“Unless something improves, I am going with option #3,” Kapenga wrote. 
Kapenga said the JFC budget so far includes “unnecessary spending without any reforms that would improve the budget process or dig into wasteful spending currently in place” and said that it would be a major risk to send the budget to Evers because the state Supreme Court hasn’t curbed his veto power.
Kapenga said letting the current budget stand would mean “the lowest spending increase in a decade” and would “have no veto pen risk.” 
Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) had already encouraged the state Legislature last month to either pass no new budget or “a very small mini-budget.” He has a history of voting against the state budget.

(Photo by Tom Werner/Getty Images)(This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)Oklahoma ranked 49th in the nation for its state health care system, according to a report released Wednesday. 
The Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation supporting independent health care research, reported that only Texas and Mississippi trailed Oklahoma. D.C. was also included in the report. 
Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the foundation, said the 2025 scorecards show “incredible progress” around the country but also underscore the “peril that lies ahead.” 
“In addition to the importance of federal policy, it is clear that state policy matters as well,” Betancourt said. “I’m a primary care doctor. I see patients every week and people across the nation can tell you that there is no substitute for being able to get the care you need when you need it. And the evidence is clear that policies that make health insurance and health care more affordable and accessible work and make a difference for people everywhere every day.”
The scorecards use the most recently available data, said David Radley, a senior scientist at the Commonwealth Fund. This year’s report generally reflects the state of health and experiences in 2023, he said. 
Oklahoma performed worst in breast cancer deaths and people with medical debt in collections, but best on primary care spending for seniors. 
Oklahoma is 48th in access and affordability to health care, with Nevada, Mississippi and Texas the only states ranked lower. The state also ranks 46th in racial health equity as well as prevention and treatment. 
Ranked 25th for drug overdose, Oklahoma has over 32 deaths per 100,000 people. 
Oklahoma is ranked 50th for breast cancer deaths and 42nd for infant mortality. 
There are nearly 22 suicides per 100,000 people in Oklahoma, bringing the state a ranking of 46. 
Oklahoma was ranked in the bottom five states for premature deaths from treatable and preventable causes. 
In 2024, a report from the Commonwealth Fund found that Oklahoma’s maternal mortality was one of the worst in the country at 48th. 
Rates of uninsured people dropped in all states, which was likely because of expansions to Medicaid, subsidized coverage and consumer protections, according to a news release. But these improvements could be “reversed” by proposed federal policy changes cutting Medicaid. 
“My hope is that these findings serve as a guide and a call to action for policymakers to make sure everyone in America can get the care they need, no matter who they are, where they live, or how much money they earn,” Betancourt said.

(Read more about this here).
Both the House and Senate took initial votes to back legislation (LD 1770) that would establish a task force to study the challenge of property tax reform. As an emergency measure, the bill must gain the support of two-thirds of each chamber to take effect immediately. (Read about the bill here).
Legislation (LD 1263) that would have created a Class A crime for aggravated trafficking of fentanyl when it results in an overdose is effectively dead after the chambers were unable to agree, with the Senate in support of an amended version and the House opposed. 
Following the Senate on Monday, the House Tuesday voted to pass a resolve (LD 244) directing the Department of Corrections to contract with a community-based organization to establish a transitional housing pilot program to provide for individuals recently released from correctional facilities.
An amended version of LD 1126, which would require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns that are assembled at home or those made with a 3D printer, passed both chambers after the Senate voted 17-18 to reject an effort to pass a different amendment on Tuesday that would only focus on guns used in a crime or in possession of a prohibited person.
With the House voting 77-70 and the Senate 19-15, both chambers backed a measure (LD 1189) that would allow an attorney for the state to determine whether to charge certain class E crimes — unusually punishable by up to six months incarceration and a $1,000 fine — as civil violations.
After the House voted 75-72 on Tuesday, both chambers have now passed legislation (LD 1937) that would require hospitals and hospital-affiliated providers to establish financial assistance programs for medical care. Critics said the bill would add to the burden on struggling hospitals, but supporters argued it would help low income Mainers access medical care without the burden of insurmountable debt. 
After both chambers initially backed a bill (LD 978) to increase the state’s General Assistance reimbursement for municipalities and Indian Tribes, the Senate voted to reconsider and send the legislation back to the health committee, which the House ultimately agreed to do. 
Both the House and Senate backed a provision (LD 1665) that would increase the property tax fairness credit.
LD 953, which sought to align Maine’s definition with the federal definition of a machine gun, was ultimately rejected by both chambers. Critics said they were concerned the change would prohibit any potential future bump stock bans.
With the House voting 75-72 Tuesday, both chambers now passed LD 1867, which prohibits financial institutions and merchants from using firearm codes to track purchases.
A majority of senators and representatives voted to allow Hemphill Farms in Presque Isle to sue the state (LD 1667) over allegations the Department of Conservation, Agriculture and Forestry improperly inspected their seed potato, which they say led to the spread of Bacterial Ring Rot among their customers.
The vast majority of the House (135-12) and Senate (21-14) backed a bill (LD 1228) that would clarify certain terms in the Automotive Right to Repair Laws passed by citizen’s initiative in November 2023. While some lawmakers who voted against the measure argued it was disrespecting the will of the voters, Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick) argued it’s the role of the Legislature to implement the will of the voters. “While slogans win elections, they don’t make good law,” she said.
Nonconcurrence
Members of the House voted 77-69 in support of a proposal (LD 1270) to make the governor’s energy office a cabinet level department and later voted to pass a floor amendment related to labor standards. However, the majority of the Senate (16-19) opposed the measure and then tabled the bill. (Read more about this proposal here).
The House on Tuesday voted 81-67 in favor of LD 556, which would prohibit a municipality from banning a particular energy system or distributor, splitting from the Senate, which rejected the measure. Critics said the measure threatens home-rule and that municipalities should be able to ban dirty fuels. However, supporters argued people shouldn’t be told how to heat their homes.
The majority of the House voted in favor of legislation (LD 532) that would expand state law related to assault on emergency room workers to include all health care workers. The Senate later voted to indefinitely postpone the bill, leaving it in limbo.
House action
Members of the House voted 70-77 against passage of a bill ( LD 746) that would permit municipalities to impose a 2% sales tax on short-term lodging, if approved by referendum, to be used to fund affordable housing. (Read more about this bill here.)

Long before Yellowstone became the world’s first national park in 1872, wolves thrived in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
But early Yellowstone rangers killed off the last of the park’s wolves by 1926. By the late 1930s, the federal government had basically eradicated all the wolves in the American West.
That fundamentally changed the ecosystem, as far as Smith is concerned.
“To me it was just pretty scenery because it wasn’t ecologically vibrant,” Smith said.  
Then, in 1995, the U.S. government reintroduced wolves to Idaho and Yellowstone using wolves captured in Canada. 
Smith helped bring them back to the park and was in charge of Yellowstone’s wolf project for nearly 30 years until he retired in 2022.
“Yellowstone is a very different place, with and without wolves,” Smith said.
“Wolves definitely have changed this landscape with the help of other predators,” he added. “It’s very different.”
Many of the changes have to do with the wolves’ status as an apex predator, at the top of the food chain. With the loss of wolves and the decline of other predators like cougar and grizzly bears, elk populations surged, Smith said.

Without the threat of wolves throughout much of the 20th century, the elk devoured woody vegetation in Yellowstone, like willows and stands of white bark Aspen trees.
When wolves were reintroduced, they preyed on elk, which reduced the number of elk and put pressure on the remaining animals to keep moving and not graze as long or as heavily in one place.
“I go to willow stands and aspen stands now that I was in 30 years ago, and literally, every single stem was eaten by an elk, and it was at the level of your knee,” Smith said. “And now I go in those stands, and you can lose your partner in them in regrowth of vegetation within 10 feet.”
Scientists debate an effect called the trophic cascade, which deals with how ecosystems are constructed and describes the cascading impact a predator has on its prey further down the food chain.
“Why it’s interesting is when European settlers moved across North America, they killed all the predators,” Smith said. “So you’ve really disrupted this process of a trophic cascade.”
Smith said the debate over the effects of the trophic cascade gets complicated – quickly. He himself falls somewhere in the middle when it comes to buying into the impact and intensity of the effect. But as Smith backpacked near Cache Creek in the northern section of Yellowstone, he said the impact of wolves and other predators is easy to spot. 
“You guys don’t have to be ecologists to see all these Aspen are young,” Smith said. “Within a few years – and, man, give them 20 or 30 (years) – you’re going to have a forest here, and we’re going to be standing in the shade. Totally different ballgame, and I think that’s restoring balance to the ecosystem.”
When vegetation grows back, as the aspen and willows grow tall, that impacts things like beaver populations, which Smith has documented, and even songbirds.
The big picture for Smith? Wolves restored balance that was missing from Yellowstone’s ecosystem when the predators were absent.
“It’s a nice story, too,” Smith said. “We ruined Yellowstone. We’re fixing it by bringing back the top carnivores, most notably wolves.”

During Episode 3 we hike into Yellowstone’s backcountry to see the changes in the ecosystem. And we take a deeper dive into the trophic cascade with Doug Smith, who headed up Yellowstone’s wolf program for nearly 30 years. 
 



Truth be told, most Yellowstone visitors have likely never heard of the trophic cascade or deeply  considered the wolves’ impact on the food chain and the larger ecosystem.
But like the ecosystem, wolves have a powerful effect on many people, too. 
Reintroducing wolves also attracted a new crop of tourists hoping to see a wolf in the wild. And that has had a cascading effect on the local economy.
Wolf-watching tourism has an estimated $80 million total economic impact on the communities surrounding Yellowstone National Park.
Any visitor to the wolves’ stronghold in the park, the Lamar Valley, can see the impact in the many tourists dotting hillsides looking through binoculars and spotting scopes hoping to spot canis lupus in the wild. 
And one wolf, in particular, fascinated wolf watchers for longer than almost any other.
 907: the one-eyed the queen of Yellowstone wolves




Even from a great distance, the old wolf’s large size and limp gave her identity away.
Gray, with a black nose, white legs, a cream-colored belly and a black spot near the base of her tail, wolf 907F stood out from the pack.  
907’s physical scars told the silent story of the struggles wolves endure fighting for control of the rugged Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park. 
Aside from a limp in her front paw, 907 was missing her left eye, the result of an injury park officials first noticed in 2017.

“Whatever tragedy, setback or loss she has, she just keeps on moving forward,” said Rick McIntyre, a retired Yellowstone National Park ranger and author who has studied 907’s pack since it formed.

“Nothing (stops her) – not health problems, getting beat up by a rival, the loss of her mother, the loss of her father, loss of pups,” McIntyre said.
Nobody in the world has seen more wolves in the wild than McIntyre.
He started working at Yellowstone in 1994 as an interpretive wolf ranger and documented his 100,000th wolf sighting in 2019.
Because he has 30 years of experience documenting wolves on a nearly daily basis, it takes a lot for a wolf to stand out to McIntyre.

But 907 accomplished something rare. 
She was able to rise to the rank of alpha female four separate times and control one of the largest wolf packs ever documented in Yellowstone. And while she was at it, 907  gave birth to more litters of pups than any wolf ever studied in Yellowstone and outlasted her rivals long enough to grow old in the wild.
In 2024, 907 turned 11 years old and continued to lead hunts for bison and elk as the oldest wolf in the national park.
By comparison, the average wolf lives for about three or four years in Yellowstone, McIntyre said. Even pet dogs that sleep indoors, receive veterinary care and have a bowl of food waiting for them twice a day don’t always make it to 11.
Because of her longevity and the fact that researchers put a radio collar on her when she was a pup, Yellowstone biologists and wolf watchers were able to study 907 so closely for so long that there are detailed numbers and statistics documenting much of her life. 
For her to reach the age of 11, 907 had to defend her territory from rival wolves and endure 10 snowy, freezing Wyoming winters. She had to fight for most of her meals – sometimes getting kicked in the head by 2,000-pound bison and sent flying through the air.
Her stats are a snapshot of the turbulent life wild wolves face. Throughout her life, Yellowstone National Park staff watched 907 participate in 566 hunts. 
Most of the time she chased bison (281 hunts) or elk (239 times). 
She was successful 33 times, or in about 6% of the hunts that park officials documented.
Yellowstone officials once watched 907 and the Junction Butte Pack endure 12 days without finding anything to eat – only for the pack to triumphantly bring down a bull elk on empty stomachs.
When it comes to numbers, the biggest impact 907 may have had was building up the bloodline of Yellowstone wolves.
In 2024, at the age of 11, she produced her 10th litter of pups. 
That is the most for any wolf in 30 years of wolf research at Yellowstone National Park.
“With her being 11 years old and having new pups that would be somewhat similar to a woman in her mid 80s having kids,” McIntyre said.
Numbers even tell the story of how 907 got her name.
When Yellowstone officials captured 907 and placed a radio collar around her neck in 2013, she got collar No. 907.
Each collar has a unique number to help identify and tell the wolves apart. Biologists use the “F” in 907F to designate her as female, but many people simply called her 907.
The collar allowed park officials to keep close tabs on 907 for more than a decade.
Many of the numbers and statistics about 907 can be found online in the 2024 Yellowstone Wolf, Cougar and Elk Project annual report, as well as previous yearly wolf reports.

Wolf 907 and the Junction Butte Pack’s territory spanned mountains, valleys and creeks within an area called the Lamar Valley, which is in the northern part of Yellowstone National Park on the Wyoming-Montana border. It’s one of the centers of wildlife activity in the park.
For years, 907 dug her den into a hillside covered by a mix of sagebrush and conifer trees overlooking Slough Creek, where 907 and her pack hunted bison and elk.



On a chilly July morning in 2024, the creek meandered through a giant meadow below the den, where bison wallowed as the morning sun crested the nearby mountain peaks. 
The den was a mile or more from the closest road, near the top of a diagonal section of forest. 
Toward the left side of the forest, barely visible to the naked eye from more than a mile away, stood four small clusters of conifer trees. 
At the base of one of the trees, near a patch of light colored dirt, 907 wrestled with two pups, one gray and one black
Unbeknownst to 907, she was often the object of attention from afar. 
And on that morning in July a handful of people with high-powered scopes were watching her every move.
One of the wolf watchers was Laurie Lyman, a schoolteacher originally from California.

Lyman became interested in wolves after realizing that third and fourth graders became more interested in learning about continents if Lyman described the animals that lived there.
One year, Lyman received a copy of Jim Dutcher’s 1997 Emmy Award-winning documentary “Wolves at Our Door,” which Lyman and her students promptly fell in love with.
Something about wolves – how they live in packs that function like a family, where all of the wolves help raise the pups, contribute to hunting and share food – made an immediate impression on Lyman.
Within wolf packs, including 907’s own Junction Butte Pack, biologists have even documented one wolf raising another wolf’s pups. One spring, 907 had a litter of eight pups. Other female members of the Junction Butte Pack who lost their own litters helped 907 raise her large litter  – even taking turns nursing the pups.
Before reintroduction, Lyman was fascinated by the ways the members of wolf packs worked together to take care of each other.
But wolves had been absent from the landscape in the U.S. Rocky Mountains for her entire life, and Lyman assumed she would never see a wolf in the wild.
That’s how wolf reintroduction changed Lyman’s life.
After wolves were reintroduced in 1995, Lyman started hearing about people seeing wild wolves again and she made a trip to see what it was all about.
“When they released them into Yellowstone, when they started to see them, it was incredible, and that was the changing point in my life,” Lyman said.
Lyman retired from teaching in 2005 and bought a house in Montana just outside of Yellowstone’s Northeast Entrance to be closer to wolves.
She became friends with then-Yellowstone Ranger Rick McIntyre and purchased a spotting scope. And for the past 20 years, Lyman has been watching wolves and documenting her sightings online at www.yellowstonereports.com.
Now, she thinks of wolves and wolf packs a lot like students and classrooms.
“It’s very similar to actually teaching my kids, watching the wolves out,” Lyman said. “It’s like watching a recess. Because you have the adults sleeping. And you have the yearlings playing.  And you have the pups and it’s very much like kids in a sandbox, kids playing soccer. And then the older kids sitting in the lunch center talking.”
“My thing is getting to know them on an individual basis, so that I can easily recognize them,” Lyman added.

 If you come at the queen, you best not miss

Thanks to their notes and years of daily field observations, McIntyre and Lyman have major details of 907’s life documented.
Even as a pup, 907 didn’t have it easy.
She was born in 2013, the second year of the Junction Butte Pack’s existence. Before the year was over, 907’s mother died or disappeared, McIntyre said. About that same time, 907’s father, wolf 911, took off, returning to the original wolf pack that he had been born into.
“In human terms, you could say that she was orphaned,” McIntyre said. “However, she was raised by the pack, raised by the family.”
After she became an adult, 907 fought with her twin sister, wolf 969, for control of the Junction Butte Pack.
The two sisters regularly pinned each other to the ground and bit at each other, Lyman said. 
“And they went back and forth several times on who had the alpha female position,” McIntyre said. “907 would have it for a while, the sister would take it away from her and then 907 would get it back.”
In 2017, 907 had a litter of pups and made her den in a remote location away from the rest of the Junction Butte Pack. 
Park officials and wolf watchers noticed that the other adults in the pack stayed away from the den and didn’t appear to bring food to 907 or her pups.

In May, 907 returned to the pack, but her pups had died.
“And to make it worse, while she was desperately trying to save her pups, her sister at the time, 969, took advantage of that situation to seize the alpha position,” McIntyre said. “And when 907 rejoined the pack after losing all of her pups, she was beaten up by her sister and relegated to a very lowly position in the pack.”
“Everything that year was against her,” McIntyre said. 
Even though she was relegated to a subordinate role, 907 didn’t leave the pack.

“She just has this ability to keep on moving forward, rather than dwelling on the past, dwelling on how unfair life has been,” McIntyre said. 
During the 2019-20 winter, the Junction Butte Pack experienced a bloody leadership shakeup.
The female wolves aggressively drove 969 – 907’s sister and rival – out of the pack.
Wolf 969 survived her initial expulsion, but park officials noticed she appeared to be in poor physical condition. 
A few weeks after her exile, 969 encountered the Junction Butte Pack again one January night, leading to a fight.
“The next morning 969F was seen with injuries and she died later that day,” officials wrote in the Yellowstone Wolf Project’s 2020 annual report. “Her injuries were caused by other wolves and she weighed only 33 kilograms (73 pounds).”
Even after her sister and closest rival was killed, 907 continued to face challenges from rival female wolves.
First, it was her sister’s daughter, wolf 1382, who became a problem for 907.
Then wolf 1262 took over as the pack’s alpha female.
Finally it was wolf 1276.
But after 1276 was last seen alive in October 2023, 907 again took her crown as the Junction Butte Pack’s alpha female.
“And this is her fourth term as alpha female, meaning that she lost it three times,” McIntyre said. “And in those cases, it was either to a sister or a niece. So she’s had a lot of hard times in her life, and she’s always been able to fight back and prevail.”
From 2016 to 2024, 907 claimed the rank of alpha female four separate times.
And she gave birth to pups every spring from 2015 to 2024.

For those reasons, Lyman views 907 as the stabilizing force in the Junction Butte Pack and one of her favorite wolves of all time.
“She would just put her head down and walk into the wind no matter what adversity came to her,” Lyman said.
 Ambushed in the dark, a queen makes her last stand in Yellowstone 

Despite her long rivalry with her sister, it turns out 907’s greatest threat came from outside her own pack.
It was just before Christmas 2024 when 907 made her last stand.
During the final few weeks of 2024, the Junction Butte Pack left the invisible, unfenced boundary of Yellowstone National Park and entered Montana, where hunting season was underway.
From Dec. 17 through Dec. 19, hunters legally killed two other adult members of the Junction Butte Pack outside of the park, Yellowstone officials wrote. 
After the shootings, 907 and some of the surviving members of the Junction Butte Pack returned to their home territory in the Lamar Valley inside of Yellowstone.

But the Junction Butte Pack’s numbers were reduced. Lyman said there were only six other wolves with 907 when the final battle went down – and one or two of them may have been pups.
A much larger force of 19 wolves from a different wolf pack, the Rescue Creek Pack, ambushed 907 and the Junction Butte Pack on Dec. 22 after wolf watchers spotted the diminished Junction Butte Pack feeding on an animal carcass.
The attack occurred at night.
Lyman wasn’t there, but she received a phone call from a friend who was.
“She was filming and her camera lights things up so she could see things pretty well,” Lyman said. “She called me and she said, ‘You know, it’s over. They got her.’”
The radio collar 907 was wearing was designed to enter mortality mode and emit a unique signal after several hours passed without any movement from the wolf. Officials didn’t detect a mortality signal from 907 until about three days after the attack, Lyman said.

Lyman was heartbroken thinking about 907 suffering at the end.
It may be impossible to know exactly what went down in the dark woods after the Rescue Creek Pack advanced on 907 and the Junction Butte Pack.
But this much seems certain.
907 went out fighting.
She died fighting a larger, rival wolf pack that had attacked her and the Junction Butte Pack – the family she lived with her entire life with.
No other members of the Junction Butte Pack died in the attack from the Rescue Creek wolves.
That means 907’s pack, including some of her pups and nieces, lived on without her. 
Strange as it sounds, Lyman takes comfort in that.
Despite the sadness, people like Lyman were happy that 907 lived and died naturally, as wolves did before humans became a factor. 
At least 907 wasn’t shot by hunters, like 15 other members of the Junction Butte Pack who were killed when they strayed outside of the park’s boundaries, Lyman said. 
The same week 907 died, her counterpart, the alpha male of the Junction Butte Pack, was killed by a poacher. The alpha male, who did not have a number or a radio collar, was killed Dec. 24, while the wolf was outside of Yellowstone National Park, in Montana. 
After living to be the fifth-oldest wolf ever recorded in Yellowstone and having more litters of pups than any Yellowstone wolf since the species was reintroduced 30 years ago, 907 went out fighting. 
“This is a wolf in the wild, and this is what wolves do,” Lyman said. “They’re wired to rise to the top to survive, and this is what they have to do to do it.”
“She just did what she had to do to make sure that her pack survived,” Lyman said. “So to me, she is a key to the Junctions surviving until now. And her legacy is in those three females that are left there in the pack.”
That’s one of the gifts of a wolf, Lyman said. 
“Just like a regular family does, you pass down what you know and help them learn to survive. And she really did that.”

(Getty Images)A settlement with Indiana coal producers, announced Tuesday, could lead to third-party operation of coal units at Duke Energy Indiana’s Cayuga Generating Station.
In a news release, President Stan Pinegar said the agreement with trade association Reliable Energy “is aligned with” coal-focused executive action from Gov. Mike Braun.
The utility’s request to spend an estimated $3.3 billion — or $5.3 billion with financing costs — on new gas units at Cayuga is still pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

The project would add more than 470 megawatts to the aging facility’s 1005-megawatt capacity. After more than 55 years in operation, Cayuga is the oldest coal-fired facility left in Duke’s Hoosier portfolio.
The utility previously planned to replace and retire the existing coal units.
But now — if regulators approve the plan — Duke has agreed to perform an engineering study to evaluate the technical feasibility of continued operation of the coal units by third parties that may be interested in purchasing them.
Duke would issue a request for proposal to solicit interest in the coal units, which could be available for sale after the two proposed gas units are operational in 2029 and 2030, according to the news release.
“The settlement is aligned with (Braun’s) recent executive orders aimed at making sure there’s a careful evaluation before retiring coal units and encouraging additions to the state’s power supplies,” Pinegar said. “The new natural gas units we’ve proposed add additional, highly efficient power capacity to Indiana’s electric grid.”
Reliable Energy President Savannah Kerstiens said the agreement is a “meaningful step toward preserving reliable, in-state power generation for Hoosiers.”
She praised Braun and Indiana Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski for their leadership, remarking that their “continued commitment to Indiana’s energy resilience made this outcome achievable.”
“As the state works to attract new investment and grow the economy, ensuring affordable electricity for working families means keeping every option on the table to maintain generation capacity,” Kerstiens added.
Age: not just a number
Cayuga’s coal units were built with estimated 30-year lifespans and have already operated for almost twice as long as expected, according to rebuttal testimony Pinegar filed late last month.
They “have reached the end of their useful lives from the Company’s perspective,” he wrote.
Performing the upgrades needed to further extend those lifespans “overlooks the additional maintenance required and increased reliability issues experienced by aging generating units,” Pinegar continued.
He added that Cayuga’s coal units have been and remain at risk of being derated due to operational constraints like river water temperature.
Ratepayer protection agency recommends against Duke’s coal-to-gas push

“We believe retirement of the units is in the best interest of our customers. That Duke Energy Indiana plans to permanently cease generating electricity from the Cayuga coal units, however, does not necessarily mean these units must cease operations altogether,” Pinegar wrote.
Duke plans to repurpose many of the coal-related assets to “reduce costs for customers.”
But if a third party does want to take over the coal units, it would be responsible for procuring the interconnection, air permit, and other assets required to continue or restart operations.
Such activities “can and should be done without impacting affordability for our existing retail customers,” per Pinegar’s rebuttal testimony.
If the natural gas project is approved, Duke estimates that the first tracker filed would add $1.87 to the typical residential customer’s monthly bill.
But that amount would rise as construction continues; the state agency tasked with protecting utility consumers estimated a total impact of $19.37 monthly. The Office of Utility Consumer Counselor in May asked regulators to reject the plan, which it described as “ill-advised.”
Duke contends the pay-as-you-go approach will “smooth out” the impact to customers and save them an estimated $812 million over the life of the revamped facility.

,WyoFile,2025-06-18 10:25:00+00:00,WyoFile,"Wyoming worker exodus threatens economic decline, business council says",Dustin Bleizeffer,,,,,https://wyofile.com/wyoming-worker-exodus-threatens-economic-decline-business-council-says/,"

The state agency proposes ""major"" reforms to a business loan program, and a broader discussion on Wyoming's economic future.
The post Wyoming worker exodus threatens economic decline, business council says appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming is experiencing a workforce exodus that will set the state on a long-term economic decline unless it grapples with how to enable communities to attract quality, knowledge-based jobs to compete with surrounding states, the Wyoming Business Council’s top officials say.
“What we’re finding is that, by and large, the [job] opportunities in Wyoming are not good enough, and there aren’t enough of them to retain our youth,” the council’s CEO, Josh Dorrell, told WyoFile. “It’s actually not just the youth. We noticed that our out-migration was twice that of the national average, where we have more out-migration than any other state.”
Some 60% to 70% of Wyoming-born residents permanently leave the state by the time they are 30, according to analysis prepared for the business council. Businesses looking to expand or open up shop in the state report that the available workforce is their No. 1 constraint, creating a “chicken-and-egg” crisis that will require several strategies to overcome, Dorrell said, including — potentially — reforming Wyoming’s tax-and-revenue system currently built around its extractive industries.

Wyoming Business Council CEO Josh Dorrell.
“They want places that have a vibrant workforce,” Dorrell said. “They don’t want a lot of the things that we think are important, like low taxes. Very rarely, if ever, do we hear a company say, ‘We like you because of your low taxes.’ It just doesn’t happen.”
The business council began ringing alarm bells in May when it was scheduled to appear before the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee. It prepared a presentation highlighting the problem, “long-term economic decline in Wyoming,” and proposed policy changes to address it. The committee ran out of time to hear the business council and rescheduled the discussion for its next meeting July 29-30 in Casper.
Reformations
Wyoming’s long-beleaguered tax-and-revenue system that stunts economic growth is at the root of the problem, according to both the business council and the Wyoming Association of Municipalities. That’s a larger conversation for lawmakers, they say. For its part, the council wants to reform its own Business Ready Community grant and loan program.
The program, which typically requires a small match, is intended to help towns and counties fund business-related infrastructure, like extending water and sewer to business parks. But it has proven ineffective in the face of increasing competition for businesses that require a skilled workforce for knowledge-based jobs, according to Dorrell and his team. 
From 2004 to 2019, more than $416 million has been granted to support 396 projects across the state. “And what we found,” Dorrell said, “is that it has not made the difference that it should have.”
Wyoming’s gross domestic product has lagged behind neighboring states. (Wyoming Business Council)
What’s needed are projects that enable businesses to tap into infrastructure and that improve the quality of life throughout the community. The focus, Dorrell said, should be more broadly rooted in community-wide resiliency. Rawlins, for example, can extend water lines to a business center, but that wouldn’t fix the town’s larger need to modernize its water system throughout the community where workers would live.
That particular concept “is on the right track, fundamentally,” Wyoming Association of Municipalities Executive Director Ashley Harpstreith said. “If you’re looking at the core of what government should be doing to be ready for businesses, it does come back to infrastructure and adequately funding our infrastructure.”
But the other reforms the business council proposes for the program will be hard to swallow for towns and counties. The council proposes increasing the grant and loan program’s required match to a minimum of 25%. The purpose, according to the business council, is to entice communities to raise more of their own revenue via the optional sales tax and mill levies.
“When we put a little pressure on leaders in our communities, they always rise to the occasion,” Wyoming Business Council Chief Strategy Officer Sarah Fitz-Gerald said. Raising the match requirement will force local leaders to engage more closely with residents about how they want to secure their economic future and, ideally, result in smarter business projects, Fitz-Gerald added.
Harpstreith doesn’t necessarily disagree with the premise, she said. But local governments have long struggled to increase their revenues via optional sales taxes and mills. Communities are even in a tighter pinch now that lawmakers slashed property taxes by 25%.
“I just think it’s going to highlight, honestly, the inability for locals to raise funds right now in these trying times,” Harpstreith said. “But I also think, on the positive side, it does really realign the [Business Ready Community] program the way I think it was initially intended.”Click here to learn more about the business council’s proposed rules changes regarding the Business Ready Community program.

The arc of human history on our planet has been one of conquest, columnist Rod Miller opines. 
The post We are all standing on stolen land appeared first on WyoFile .","I got some pushback on my last column for not calling the public lands in the United States “stolen land.” I’ll clarify that misunderstanding in this column.

Opinion

As you read this, you are occupying stolen land. No matter where you are in the world, you are standing on stolen land. No matter which continent, no matter who you are.
Every acre, every square inch of the planet Earth has changed hands at some time in history, most often by violence. That is simply the nature of history. That is the nature of humanity. And, no matter how you wish it were otherwise, or how wrong you think it is, there’s nothing you can do to change that fact.
This will not be my most popular column. Many of you will misconstrue this rant as either a liberal or a conservative viewpoint. It’s not, it’s history. You likely don’t want to hear this, and you will probably be outraged. But you are standing on stolen land.
This reality is helping to drive the protests in Los Angeles and elsewhere. We are seeing an outburst of emotional indignation by those rising up against ICE and that agency’s actions to deport undocumented immigrants from Mexico. Waving Mexican flags, protesters claim that California was “stolen” from Mexico.
California was not stolen; it was purchased in 1848 by the United States at the end of the Mexican-American War. But it was purchased from a nation that had “stolen” it from prior occupants, who had themselves stolen it from previous “owners.”
By violence. By being more powerful.
This is the same dynamic at work in the Middle East today, between Israel and the current and former occupants of Palestine. The same forces were at work in the 20th Century when European colonial powers lost their grip on Africa.
Go back further in history, to the “barbarian” conquest of the Roman Empire, to the Persian incursion northward into Greece. Go back further to the Neanderthal supplanting the Cro-Magnon. History is full of examples of people conquering people who conquered other people. Since humans walked out of Africa on two legs, this has been how we have behaved.
The arc of human history on our planet has been one of conquest. For a hundred millennia, humans of all races on all continents have conquered and taken land from fellow humans. Every skin color in the crayon box has stolen land from folks of the same color. They have killed them, enslaved them and sometimes eaten them. Guilt can be placed on no single culture nor any single empire.
Ancient cultures have been swept aside by invaders and lost to memory. Laws, customs, beliefs and knowledge held dear by the conquered people are replaced by those of the interlopers. It must be something in human DNA that makes us do this to one another. Perhaps it is a deeply rooted acquisitiveness in our nature, a lust to exercise power, to dominate and take by force what others own.
And it is perhaps this historic phenomenon that irks people and prompts them to protest a perceived “injustice” and to demand that stolen land be returned to the rightful owners. This, in my opinion, is nothing more than a lazy virtue signal that rolls easily off the tongue when shouted through a bullhorn during a protest. But it turns a blind eye toward reality.
Aside from the impracticality of returning the surface of the Earth to the original “owners,” it begs the uneasy question of to whom it should be returned.
Should the Black Hills, for example, be returned to the Sioux? Or should it be returned to the tribes that the Sioux drove off in order to occupy the Black Hills? Or to the unnamed people who lived there before they were, in turn, driven off?
Who is in a moral position to make that determination?
That conundrum prevails across the face of our planet, because there is nowhere that the original “owners” of the land still control it. Nowhere.
Seen in this light, land reparations are a surrogate issue for something deeper that bothers us. We have in our American nature the genetic makeup of both conquerors and the conquered. All people share that. And what might disturb us the most, might drive us into the streets in protest, is this inconsistency within us, this deep realization that power over others ultimately prevails in our world, no matter how much we might wish otherwise.
As you read this, we all live on stolen land. And the fact of the matter is that we stole it from ourselves. Cassius, in Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar,” nailed it when he said, “The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our stars. But in ourselves, that we are underlings.”

GEORGETOWN – The Sussex County Council has unanimously approved a $285.1 million operating budget for the 2026 fiscal year, marking a significant financial shift as the county adopts its first new property tax rate in decades following a court-mandated reassessment.
The budget, passed after a public hearing on Tuesday night, reflects a 7.3% increase over the current year’s spending plan.
The increase is largely driven by capital investments in wastewater infrastructure and public services. The new fiscal year begins July 1.
A key feature of the 2026 budget is the adjustment of the property tax rate from 44.5 cents to 2.14 cents per $100 of assessed value.
“This is a historic budget in that sense, but it remains true to what has been a familiar theme throughout the years in Sussex County,” County Administrator Todd Lawson said. “And that’s one of providing the highest quality services at the best possible value for our customers.”

Although the rate has dropped dramatically, the move is designed to keep revenues steady after higher property values were assessed during the recent countywide reassessment.
Officials say the change maintains “revenue neutrality,” ensuring the county collects roughly the same amount in property taxes as it did last year.
The budget is funded by a mix of revenue sources, including realty transfer taxes, sewer and water service fees, building permits, and document recording fees. Several of these fees will see modest increases in the coming year.
Budget details
Notable spending highlights include:

$76.7 million for wastewater infrastructure projects, including expansions and upgrades.
$7.4 million for open space and farmland preservation.
An increase in funding for supplemental state police coverage, from $4.6 million to $5.8 million.
$6 million in aid for local fire companies and ambulance squads.
$1.25 million dedicated to affordable housing initiatives.
$2.4 million for planning and constructing new paramedic stations in Dewey Beach, Lincoln, and Milton.

Finance Director Gina A. Jennings emphasized the County’s commitment to balancing rising service demands with fiscal discipline.
County Council President Doug Hudson praised the plan, citing its responsiveness to inflationary pressures and population growth.
“Whether it’s a household budget or a government budget, we all can feel the squeeze of inflation and increasing demand on our pocketbooks and wallets,”  Hudson said. “The Council recognizes that. I’m proud of the work this County does year to year in respecting the value of the taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars, and that’s clearly what’s driving this budget, one that keeps costs in check, but recognizes the ever-changing needs of our growing community.”

Colorado lawmakers from both parties have denounced the politically targeted shootings against Minnesota state lawmakers on June 14, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)More than 40 Colorado elected officials as of Tuesday have requested the redaction of their addresses and other personal information from the state’s online campaign finance database. The Colorado secretary of state suspended the website on Saturday, due to safety concerns in the aftermath of shootings targeting two Minnesota Democratic lawmakers.
Melissa Hortman, the Minnesota House Democratic leader, and her husband Mark Hortman were shot and killed this weekend by a man who came to their home posing as a police officer, federal officials said. Vance Boelter, 57, faces charges for the murders, as well as for the shootings of Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman, who are expected to recover.
Colorado lawmakers have condemned the shootings, and many are taking additional safety precautions. Colorado House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Democrat from Dillon, said in a statement that “what happened in Minnesota has shaken us to our very core.”

“Our democracy is based on the idea that we resolve our differences through peaceful debate and in courts, elected bodies, state legislatures and the halls of Congress, not political violence,” she said.
Colorado Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, said he has “been in close and ongoing communication” with the Colorado State Patrol, and he has adjusted his driving patterns when going to work, for safety reasons.
“This assassination and targeted attack in Minnesota was a tragedy and a disturbing escalation of political violence in our country,” Coleman said in an interview Tuesday. “It’s understandable that legislators are concerned for their safety and the safety of their families. I am for myself and my family.”
Colorado political candidates submit their campaign finance information, which is posted in the online database, known as TRACER, to comply with state election transparency laws. The website includes their home addresses, phone numbers and other personal information. 
The secretary of state is allowing lawmakers to redact personal information online that is not required to be public based on a campaign finance rule that protects “any person who believes their safety or the safety of an immediate family member may be in jeopardy.”
A spokesperson for the Colorado secretary of state’s office said there is not a specific time anticipated for when TRACER will be online again, but it will be “back up soon.”
Colorado House Minority Leader Rose Pugliese, a Colorado Springs Republican, said in a statement about the Minnesota shootings that “violence has no place in our politics. Not now. Not ever.”
“This is an unconscionable act of violence,” Pugliese said. “There is absolutely no justification for targeted attacks on elected officials — or anyone — based on their political beliefs. Our nation was built on civil discourse and the peaceful exchange of ideas, not horrific acts of violence. We are keeping the families of Rep. Hortman and Senator Hoffman in our prayers.”
Coleman called for respect and less negativity in political interactions nationwide. He emphasized that he serves both Democrats and Republicans, and said the safety of all state lawmakers, as well as Coloradans as a whole, is a top priority. 
“I keep my head on a swivel,” Coleman said. “We always need to be aware of our surroundings and not get caught off guard, but we can’t live in fear. We focus on what we can control.”

The four-member committee unanimously approved Senate Bill 54, which would exempt projects from prevailing wage provisions if they were paid for using a bond or bond proposal approved before the state reinstated prevailing wage requirements for publicly funded construction projects.
Three of the four members voted to approve Senate Bill 319, with the committee’s sole Republican member, Sen. Thomas Albert of Lowell, voting against the policy. 
The bill would make staffing levels a mandatory subject amid collective bargaining discussions with police and fire departments. However, if a municipality collected less sales tax and property tax revenue than the previous fiscal year, those discussions are voluntary, rather than required. 
While the bill received support from the Michigan Professional Fire Fighters Union and the Police Officers Association of Michigan during the committee’s previous meeting, the Michigan Sheriffs’ Association, alongside several local government groups and local officials, stood opposed to the policy. 
The Michigan Municipal League cited concerns about the policy’s long term cost, arguing the exemption does not paint an accurate picture of a locality’s funds.
“Contracts are typically multi-year agreements. To take a single look in the year you happen to be negotiating would be fiscally irresponsible. This lookback would not accurately reflect the costs associated with staffing or other contractual costs. …It is an oversimplification and fails to address inflationary trends, contractual raises, health care costs, and the numerous other community expenses,” the League’s Legislative Associate Dave Hodgkins wrote in a letter to the committee.
Both bills await further consideration on the Senate floor.

The daily deliberations about what to have for dinner are a moot point – because there’s only one source of food. For every meal, every day, you dutifully head to the Monopoly Cafe.
At first, this arrangement seemed OK. It’s not the best cafe, but they always spoke of their plans to make it better, cleaner, and serve healthier food. It seems weird that the owners are guaranteed 10% profits every year, even as they make some questionable business decisions. But you stick it out, not wanting to complain. Besides, you have no choice anyway.
There’s no menu at the Monopoly Cafe, you get what’s served and if you don’t like it you can just go home hungry. There’s no option on the price, either – it’s expensive day in and day out. Recently they raised the price a whole lot, claiming they’re just catching up to the market and they won’t need to raise prices again for a while. Well, you can guess what happened next. They raised the prices even more.
And then there’s the food. This stuff is the worst, rubbery gristle you can imagine. Every so often, the management of the Monopoly Cafe holds a few “listening sessions” to get input on the food. Townspeople show up and stand in line to share their ideas. People express their visions for fresh meats, fruits, and vegetables. Our town has abundant potential to grow top-quality natural and local foods, so why aren’t we doing that instead of eating rubbery gristle?
After lengthy consideration, the Monopoly Cafe’s Board of Directors flies into town on their private jets to announce the new menu: More rubbery gristle! You see, there are special state laws that allow the cafe to layer on even more profit for rubbery gristle, so they’re happy to sell you even more of what you don’t want.
The locals are over it. They came up with a nickname for the Monopoly Cafe: The Neighborhood’s Worst Eatery. The name sticks, and soon everyone is referring to the Monopoly by its nickname, “NWE.”
The NWE management has yet another trick to enrich themselves. They toss all the garbage from the restaurant into the ditch behind the cafe. Piles of rotting gristle accumulate in foamy ponds, which overflow into the nearby creek. The creek used to be your town’s drinking water until it became contaminated. Cleaning up that mess is gonna be expensive one day, and you’ll have no choice but to pay for it. But NWE reminds you it’s a small price to pay for the treat of dining on rubbery gristle every day.
Your patience for the Monopoly Cafe is worn thin. You hate to see your kids eating the least healthy food imaginable, and you learn that cafes in other states use locally-grown foods that cost less. How is it possible that you’re stuck with the worst food and the highest prices? Don’t you have any recourse?
Amazingly, you do.
The People Supervising Cafes are in charge of making sure the cafe treats you right. Let’s call them the “PSC” for short.
The state government and the PSC are supposed to rein in the Neighborhood’s Worst Eatery – they can require better food, a cleaner restaurant, and lower prices. But weirdly, they never have. They’ve approved everything NWE asked for, leaving you stuck with the bill and a chronic case of heartburn. To make a bad situation even worse, lately NWE has decided to just go rogue, sidestepping the PSC’s authority and doing whatever they want. They’re betting that no one will stop them.
This metaphor seems outrageous, right? But it illustrates the situation NorthWestern Energy has created. It might feel hopeless but it isn’t. The PSC (Public Service Commission) now has a golden opportunity to rein in NorthWestern Energy.
We’ve all put up with expensive gristle for way too long. It’s time for Montana’s regulators to hold NWE accountable, restore the balance of power, and stop rewarding bad behavior.
Wouldn’t that be delicious?

In a legislative session dominated by the GOP supermajority’s conservative agenda, Tennessee lawmakers this spring took the unusual, bipartisan step of protecting certain reproductive rights.
Beginning July 1, Tennessee will become the first — and only — state in the South to have codified the right to access fertility treatments and birth control into state law.
Introduced by two Republican women and signed into law by Gov. Bill Lee, the legislation protects Tennesseans’ access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and a range of birth control methods — reproductive health options that have not, in modern times, been restricted in the state, but now have safeguards into the future.
Backers of the bill, among them progressive groups and conservative Republicans who have expanded their families through the use of IVF, called the legislation a needed win for preserving access to care.
“The law provides critical stability and peace of mind in an otherwise volatile political environment for women and families,” said Natalie Schilling of AWAKE Tennessee, which advocates for the rights of children and women. 
Despite bipartisan support, however, the legislation was nearly derailed during its last debate on the House floor, a potential signal for future legislative fights that still loom over efforts to restrict access to IVF some Republicans have already indicated they intend to bring next year.
After the bill passed narrowly in the House, 11 Republicans called the legislation a “Trojan horse that could potentially undermine Tennessee’s strong and righteous stance on the protection of innocent human life” in a letter that unsuccessfully sought Lee’s veto of the bill.

The 11th hour pushback caught Rep. Iris Rudder by surprise. Rudder, a Republican from Winchester, cosponsored the legislation with Republican Sen. Becky Massey of Knoxville. 
“I thought it was such a simple bill that said we just want to codify access to contraceptives and IVF,” she said in an interview with the Lookout.  “I had no idea it would mushroom the way it did. It opened my eyes. It really did,” she said. 
The legislation had sailed through legislative committees and earned a unanimous vote from the state Senate. Yet by the time it reached a vote on the House floor in early April, many of its Republican supporters sat silent during debate. 
“I was looking out at the House floor and I was thinking, I am standing here as a woman and this is such an important issue for women,” Rudder said. “Most of those men are married. They have wives. They have daughters. They should be able to understand how important all these conversations are to women.”
‘Here I am asking you guys to get on board’ 
The Fertility Treatment and Contraceptive Protection Act runs just five sentences long:
“The law of this state clearly and unambiguously acknowledges the right of a healthcare provider to perform, and the right of a person to receive or use, fertility treatment and contraceptives in this state,” it says in part. 
The legislation was introduced in the aftermath of a first-of-its kind Alabama Supreme Court decision that jeopardized access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) in that state – and broader concerns that efforts to restrict abortion access could extend to birth control.
Rudder said she brought the legislation after women and families across the state implored her to protect their access to IVF and birth control.
The measure is similar to unsuccessful legislation brought last year by Democrats Rep. Harold Love, Jr. of Nashville and Sen. Raumesh Akbari of Memphis, both Democrats. That bill would have made explicit that Tennessee’s near total abortion ban does not endanger fertility treatments or access to contraceptive care. 










I was looking out at the House floor and I was thinking, I am standing here as a woman and this is such an important issue for women. Most of those men are married. They have wives. They have daughters. They should be able to understand how important all these conversations are to women.


– Rep. Iris Rudder, R-Winchester


Unlike the Democrats’ bill, the Fertility Treatment and Contraceptive Protection Act makes no mention of the word “abortion.”
Rudder supports Tennessee’s near-total abortion ban and considers her legislation a wholly separate issue. During House debate over the bill, however, some Republicans argued the issues are intertwined.  
Rep. Gino Bulso, a Brentwood Republican, unsuccessfully sought to amend the bill to regulate the disposal of unused embryos in IVF treatment to “reaffirm that an embryo is a child.” The legislation, he argued, would create a “right to create and destroy human embryos without qualification, limitation or restriction,” contrary to the state’s recent anti-abortion history.
Republican Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson said he opposed the bill because it would make it difficult for lawmakers to introduce subsequent legislation protecting embryos. 
Rep Chris Todd, a Republican representing Madison county, called the bill “absolutely unnecessary.” He argued the bill would allow for “genetic testing to weed out embryos with undesirable genetic traits.” 
And Rep. Timothy Hill, a Blountville Republican, noted that the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and other groups that support abortion rights supported the legislation, giving him pause. 
“The bottom line is today you cast your vote not with a friend, not with a colleague, but with an organization that stands against life,” he warned colleagues on the House floor ahead of a vote on the legislation.

“Let’s get something the ACLU has a problem with and let’s come back here next year and get it right,” he sid.
Rudder, who stood for nearly 45 minutes in the well of the House defending the bill at times, emotionally, pushed back. She noted that President Donald Trump has signaled his support to protect IVF access. 
“Yes, I am your friend,” she told Republican colleagues. “But I don’t stand here as your friend. I stand here as a woman who believes this is important to families in Tennessee. 
“I stand with women in this state and families in this state that want the ability to have these precious babies they may not have the opportunity to have otherwise.”
Later, she said in an interview with the Lookout, she had been “naive” in thinking the legislation would easily pass muster with all of her Republican colleagues. She said she was grateful that Rep. Esther Helton-Haynes, an East Ridge Republican, stood beside her in the well. “She was the only woman legislator that did,” she said.
“When I walked in there (the House floor), I had 61 votes,” she said. “When I walked out, I had 54.
“The conversation just went in such a different direction,” Rudder said. “When I went into the debate, I just wanted them to know that for women in this state, it’s so important. I was very emotional saying, ‘here I am asking you guys to get on board and understand what this bill actually does.’ I think they missed the point.”

The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

(Photo courtesy of the New Jersey Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson)A state correctional officer was arrested for allegedly accepting bribes to smuggle tobacco and other contraband to people incarcerated at Northern State Prison in Newark, the New Jersey attorney general’s office announced Tuesday.
Senior Correctional Officer Christopher Santana, 32, of Hackensack, was charged with bribery in official and political matters, official misconduct, and contraband. Investigators with the state Office of Public Integrity and Accountability found that he allegedly accepted about $2,000 in bribes to smuggle contraband into the mixed-security lockup in a scheme that started around May 2024, the attorney general’s office said.
The arrest comes as state Department of Corrections officials struggle to contain drug activity behind bars, where several overdoses have resulted in wrongful death lawsuits and accusations of pervasive drug-smuggling. The department converted last year to a mail-scanning system to foil people who spray synthetic marijuana, fentanyl, and other drugs onto paper disguised as mail.
A department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
The investigators who charged Santana saw him arrive for his night shift on June 10 with “a large bulge” in his clothing, the attorney general’s office said. They searched him and discovered two vacuum-sealed bags containing suspected tobacco and three bottles of an unknown liquid under his protective vest and near his thigh, the office said.
Investigators searched incarcerated people suspected of conspiring with Santana in the smuggling scheme and found a cellphone, suspected tobacco, suspected marijuana, and pills suspected to be illegal drugs, the office said. The contraband was seized.
“This type of behavior damages the public’s perception of the many hardworking, honest officers who every day do the difficult, essential work of overseeing correctional institutions across our state,” Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a statement.
Santana, who payroll records show makes $70,630 a year, faces up to 25 years in prison and $315,000 in fines, if convicted.

2.	“Meeting with equity licensees, I heard overwhelmingly from them in large numbers that they're highly concerned about the bill out of the house to raise the license cap,” said Kimberly Roy, a member of the Cannabis Control Commission. “My concern is about consolidation and the Walmart effect, where you're left with a few big box stores and not many local[...]","THE MASSACHUSETTS HOUSE unanimously passed a wide-ranging cannabis bill on June 4 that would allow a single business to own double the number of dispensaries currently allowed by law. But the cannabis industry remains deeply divided on the policy change.
In 2017, the legislature capped the number of retail cannabis stores owned by a single entity at three. The intention was to keep bigger companies – particularly those that operate in multiple states – from buying up large swaths of the state’s cannabis market and make it harder for smaller companies or single owners to compete.
The new cannabis bill would raise the cap to six, allowing cannabis operators to purchase an additional license each year until they hit the cap. It would also allow a single entity to own up 35 percent equity in an unlimited number of cannabis businesses (up from 10 percent) before the ownership stake counts towards the cap. 
Increasing the cap has been pitched as a way to create more opportunities for bigger companies to buy struggling cannabis stores and thereby provide an exit ramp for failing cannabis businesses that want to sell. But there has been opposition to this change from business owners, non-profit leaders, and even a current commissioner on the Cannabis Control Commission who warn that raising the cap presents a dire threat to locally-owned and social-equity operated businesses.
In April, nearly 60 business leaders and advocates in the cannabis industry signed a letter urging legislators to continue to cap the number of dispensaries any business can own at three. They argued that strong ownership limits in the state are key to fostering a competitive and diverse industry that has a place for social equity business owners.
“It’s going to create pretty catastrophic market conditions for independent small businesses who don’t want to give up some of their…ownership control over to multi-state operators,” said Kevin Gilnack, deputy director of the cannabis advocacy group Equitable Opportunities Now. “And it’s going to undermine the Legislature’s goal of empowering communities harmed by the war on drugs.”
The change could help prevent businesses from having to close their doors and allow owners who are going out of business to preserve their finances, said Ryan Dominguez, the head of the Massachusetts Cannabis Coalition, another advocacy group for the cannabis industry.
The increase in the equity ownership ceiling to 35 percent is meant to bring more investment from bigger companies into cannabis businesses struggling to secure capital. 
“We’re just trying to give people and business owners different options on how they want to deal with their businesses,” said Dominguez. 
Current Commissioner Kimberly Roy and former Commissioner Shaleen Title both submitted testimony to the Legislature’s cannabis committee in support of keeping the license cap at three. Raising the cap, they argued, could lead to market consolidation, price manipulation, locally owned and operated social equity businesses being undercut by conglomerates with wholesale purchasing power, and other unintended consequences.
“Meeting with equity licensees, I heard overwhelmingly from them in large numbers that they’re highly concerned about the bill out of the house to raise the license cap,” Roy told CommonWealth Beacon. “My concern is about consolidation and the Walmart effect, where you’re left with a few big box stores and not many locally owned and operated ones.”
Dominguez said that raising the license cap from three to six is a compromise. There were bills under consideration that sought to increase the cap to nine or more. It won’t just be multistate operators who would come into the market to gobble up the cannabis companies, but local businesses would be able to merge to become midsized companies, he added.
Gyasi Sellers, owner of cannabis delivery company Treevit, which operates under a social equity license type, supports raising the license cap and the ownership limits. He said his business is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and that no one has been willing to buy or invest in his business while the cap on ownership remains. Sellers believes that an infusion of money from a larger company could save his company.
“My entire livelihood, my entire business, depends on this change,” said Seller. “Anything’s better than closing the doors and shutting down the operations. Anything’s better than that. That’s the nightmare.” 
The Massachusetts Cannabis Equity Council, a group of 18 cannabis business owners with social equity licenses, has come out against increasing the license cap and argues that this policy change will harm social equity operators and locally-owned cannabis shops the most. 
“From an equity standpoint, I have a lot of concerns regarding lifting the cap because it seems to be antithetical to the underlying motivation of keeping the industry a level playing field for all, especially for social equity applicants,” said Kobie Evans, co-owner of Pure Oasis, the first recreational dispensary in Boston and the first Black-owned store in the state.
Evans said that raising the cap could lead to “a Walmart effect” where one company can have six dispensaries and up to 35 percent stake in an unlimited number of companies, giving them more purchasing power. A company with six retail stores can buy larger quantities, negotiate a lower price for cannabis products and therefore sell them at lower prices than a smaller company with fewer stores. 
“Multi-state operators already dominate shelf space and capital. Expanding their footprint could wipe out the very businesses the state set out to empower,” said Phil Smith, owner of Freshly Baked Co. of Taunton, another social equity licensee. “I understand why some equity operators may want to sell. It’s hard to stay afloat in this market, and bigger players have the capital to get deals done. But if the state allows growth without guardrails, it won’t be a free market, it’ll be a foreclosure.”
In addition to doubling the license cap, the House cannabis bill would increase purchasing and possession limits for cannabis, restructure the Cannabis Control Commission, crack down on hemp-derived intoxicating products, and loosen existing requirements for medical marijuana businesses. The Senate has not indicated any urgency in taking up the cannabis bill. 
Nike John, the owner of The Heritage Club dispensary in Boston and one of the first licensees under the Cannabis Control Commission’s social equity program, has been advocating for the license cap to stay at three. Social equity businesses largely agree on preserving the license cap but aren’t being heard in this debate, she says.
“It seems like they’re doing this without consulting equity operators,” said John. “We’ve reached out, haven’t been able to meet with anybody, and this bill is already here. It’s kind of confusing how this all happened without any consultation of multiple equity operators who have been asking to have a voice.”

(Photo courtesy of Visit Fargo-Moorhead)As super-contagious measles continues to spread and nears a six-year U.S. record, cases in its original epicenter of West Texas may be subsiding as hesitant residents become more concerned and willing to vaccinate, while North Dakota is a new focus with the highest rate of any state.
The reality of measles may be overcoming vaccine misinformation in some areas, despite the purge of experts from decision-making roles in the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The nation’s top vaccine expert resigned under pressure in March.
And on June 11, Kennedy appointed eight new members of an immunization advisory panel — some of whom are vaccine critics — after sacking all 17 members of the group two days earlier. Kennedy called his actions “a major step towards restoring public trust in vaccines.”
The University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, however, called the committee’s mass replacement “one of the darkest days in modern public health history.” The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the move “reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful,” saying Kennedy’s criticism of the original 17 committee members is “completely unfounded.”










Now they’ve seen measles in their community so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’


– Katherine Wells, director of public health in Lubbock, Texas


In West Texas, where outbreaks are concentrated, the city of Lubbock hasn’t seen a new case in 20 days, said Katherine Wells, public health director for the city. The area is east of the largest Texas outbreaks, which were centered on a Mennonite community with religious objections to vaccination.
Wells attributed the recent success to a combination of more vaccinations, public awareness campaigns and willingness to stay home when sick to avoid transmission.
“I talked to some people who, because there’s so much information about the risk of vaccines and the bad side effects, I can see from a parent’s perspective, ‘Why would I give my child that?’” Wells said. “Now they’ve seen measles in their community, so now they’re thinking, ‘OK, now I’m going to get vaccinated.’”
 Outbreak moves north

In North Dakota, however, the state’s 34 cases give it the highest rate in the nation, followed by New Mexico and Texas, according to the North Dakota Public Health Association, a nonprofit health advocacy group that published an analysis of individual states’ data on Facebook. The state’s first case since 2011 was reported May 2.
“This is not a result of local public health failure,” the organization posted. “This is a result of persons in the community choosing not to have their children vaccinated and resisting local public health recommendations and urgent efforts to increase vaccination uptake.”
Dr. Stephen McDonough, a pediatrician and former state health officer in North Dakota, said he hasn’t seen signs of improvement in the state. He doubts recent federal moves will do anything but make the situation worse.
“The outbreak in North Dakota is real, has not peaked yet and is expanding,” McDonough said in an interview. “It was just a matter of time before North Dakota experienced a measles outbreak due to our low immunization rate.”

Middle school band students in Minot, North Dakota, had to cancel trips to a regional band festival and parade in May because of the outbreak. Some 150 unvaccinated children were asked to quarantine for 21 days to avoid further spread.
North Dakota had a 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year, a number that has declined from about 95% in the 2019-2020 school year, according to state records. Vaccination coverage at 95% or above is needed to halt measles transmission.
North Dakota’s small population makes its measles rate misleading, said Jenny Galbraith, an immunization manager for the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services.
However, the state has suffered from low vaccination rates in recent years as more parents have claimed exemptions based on personal philosophy, religion or other reasons as allowed by state law. With about 7% of children exempted, it’s almost impossible to reach the goal of 95% vaccination, she said.
One hopeful sign is that North Dakota hasn’t seen a new measles case since May 28, Galbraith said. “It’s hard to say it’s getting better because we’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.
It’s not always possible to overcome vaccine misinformation in the rural areas where it has taken root, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
Increases in vaccination are generally in “areas where people are already comfortable getting vaccinated,” she said, rather than areas such as parts of North Dakota and Oklahoma “that are more leery of vaccines and harder to penetrate because of misinformation.” Texas County in Oklahoma has 16 confirmed cases, almost all among unvaccinated people.
But local officials can keep stressing the benefits of vaccination and also the need to stay home when measles symptoms appear, advice that those unwilling to vaccinate may be more likely to heed, Freeman said.
“In this day and age, it’s an embarrassment that we’ve lost three people to measles,” she said, referring to the three deaths reported this year.
‘Cautiously optimistic’ in Texas
According to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention update June 13, there are 1,197 confirmed cases affecting 34 states. Navajo County, Arizona, reported the state’s first four cases this week.
There have been 21 measles outbreaks, defined as clusters of three or more related cases, this year compared with 16 in all of last year, according to the CDC. Cases are now more than four times higher than they were all of last year. And with less than half the year over, case numbers are closing in on 2019’s high of 1,274.
That’s still a small number compared with almost 28,000 cases in 1990, when an outbreak centered in California hit low-income areas with low vaccination rates.
While the total case count grows, the number of weekly new infections is dropping since a peak of 116 in late March.
In Texas, outbreaks have slowed as unvaccinated people have either gotten vaccinated or become infected and gained immunity, said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services.
“The number of new cases in West Texas has slowed down and we are cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue,” Anton said.
The current list of states affected by confirmed measles cases this year: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Isiah Holmes | Wisconsin Examiner)Every day, I work on the frontlines of the addiction and overdose crisis here in Charleston, a crisis that has hit West Virginia harder than any other state in the nation. This work is difficult. 
As a clinical psychologist, I sit with people as they recall name after name of friends and loved ones lost to overdose. I listen as people recount their own near-misses and overflowing of gratitude for life saving overdose reversal medications.
But all of this work is at risk because of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that was adopted by the House of Representatives last month and is now before the U.S. Senate. This legislation slashes Medicaid by around $800 billion and will harm millions of people across the country, including 507,000 West Virginians who are only able to access critical health care because of this life-saving program.
Medicaid is the largest provider of addiction treatment in the country, providing coverage for 56% of people who utilize medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) and 64% of people who receive outpatient treatment for their OUD. Over 34,000 West Virginians rely on Medicaid for addiction services that would otherwise be unavailable. The majority of my patients with OUD use Medicaid to access lifesaving treatment and care. I have seen, over and over, how Medicaid saves and changes lives.
Cabin Creek Health Systems is a Federally Qualified Health Center that operates six integrated primary care clinics and eight school-based clinics across Kanawha County. Our goal has been, and always will be, to provide care to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay. Medicaid is a critical piece to achieving this goal that allows us to meet our patients where they are, financially, and still keep the lights on. If passed, Medicaid cuts would make it extremely difficult for many of my patients and others across Cabin Creek Health Systems to receive the care they depend on — from primary care to behavioral health, to our black lung clinic and addiction treatment programs.
One of the most harmful provisions in the bill — the work reporting requirement — forces many people on Medicaid to update the government every month on how many hours they have worked. If they fail to comply, they will lose their health care coverage.
As many as 110,000 hardworking and otherwise eligible West Virginians could lose their health care, simply because they sent the wrong form, couldn’t pick up enough shifts at work, or needed to take care of a loved one. The members of Congress who support this provision mistakenly believe it encourages people to work. The reality is that most people on Medicaid already work. These work reporting requirements would create a web of red tape that will push thousands of people off Medicaid.
We saw this very situation following the unwinding of expanded Medicaid access that occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of West Virginians — many of whom met all eligibility requirements — were suddenly left in a panic when they walked in for medical appointments only to find out they had lost their health insurance overnight, often due to something as simple as forgetting to notify Medicaid of a change of address or phone number.
While we were able to continue care for our patients and assist many in the long and arduous process of re-applying, many other health systems were not equipped for this, and many patients went without lifesaving medical care.
Patients don’t need more hurdles and barriers to care, especially the many who are already in poor health, disabled, dealing with substance use disorders, or living in challenging circumstances. They have enough to juggle without the risk of losing their health care hanging over their heads every single month.
If patients lose Medicaid, many will be forced to wait until they’re in a crisis and will go to the emergency room, instead of receiving less expensive preventative care at a clinic. This unnecessarily expends precious resources and burdens the health care system.
Health care systems will also be facing extreme challenges from the financial strain imposed by the legislation. Many of West Virginia’s rural hospitals may be forced to close as a result of this bill. This puts the lives and well-being of West Virginians at risk. Our community members should not be forced to drive for hours to receive care.
If the goal is to improve the health and well-being of West Virginians, to reduce overdose deaths, to incentivize work, and to improve management and occurrence of chronic health conditions, this legislation is not the solution. The good news is that our senators, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and Sen. Jim Justice, have witnessed firsthand the challenges we face and the impact this legislation will have on West Virginians. We urge them to continue to safeguard the health of West Virginians and to spare us from this looming catastrophe by opposing this legislation.

(Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star) State lawmakers are debating juvenile justice reform proposals aimed at improving Pennsylvania’s approach to supporting youth offenders and holding providers and public officials accountable. 
The House Children and Youth Committee passed four measures Tuesday, as other legislators promoted additional bills they’re developing on the issue. 
Rep. Melissa Shusterman (D-Paoli) put forth a three-part package. 
“The allegations of abuse in Pennsylvania juvenile detention facilities require all of us to act,” Shusterman said. “Young people report that these facilities are unsafe, unclean and unable or unwell. We have to be willing to provide the effective treatment and education that these young people require.”
One bill would create a juvenile detention database.
Another would guarantee legal representation for children in custody  – and a 50 percent state reimbursement to counties for the cost. 
The third lays out rules for using physical restraints on minors in custody as a “last resort.” It would prohibit their use as a punishment or for convenience’s sake, and establish documenting, auditing and reporting requirements intended to enhance transparency and accountability. 
Rep. Carol Kazeem (D-Delaware) is pushing for a Joint State Government Commission study of youth justice facilities across the state and establishing guidance for running them, including utilizing video surveillance and optimizing staff training, recruitment and retention. The study also would explore expanding at-home detention including through using electronic monitoring devices. 
A grand jury requested a study on best operational practices in its report on rampant abuse at the Delaware County Juvenile Detention Center that closed in 2021, according to Kazeem’s resolution. 
Rep. Kate Klunk (R-Hanover), minority chair of the committee, said the GOP wants more information on costs and to avoid confusion with similar analyses already underway on restraints, specifically, as well as general best practices for youth detention.
“I do think that it might be premature in moving forward with this while that is working through the regulatory review process… those particular concerns regarding restraints and some of the regulation changes that the department is looking at right now,” Klunk said.
The committee passed Kazeem’s resolution and Schusterman’s bill to establish a juvenile incarceration facilities database on party line votes. 
Rep. Bob Day (R-Macungie)’s designee put forth a vote supporting Shusterman’s other two measures – one laying out rules for physically restraining kids in custody and another guaranteeing counsel for them in addition to partial reimbursement for the cost to counties. 
Day did not respond to a request for comment. 
Meanwhile, additional justice reform proposals have been dropping since being introduced as the CARE package earlier this year. 
Representatives Andre Carroll and Anthony Bellmon spoke Tuesday about drawing up a bill that would create a statewide youth ombudsman, along the lines of the local role established in Philadelphia, which they both represent.

Wes Moore at a May news conference in the State House. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown has filed or signed onto two dozen lawsuits by states challenging Trump administration actions.
But not this one.
When California filed suit last week to defend its ability to set tougher vehicle emission standards — standards aimed at speeding adoption of electric vehicles — 10 states that had adopted the standards quickly joined the suit. Even though Maryland has adopted the California rules, it did not join.
A spokesperson for Brown said the attorney general’s office is “monitoring the California lawsuit while we assess the best path for the State to remain vigilant in enforcing standards that will help us achieve these climate goals.”
“Here in Maryland, we have made it a priority to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, setting ambitious goals to preserve our clean air and water,” wrote Kelsey Hartman, the spokesperson.
But environmental groups, still smarting from Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) decision in April to delay penalties under the California rules, were not pleased by Brown’s hesitation.
“If it is a ‘priority’ for Maryland to reduce greenhouse gases, then we should be first in line to sue over the Trump effort to remove our legal right to require cleaner cars,” said Mike Tidwell, executive director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, in a statement. “Instead we are completely missing in action on one of the most important climate lawsuits of the Trump era.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Tidwell called it “inconceivable that Attorney General Brown is not joining California and ten other Clean Car states in fighting President Trump in court.”
The Maryland chapter of the Sierra Club urged the state to join California’s suit “and use every other tool at its disposal to defend our clean vehicle programs.” Lindsey Mendelson, the club’s senior transportation campaign representative, said in a statement that it’s important for Maryland to help keep the California regulations “on the books,” saying the congressional votes upending the program were “clearly unlawful.”
President Donald Trump has issued executive orders to roll back clean energy programs, including a freeze on billions of dollars for states to build electric vehicle charging stations along key highways under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. Maryland joined 15 other states to challenge that move in court.
The action reining in the California regulations was an act of Congress, not an executive order.
Ramón Palencia-Calvo, senior director for Chispa Maryland, a program of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said Tuesday the league is “still trying to seek clarification” on why Brown had not joined California’s suit. While it’s still possible Maryland could join the suit, Palencia-Calvo said, the EV rules are “key programs” for reducing climate pollution, particularly in vulnerable communities that tend to surround busy state highways.
“Here at Maryland LCV, we continue to support implementation of these two programs,” he said.
It’s not the first disappointment this year for Maryland advocates over the California rules.
In April, Moore issued an executive order that allows the state to delay financial penalties for car manufacturers that do not meet sales targets that were set to kick in next year with the introduction of model year 2027 electric vehicles.
Originally, 43% of new cars sold in Maryland in model year 2027 were supposed to be zero-emission. Under Moore’s order, penalties would not be applied for the 2027 and 2028 model years, unless California officials reach a new agreement on the rule’s requirements with car manufacturers representing at least 40% of the market share.

The order did not change the ultimate goal of the program, which is to require that 100% of passenger cars sold in the state by model year 2035 be electric.
Administration officials noted that, as of 2024, EV sales represented about 12% of new car purchases in Maryland, according to the Maryland Department of Transportation. Moore’s order relaxing the penalties was needed to give “manufacturers, dealers, and Marylanders a fair shot to prepare” for the higher sale targets, they said.
Maryland auto dealers had expressed concern that car manufacturers would send fewer vehicles to the state in order to ensure that the percentage of EVs would be high enough to meet the state’s target. State officials had previously argued that manufacturers could trade credits with one another to significantly reduce their obligations.
In May, with California’s Advanced Clean Cars program under fire, Moore joined 10 other governors in an “Affordable Clean Cars Coalition” to “sustain America’s transition to cleaner and more affordable cars, support U.S. automotive manufacturers and workers, and preserve states’ clean air authority,” according to a Department of the Environment news release.
Moore’s April executive order also created a working group to study how the Advanced Clean Cars rule can be “successfully implemented” in Maryland.
Peter Kitzmiller, president of the Maryland Auto Dealer’s Association, said he is excited for that group to convene, because his members are eager to sell EVs, having already invested in the vehicles and their charging technology.
“We have to sell these vehicles and we need to sell them in bigger numbers than we’re doing,” Kitzmiller said. “We’ve got to get a return on our investment.”
Kitzmiller said he is also concerned about other federal action on EVs, including the possible end to a $7,500 tax credit for buyers. That loss could drive EV purchases down in the short term, he said, but he is hoping that any decline would be temporary.
“That’s going to be the thing to look at: What’s the impact going to be on the market?” Kitzmiller said.
As Trump hits 100 days, Brown among attorneys general battling him at every turn

The California rules were aimed at helping create a market for EVs. In order to set emissions standards stricter than the federal government’s, California receives a waiver from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Under that authority, California has set the EV sales rules.
But the Republican-led Congress adopted resolutions disproving of the waivers under the Congressional Review Act. Trump signed the measures June 12, saying in a statement that the resolutions were “ending the electric vehicle mandate for good.”
“It is the Federal Government, not States, that should establish vehicle emissions standards given the inherently interstate nature of air quality; a patchwork of State vehicle regulations on this subject is unworkable,” Trump wrote. “Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation.”
In its lawsuit, California argued that the Congressional Review Act could not be used to overturn its waivers, because the waiver decisions are not considered formal federal rules.
“The CRA has never before been used in any context that resembles this one. It has certainly never been used, as it was here, to negate particular state laws,” reads the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
The suit says the review act was simply an end run around the lengthy process of rolling back the waivers through an administrative process at EPA, which Trump did during his first administration. Congressional leaders and administration officials “took these unprecedented steps because they saw the CRA as a quick and easy way to ‘take … down’ California’s regulations,” the lawsuit said.
Kitzmiller said he was “a little surprised” not to see Maryland on the list of litigants beside California.
But he said he “wouldn’t read too much into it.” It was always expected that California would lead the litigation countering the Trump administration’s efforts to end the program, Kitzmiller said.

Jackson meets reporters Tuesday, one day after Prince George’s County Circuit Court judges selected her as interim state’s attorney. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A day before she’s to be sworn in as interim Prince George’s County state’s attorney, Tara H. Jackson summarized her philosophy Tuesday.
“My philosophy is simple. I will always try to do the right thing, to seek truth, to uphold the law and to pursue justice,” Jackson said during a briefing Tuesday at the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building in Largo.
Jackson was picked by the county’s circuit court judges from four applicants seeking to replace Aisha Breveboy, who leaves the state’s attorney job to be sworn in Wednesday as the new county executive.
It’s the second straight interim role for Jackson, who was serving as  the county’s chief administrative officer when then-County Executive Angela Alsobrooks (D) was elected last fall to the U.S. Senate. Under the county charter, the chief administrative officer steps in when there’s vacancy in the county executive’s office, and Jackson has been serving in that role for about six months now.
Jackson immediately said she was not interested in running for the permanent county executive job. But state’s attorney, which she calls a return “to my roots,” is different.
When asked Tuesday if she might run for state’s attorney in the 2026 election, Jackson said, “Let me get into the job, first. I won’t rule it out.”
Jackson noted that she began her legal career as an assistant state’s attorney in the office, where Alsobrooks also worked as the first full-time assistant state’s attorney to handle domestic violence cases.

After eight years in private practice, Jackson returned to the county as principal deputy state’s attorney and then deputy county attorney.
“I understand the job of state’s attorney and the importance of the office to individuals in our community,” she said Tuesday.
County Councilmember Wanika Fisher had indicated an interest in pursuing the interim state’s attorney appointment, but released a statement Monday morning saying she would not seek the temporary job. Fisher cited the cost of a special election to fill her District 2 council seat if she moved into the state’s attorney job now. She estimated such a race could cost $500,000 to $800,000.
But Fisher did say she plans to run for state’s attorney in 2026 — when she could face Jackson.
Jackson takes over as the county police department faces the possible loss of Chief Malik Aziz, whois a finalist for the same position in Phoenix.
“In whatever he chooses to pursue, I wish him well,” Jackson said.
If Aziz leaves, Jackson said she would hope to see a replacement “who has the same philosophy as I do. We want to pursue justice. We just don’t want to lock up folks. We’re not just trying to put people in jail. We want due process to be the rule of the day.”
An email Tuesday from the Maryland Judiciary said Jackson will be sworn in during a “closed event” Wednesday.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The University of Maryland Medical System is suing a Maryland Medicaid insurer that it claims “unlawfully” denied $15 million in claims for medical care delivered in UMMS emergency rooms over the last three years.
The complaint alleges that Maryland Physicians Care MCO broke legal and contractual obligations by denying payment not as “a reasonable disagreement over medical judgment” but in a “broad, bad-faith refusal to acknowledge the realities of patient care, driven by a pursuit of enhanced profitability.”
The suit, filed Monday in Baltimore City Circuit Court, asks the court to declare that Maryland Physicians Care wrongfully denied claims for certain emergency care and to make it pay the $15 million the medical system believes it is owed. UMMS also wants the court to prohibit the managed care organization’s use of its current automatic claims approval system.
Maryland Physicians Care CEO Jason Rottman said the company believes it has acted lawfully, and it “strongly disputes the University of Maryland Medical System’s unfounded characterizations.”
“We have worked in good faith to address these concerns with the University of Maryland Medical System and have engaged in dialogue to seek resolution,” Rottman said in a statement Monday.
Maryland Physicians Care is one of nine Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) in Maryland. Medicaid MCOs receive federal and state tax dollars to cover medical care for those who qualify for Medicaid, including in emergency rooms.

Health systems such as UMMS are supposed to be reimbursed for medical services provided in emergency situations under certain circumstances. But the lawsuit claims that Maryland Physicians Care has unlawfully denied claims that should have been covered.
Federal law uses the “prudent layperson” rule to determine whether or not a claim in an emergency setting is covered. That means that if a person with an average knowledge of health and medicine went to an emergency room because they reasonably believed their symptoms required immediate medical attention, insurers should pay hospitals for that care, regardless of the outcome.
But UMMS alleges that Maryland Physicians Care instead relies on its internal system, called the “Sudden and Serious” list, that automatically approves or denies claims based on diagnosis. The list’s definition of what qualifies as an emergency is more narrow than the prudent layperson standard, the suit says.
It says MPC also regularly denies claims based on the entire medical record of the emergency visit, not the layperson’s initial assessment, which “intentionally ignores” the prudent layperson standard.
As a result,Maryland Physicians Care has improperly denied payment for medical care UMMS provided to more the 15,000 patients, resulting in $15 million in unpaid services, including interest, over the last three years, the lawsuit says.
The suit cites the case where a man was in recovery from a motor vehicle accident who experienced significant abdominal pain. The physician ordered a CT scan for the man’s chest and spine, but Maryland Physicians Care denied payment for the scans, saying the symptoms were not “acute” symptoms of sufficient severity to justify CT scans. UMMS appealed that decision, and a third-party review organization sided with the hospital system.

UMMS also claims that Maryland Physicians Care withheld payment for sustained hospital care, citing the case of a patient with multiple conditions – including a recent stroke, HIV, COVID-19 and sepsis – who was hospitalized for three months. Maryland Physicians Care denied coverage for portions of the hospital stay, “asserting—without any credible clinical basis—that the patient could have been safely discharged,” according to the complaint.
UMMS said denials extended to even “the most fragile newborns,” pointing to an infant born three months prematurely, who weighed about a pound and had been exposed to fentanyl and cocaine in utero. The infant had significant medical need due to “extreme respiratory distress, recurrent apnea, severe feeding intolerance, and numerous other comorbidities associated with extreme prematurity,” the suit said.
“It is hard to conceive of a patient more in need of, and deserving of, intense clinical intervention. And yet, MPC denied significant portions of her treatment—questioning the need for care even during the height of her clinical instability,” the complaint says.
But Rottman said Maryland Physicians Care adheres to state and federal laws for claims.
“Maryland Physicians Care … is committed to the highest standards of integrity and compliance in administering health benefits since 1997 on behalf of our partner, the Maryland Department of Health,” Rottman’s statement said.
“We strictly adhere to all state and federal rules and guidelines as our policies and procedures are regularly reviewed by the MD Department of Health as well as national accrediting bodies,” his statement said. “The rigorous reviews consistently confirm that we meet regulatory requirements.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_jun317_umms_adminbuilding-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-18 05:58:31.182010

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Medicaid expansion helped Kentucky and other states get more people covered by health insurance, but proposed federal cuts could undo that, a new report found. 
“Fragile Progress, Continuing Disparities,” released Wednesday by the Commonwealth Fund, also shows a decline in the number of children getting routine vaccinations against such diseases as measles, mumps and rubella.
Kentucky was among the worst states for vaccinations, with 64% of children having all doses of recommended vaccines. Of its neighbors, Kentucky’s childhood vaccination rates were higher than only Tennessee, where about 63% of children are fully vaccinated. Commonwealth Fund researchers said misinformation about vaccines has caused public trust to decrease. 
Researchers also found that from 2013-2023, rates of uninsured individuals across the country fell to a “historic low,” Dr. Joseph Betancourt, the Commonwealth Fund president, said during a Tuesday call. 
“The coverage gains can largely be attributed to provisions in the Affordable Care Act that made Medicaid available to more people and that helped many low and middle income people afford the cost of health coverage purchased from federal and state run health insurance marketplaces,” Betancourt said. 
The report highlights how Kentucky’s decision to expand Medicaid to more low-income people has increased access to health care.
“In Kentucky, one of the first states to expand Medicaid eligibility, the uninsured rate for people with incomes under 200 percent of poverty ($30,120 for an individual and $62,400 for a family of four) fell by two-thirds between 2013 and 2023, from 38 percent to 12 percent,” the report states. “By contrast, in Tennessee, which has not expanded Medicaid, the uninsured rate for the same group of low-income adults declined by only one-third, from 37 percent to 24 percent.” 
Kentucky is inching higher in the report’s health rankings — from 40th among the 50 states in the 2023 report to 37th overall in the 2025 report. The state improved on several measures, including having more people covered by health insurance, fewer people with medical debt in collections and fewer depressed youth not getting treatment.
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are pushing to cut Medicaid over the next decade. A proposal that emerged from a U.S. Senate committee Monday makes even deeper cuts than those already approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in a controversial spending and tax package, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump who supports the measure. The federal-state Medicaid program pays for almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care. Many health advocates are warning the Republican legislation will hurt hospitals and patients. 
Is health care affordable, accessible?
The Commonwealth Fund report looks at a variety of measures to rank how well health systems work across the nation. Researchers look at how affordable and accessible health care is, how widespread prevention treatments like vaccinations and screenings are, the prevalence of preventable deaths and more.

The report shows:

In 2023, 4% of Kentucky children ages 0-18 were uninsured. The national average is 5%. 
In 2023, 8% of Kentucky adults ages 19-64 were uninsured, which is lower than the national average of 11%. 
In 2022, 40% of Kentucky adults hadn’t had a dental visit in the past year. That’s higher than the national average of 36%. 
In 2023, 36% of children did not have all their recommended vaccinations. The national average is 31%. 
In 2022, 70% of Kentucky adults living with substance use disorder did not receive treatment.  Nationally, that number is 77%. 
From 2020-2023, the 30-day hospital mortality in Kentucky was 15%, slightly higher than 14% across the U.S. 
In 2022-2023, Kentucky had 117 preventable deaths per 100,000 people, higher than the national rate of 86. 
In 2022, for every 1,000 live births in Kentucky, there were nearly 5.8 baby deaths, slightly higher than the 5.6 national average. 
In 2023, there were nearly 18 suicides for every 100,000 people. The national average is 14. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988. 
In 2023, Kentucky saw 18 firearm deaths per 100,000 people, which is higher than the national rate of 14. 
In 2022, 16% of Kentucky adults had lost six or more teeth. The national average is 9%. 
In 2023, Kentucky had more diabetic adults get their annual hemoglobin A1c test. That year, 4% of diabetic adults in Kentucky didn’t have the test, which is much better than the national average of 9%.

Betancount said the insights should be a “call to action for policy makers” both federally and at the state level to “make sure everyone in America can get the care they need, no matter who they are, where they live, or how much money they earn.” 
“I see patients every week, and I and people across the nation can tell you that there is no substitute for being able to get the care you need when you need it, and the evidence is clear that policies that make health insurance and health care more affordable and accessible work and make a difference for people everywhere every day.”
Even though Kentucky still has a lot of bad health marks, having higher rates of insured people is key to improving health, said Sara R. Collins, a senior scholar and vice president for health care coverage and access and tracking health system performance at The Commonwealth Fund.
“Health insurance coverage is essential in this country,” she said. “One cannot access health care without it, except if you’re very, very wealthy.” 
It’s also important to have high quality of coverage, low deductibles, low cost sharing, Collins said. 
“We continue to have a lot of people, millions of people, who are underinsured in the country, and there are ways of addressing that, through public policy and changes in insurer behavior,” she said. “But it is really a necessary condition for improving home health system performance.”

One of the most disturbing developments of the second Trump administration has been the President’s clear effort to encourage U.S. military service members to endorse his political views and exhibit loyalty to him personally.
This pattern was on display last week at Fort Bragg where Trump inappropriately sought to engage the troops in booing former President Biden and other elected leaders.
This represents a deeply troubling break with 250 years of well-established law and tradition in which servicemembers swear loyalty to the Constitution – not any individual.
Fortunately, many veterans of all parties and persuasions are forcefully pushing back. Many were in attendance across the nation at last Saturday’s “No Kings” events where they loudly, proudly and repeatedly rejected Trump’s offensive impersonation of a would-be autocrat.
The bottom line: the United States is a nation of laws that no individual is above. And try as he might, our veterans have made clear this is not a principle that Donald Trump should or will succeed in destroying.

(Photo by Michael G. Seamans/ Maine Morning Star)After the chambers of the Maine Legislature failed to agree, an effort to remove the state from a compact that seeks to abolish the Electoral College failed on Tuesday. 
In 2024, the Legislature adopted something called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which Gov. Janet Mills allowed to become law without her signature. 
States that are part of the compact pledge their Electoral College votes to the presidential candidate with the most overall votes across the country, but it would only take effect once states with a total of 270 Electoral College votes have joined. Including Maine, 17 states and the District of Columbia have ratified the agreement, giving the compact a total of 209 electoral votes. 
Earlier this month, the Maine House of Representatives passed legislation, LD 252, that sought to repeal the decision to enter the compact. 
The Senate tabled the bill until Monday, when the upper chamber failed to pass it with a 16-18 vote before ultimately rejecting it. 
Both the House and Senate insisted on their positions on Tuesday, effectively killing the bill. 
Maine and Nebraska are the only states that split their electoral votes across candidates. Other states use a winner-take-all system where the candidate with the majority of the state’s popular vote gets all of the state’s electoral votes.
During floor speeches throughout consideration of LD 252, lawmakers disagreed on whether the current system or one in which the Electoral College is nullified would better represent Maine. 
In the House on Tuesday, Rep. Barbara A. Bagshaw (R-Windham) argued the current system reflects the will of all 50 states individually, whereas the National Popular Vote would dilute Mainers’ votes. 
However, Rep. Arthur Bell (D-Yarmouth), who sponsored the legislation to enter the pact last year, argued during a floor debate last month that the Electoral College system results in candidates only paying attention to voters in swing states, which Maine is not.
Mills allowed the measure to become law last year because she saw merit in both sides of this argument. “Recognizing that this measure has been the subject of public discussion several times before in Maine, I would like this important nationwide debate to continue and so I will allow this bill to become law without my signature,” she said in the statement at the time. 
And both sides of the debate do not fall squarely along party lines.
While LD 252 was sponsored solely by Republicans, it has been backed by some Democrats in committee and floor votes. 
In April, the majority of the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee voted in favor of it, with eight legislators — Republicans, Democrats and one unenrolled — in support and five Democrats opposed.
Separately, the committee voted against another proposal, LD 1356, that sought to change Maine’s method of allocating electoral votes from the current district split to a winner-take-all system — but only if Nebraska also adopts winner-take-all. This bill is currently tabled in the House. 
In April, the Nebraska Legislature killed a bill that sought to make this switch, after Republicans failed to secure enough votes to overcome a four-hour filibuster.

John Hoffman and his wife.
The police have identified 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter as the suspected gunman. Boelter  had a list in his car of dozens of people including elected officials and abortion providers, according to police. Boelter was apprehended Monday and faces federal and state murder charges.
All three of Wisconsin’s federal Democratic lawmakers and 11 state lawmakers were identified as being named in documents left behind by Boelter.
According to Politico, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin spokesperson Eli Rosen said Monday she was notified by law enforcement she was included on the alleged shooter’s list of names and “is grateful for law enforcement’s swift action to keep the community safe.” 
Rosen also said Baldwin “remains focused on the things that matter most here: honoring the legacy and life of Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, praying for the other victims who are fighting for their lives, and condemning this abhorrent, senseless political violence.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore wrote on social media that she was aware her name was on one of the documents recovered from the vehicle of the suspect in Minnesota. 
“I thank law enforcement for their swift notification and subsequent response,” Moore said. “My prayers are with all those impacted by these horrific acts.” 
U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan has said he is “appreciative that law enforcement apprehended the suspect” in the shooting and he had heard that his name was in the Minnesota shooting suspect’s notebooks.
“I will not back down in the face of terror, however, we as elected officials must do better to lower the temperature,” Pocan said. “That said, my schedule remains unchanged.”
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 11 Wisconsin state lawmakers were named in lists left behind by Boelter. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) has requested additional security for the Assembly floor session this week, according to Vos’ communications director Luke Wolff. Vos’ office  declined to provide additional details about the new security plan Tuesday afternoon.
The Wisconsin State Senate Sergeant at Arms Timothy La Sage announced Monday a series of enhanced security protocols at the State Capitol being taken in coordination with Capitol police, including “increased situational awareness practices, strengthened access control points, and updated emergency response protocols.” Specific security details are not being disclosed publicly, according to the statement.
The steps are meant to provide a secure and responsive environment and maintain public accessibility and civic engagement.
“The safety of those who serve, work, and visit the Capitol is my top priority,” La Sage said. “We remain vigilant and prepared. These enhancements are part of our ongoing commitment to security and public service.”
The week prior to the Minnesota attacks, Wisconsin Democrats on the budget committee spoke about increasing political violence across the country and, specifically, the targeting of judges and justices as they defended a budget request to add specific security for the state Supreme Court. State lawmakers have passed bipartisan laws in the past to help protect judges. Republicans on the committee, however, rejected this proposal, saying that the Capitol police is doing a good job and there isn’t a need for separate security.
At a press conference following the budget committee’s Tuesday meeting, Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said she thinks increasing security at the Capitol is part of a “broader conversation that state legislatures are having all around the country.”
“I’m hopeful that we’re going to have some of that in Wisconsin,” Roys said. “Obviously, our thoughts are with all of our colleagues in Minnesota.”
Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) told WISN-12 reporter Matt Smith that he wants increased security around the Capitol, including metal detectors and a ban on members of the public (but not lawmakers) carrying guns into the building.
“I have not been through another Capitol that has not had metal detectors,” Kapenga said. “We need to have a higher level of security just because of, unfortunately, ingenuity with how you can hurt people.”
Security at the state Capitol was a point of concern previously in 2023 after a man entered the building twice with a gun in search of Gov. Tony Evers. At the time, Evers said about increasing security that he was “sure they are looking at that” but that it was “not something we talk about [or] something police talk about.”

When diamondback terrapins spy bait sitting in a crab pot, they often push their way inside to feast, only to get stuck.
Terrapins, a small and vulnerable species, use lungs to breathe and can drown while trapped in cages underwater.
Conservation groups are asking Virginia regulators to require a solution: adding small gadgets to crab traps that keep terrapins out while still allowing crabs to enter.
“Virginia can take a really important step to saving this species by adopting this really simple, cheap, easy rule,” said Will Harlan, Southeast director and senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity.
The organization, along with the Virginia Herpetological Society and nonprofit Wild Virginia, petitioned the Virginia Marine Resources Commission earlier this year to require what are called turtle excluder devices on any crab pots used less than 150 yards from shore.
The commission will consider the petition on June 24.
Diamondback terrapins are the only turtle in the U.S. to live in brackish water, which is a mix of freshwater and saltwater that makes up most of the Chesapeake Bay.

The terrapin is considered a keystone species because of its role as a predator that helps maintain the salt marsh ecosystem and ingestion of eelgrass seeds, which helps distribute the seeds throughout the environment, according to the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources.
The turtles were heavily harvested in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and now face pressure from development and other human activities on their habitat and nesting areas, Virginia officials say.
Harlan said the population of terrapins along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts has plummeted by about 75% in the last 50 years. The federal government is in the process of studying whether to list the species as endangered.
“They’re in trouble,” Harlan said. “And the biggest threat to terrapins are crab traps.”
Roughly 60,000 to 80,000 terrapins drown in crab pots each year, he said.
Turtle excluder devices, or TEDs — also known as bycatch reduction devices — have been around for decades.
Biology professor Randy Chambers has studied the issue since he started working at William & Mary in 2001.
The devices work just as they sound, he said, narrowing the openings that allow marine life into crab traps.
“The shells of a turtle are much higher in profile than the shell of a crab, so crabs can still slip into the traps,” Chambers said. “But turtles are excluded.”
He and other researchers at William & Mary’s Keck Lab have spent years studying the effectiveness of various designs of TEDs, combining different shapes, colors and materials.
“The overall impact of all these different bycatch reduction devices has been a dramatic reduction in the bycatch of terrapins” – a decrease of about 90%, Chambers said.
The Keck Lab uses 3D printers to produce a red, oval-shaped device designed by a research associate. Crabbers can also simply narrow the funnels of their cages using standard wire when constructing traps, he said.

Maryland officials recognized back in the 1940s that the design of crab traps also attracts animals such as turtles, diving birds and muskrats, Chambers said. The state banned the use of commercial-style traps in tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. In 2000, Maryland started requiring the use of TEDs.
The VMRC currently “strongly encourages” TEDS for all recreational crab pots, and offers discounted fees for those who do so.
Harlan said the lack of regulation puts Virginia behind other East Coast states.
“Virginia’s kind of the last holdout, and is probably the most important habitat for diamondback terrapins,” he said.
Many commercial crabbers in Virginia oppose the proposed regulation.
“Without concrete research, implementing TEDs in crab pots could be an unnecessary burden on the crabbing industry rather than a proven conservation measure,” watermen wrote in a public comment to VMRC.
“More studies would be required to determine if there is any legitimate risk to turtle populations before requiring additional modifications to crab pots in Virginia waters.”
Chambers said research shows a slight reduction in crab catch when TEDs are used – a significant effect in an industry already facing challenges with a declining crab population.
The devices cost only about $1 or $2, but having to buy hundreds of them would be another economic constraint.
However, environmental groups’ petition to VMRC requests regulation only for waters within 150 yards of shore, where most crabbing is recreational.
Harlan said they’re open to any measures the commission would be willing to enact, such as limiting the rule to recreational crabbing.
“This species is really important socially and culturally for the entire region and especially Virginians. This is their turtle,” he said. “Keeping terrapins around means keeping our marshes healthier.”

(Getty image)With the end of the legislative session fast approaching, a slate of bills is on track for passage in the Rhode Island General Assembly that will increase the cost of insurance for the state’s drivers.
Insurers cannot endlessly absorb costs and still offer protections for drivers. The money to pay for increased burdens being considered by state lawmakers will have to come from somewhere. Insurers do not have unlimited reserves, so the rates paid by Rhode Island residents would likely go up if these bills pass.
This is part of a years-long pattern in Rhode Island. Onerous regulation and legislation have played a significant role in making Rhode Island the fifth-most expensive state in the country for auto insurance.
Rhode Island drivers now pay the highest amount for collision repair in the country, thanks in large part to bills coming out of Smith Hill over the past five years. The average collision repair cost for a driver in the Ocean State was $1,987 in 2024, according to Auto Body News. In Hawaii, the least expensive state, the average cost was $410 for collision repairs.
One out of every six Rhode Island drivers is now going without any auto insurance. We rank 16th in the country in that respect. This is another pressure point for auto insurance, raising costs for those who continue to protect themselves and others by paying for insurance.
The problem could now get worse. Five different bills all have a significant likelihood of passage and would likely continue to increase costs for Rhode Island residents.

H.5104/S.766 would prohibit the use of ZIP code alone in territorial rate-making. This would make it harder to accurately price risk. It would also likely cause drivers in areas with fewer accidents to pay more in premiums to make up for the cost of drivers in areas with more accidents.
H.6053/S.902 would increase the total loss threshold from its current 75% to 85%. This is the standard for when a damaged vehicle is considered to be totaled and in need of replacement rather than repair. This would be among the highest rates in the country. It would likely increase the number of potentially dangerous vehicles on the road that have been badly damaged but repaired rather than sent to the scrap heap. Our estimate is that this change would lead to an increase of 2,128 vehicles each year that are sent for repairs rather than declared a total loss, and that this would increase insurance costs by at least $3 million.
H.6079/S.985 would require insurers to cover additional drivers to use rental vehicles. This requirement to increase coverage of risk would necessarily drive up the cost of insurance for these rental vehicles.
H.6032/S.925 would pile another mandate on to insurers who cover rental vehicles, forcing them to pay luxury rental upcharges. It would prohibit insurers from negotiating with car rental companies over the type of vehicle that is rented to a driver whose automobile is being repaired. This would add an estimated $5 million in insurance costs, which would again drive up costs for everyday Rhode Island residents.
H.6054/S.901 would bar insurers from using an out of court appraisal appeal process for resolving auto insurance disputes. This would likely inflate repair appraisals and increase litigation, leading again to higher premiums for Rhode Island drivers.

Rhode Island didn’t become this expensive overnight, and recovery won’t happen overnight. But the first step to charting the right course is to stop heading the wrong direction, rather than continuing down the path of higher costs for Rhode Island drivers.

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia could be on the hook for $8 million to cover two initiatives to address student attendance and teacher retention if the federal government denies the commonwealth’s appeals, House lawmakers learned on Monday.
Appeals for federal relief funds for Virginia schools remain uncertain

The Virginia Department of Education, along with 14 school divisions and the Department of Juvenile Justice, filed appeals after being informed that the deadline for spending all allocated funds was abruptly moved to March 28 of this year. The original deadline had been set for March 2026.
VDOE’s two appeals focused on the state’s Attendance Data Dashboard, designed to combat chronic absenteeism, and Grow Your Own, a program to support teacher apprenticeship pipelines. If the agency’s appeal is unsuccessful, education leaders will likely return to lawmakers with a request to make up the difference for the two programs in state dollars.
“We believe that the attendance dashboard is really critical,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson at Monday’s House Appropriations Committee meeting. 
She said the data is “incredibly informative” for school divisions and for the state to determine where to send resources and support when mitigation is needed. However, the development has been suspended because the federal agency cut off the relief funds.
Gullickson said the agency is considering other ways to support the development of the system and the teacher apprenticeship program.
The state agency is also appealing for $25 million for 14 school divisions, including Halifax County, the cities of Richmond and Portsmouth, and the Department of Juvenile Justice. The funds could be utilized to address the learning loss from the pandemic and improve school facilities.
Gullickson said some projects are already completed or are near completion. 
Lawmakers expressed serious concern about the potential loss of funding for school divisions.
“I don’t want to see (the school divisions) held accountable for the money that they were promised for grants to do,” said Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt, who added he hopes the relief funds will be returned to the school divisions.
Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, added that school divisions could potentially “be on the hook for paying more costs than originally they thought” due to the changes and “left holding the bag” to absorb the costs.
Gullickson said she hopes Virginia’s requests will be favored, considering the administration’s connections to the federal agency and the shared interest in mitigating learning loss.
Already, VDOE has received an extension of $18 million for statewide tutoring services. Gullickson said federal approval of the request would allow schools to use “high-intensity” tutoring platforms specifically for reading and math through tutoring services such as Zearn, Ignite and Lexia for the upcoming school year.
The Mercury contacted the U.S. Department of Education for comment last week; the department has yet to respond.
 SNAP costs on the horizon?

The committee received the update on the education initiatives as it weighs multiple areas of cost concerns due to the federal changes by President Donald Trump’s administration that stand to impact the state’s economic standing and benefit programs, which the commonwealth could soon be responsible for covering.
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

Virginia could also have to pick up a $540 million expense to cover SNAP, also referred to as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, lawmakers learned at the meeting. The government initiative that provides monthly food benefits to low-income people and families could come with a price tag for states for the first time, if a GOP-led plan to slash federal spending succeeds.
“We’re going to be faced with some challenges, but what we’ve done over the past few years is tried to put as much money as possible in reserves so that we will be in a position and a posture to address some of the requirements that will be handed over to the state,” said House Appropriations Committee Chair Luke Torian, D-Prince William, told to the Mercury.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)From a podium in Concord’s Legislative Office Building Tuesday morning, Kristina Amyot spoke about her intense struggles with substance use disorder, which included incarceration and bouncing between treatment centers that allowed her to stay only 28 days. That was “nowhere near enough time,” she said, but Medicaid “changed that,” providing a foundation for Amyot to rebuild her life.
Now, she and other Medicaid proponents are making a last-minute push to persuade lawmakers to pull back from structural changes to the program.
Currently, negotiators with the Republican-majority New Hampshire House and Senate are working to hash out their differences and put together a final proposal for the state budget. As part of that process, lawmakers are eyeing changes to the state’s Medicaid program that are meant to save money and restructure how it operates. During Tuesday’s press conference, Medicaid proponents argued the proposals would be disastrous.
One of those changes is a Senate-proposed plan to add work requirements to Medicaid, which provides health coverage to those with low incomes and unique needs. That plan, originally a standalone bill, has been incorporated into the Senate’s budget proposal but is not in the House’s spending plan. 
The Republicans behind the plan argue work requirements will encourage people to work and eventually earn enough money to no longer need Medicaid. While debating the proposal in March, Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican, said Medicaid “should be a bridge for non-aged, non-disabled adults, not a destination.”
“We are a state that prides itself on work to support our families, independence, and self-sufficiency,” Pearl said in a Senate floor speech.
Speakers at Tuesday’s press conference argued work requirements would place an insurmountable bureaucratic burden on recipients and that they don’t take into account the unique medical challenges many of these recipients experience. Melinda Asbury, chief medical officer and interim CEO at Monadnock Family Services, spoke about the substance use disorder patients they treat in Keene.
“A Medicaid work requirement that is mandating work across the board simply is not going to work because these diseases do not work that way,” Asbury said. “People have times of health, and people have times of illness, and it is impossible to predict where someone is going to be at any point in time along the recovery journey.”
She said when a patient slips into these times of illness, they become less able to work, but their need for coverage increases. She pointed to “supported employment” programs that are designed to help people in recovery get into jobs as soon as their health allows as more effective ways to get people working. These programs have been proven to work and are offered at all 10 of New Hampshire’s community mental health and certified behavioral health centers, she said.
“I’ve heard a lot about exceptions,” Asbury continued. “And in theory, these sound good, right? It’s great to have an exception, but do not let that be a safety point. Let’s play this through just a little bit. So if someone is able to get an exception, then that means that that person has to be so seriously ill that they are unable to work. When someone is unable to work, what do we think the likelihood is that that person is going to be able to do this amount of paperwork and follow the process necessary in order to qualify for an exemption? To me, that just does not make sense.”
Asbury and her fellow speakers argued the paperwork will be a problem for all types of patients.
“The burden of proof does fall on a patient,” she said. “A patient who at that point in time may not be capable of advocating for him or herself. And the other burden will fall on community mental health centers to consistently have to approve work hours or apply for exemptions and certify that an individual at that point in time indeed cannot work.”
New Hampshire has attempted Medicaid work requirements before, in 2018. During that attempt, the fears Asbury and her colleagues described Tuesday seem to have been realized. 2018’s bill mandated Medicaid recipients work 100 hours a month to receive coverage. However, about one month after it went into effect in 2019, then-Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, intervened after only about 8,000 of the 25,000 people subject to the requirement complied and documented their hours, the Associated Press reported. Sununu paused the new system before the remaining roughly 17,000 people lost coverage. The state had spent more than $130,000 in outreach efforts to inform recipients of the requirements.
Two more Medicaid changes proposed this year came from Gov. Kelly Ayotte. In February, as part of her budget agenda, Ayotte proposed charging premiums to some Medicaid recipients. The recipients in question — those who have children and earn 255% of the federal poverty level and those without children who earn between 100% and 138% of the poverty level — would be charged up to 5% of their household income in order to receive coverage. Ayotte also proposed increasing pharmacy cost sharing. This means increasing the co-pays — the amount Medicaid recipients contribute to pay for their prescriptions — from $1 or $2 to $4 per prescription.
Ayotte has defended the plan by pointing to how expansive New Hampshire’s Medicaid eligibility is compared to other states. Indeed, the state ranks fourth (tied with Connecticut) among U.S. states and territories for most expansive income eligibility requirements for children, as of January, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Ayotte also proposed a provision allowing people experiencing hardship relief from premiums.
The House agreed with Ayotte’s proposal and implemented it in its budget proposal. When it became the Senate’s turn to review and amend the budget, it made some slight changes. Instead of capping the premiums based on income, the Senate changed this proposal to a flat fee regardless of income. Under that plan, single people with no kids would pay $60 per month; households of two would pay $80; households of three would pay $90; and households of four or more would pay $100.
That proposal, like work requirements, is a subject of negotiations during the committee of conference this week. Because both chambers passed premiums and co-pays, the debate will likely center around the different mechanisms for charging premiums. Still, speakers at the press conference Tuesday urged lawmakers to change course and eliminate these plans altogether.
Andrew Harmon, who is disabled and has unique medical needs as a result, spoke Tuesday about how Medicaid helps him afford the expensive medications he needs to deal with those medical needs. Harmon lives in rural New Hampton and works remotely as an independent contractor for a Canadian company, he said. He also receives disability insurance. 
“I never know what my actual income is going to be from month to month outside of my disability insurance,” Harmon said. “So I will never be able to plan for it if they go with the ‘up to 5%’ of my income. I’ve had some months where I barely get a little bit more than the disability insurance. I’ve had other months where I’ve made almost $500 on top of the insurance. So I would never know how much of that I need to set aside, nor would I know who I would pay it to.”
Harmon also said the cost alone would create a big financial burden, and there hasn’t been guidance on many of the specifics. He’s confused by how it will work. He said he’s not sure if he will be charged $4 per testing strip he uses to check his glucose levels in light of his diabetes or if he’ll be charged $4 for all the testing strips together.
“I would be paying a lot more, probably my entire money that I make for my job, probably a good portion of my disability insurance on top of that,” he said. “Which means I wouldn’t be able to afford my rent, I wouldn’t be able to afford groceries, and I definitely wouldn’t be able to afford if I needed to travel because of how rural (it is) where I live.”
Harmon is blind and cannot drive himself.
One Medicaid proposal that appears to now be off the table is a 3% cut to reimbursement rates. When it approved its budget proposal in April, the House voted to reduce Medicaid reimbursement rates — the rate at which providers get paid for services they provide Medicaid patients — by 3%. After a testy public hearing that saw residents repeatedly lambaste the cut and Ayotte publicly calling for it to go, the Senate reversed the cut in its version of the budget. On Monday, the House’s negotiators agreed to accede to the Senate’s position and reverse the cuts. So long as the full House agrees with the negotiators and neither Ayotte nor the Senate change their minds, the 3% cut now appears unlikely.
The House and Senate committees of conference must complete their negotiations this week, and the full chambers must vote on the final budget bills, House Bill 1 and House Bill 2, by June 26.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6174006-Medicaid-press-conference-1-scaled-e1750203686810-1024x713.jpg,,,2025-06-18 05:58:31.182010

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)While on her way home from a coworking space in Denver last year, Colorado state Rep. Jenny Willford says she was sexually assaulted by her Lyft driver.
In her lawsuit filed against Lyft in January, Willford alleges she was “subjected to unwelcome, nonconsensual sexual contact, touching” and lewd comments during the ride.
Willford was picked up by a different driver than the person identified in the Lyft app, according to the suit.
Her experience — and those that other survivors shared with her after hearing her story — prompted Willford, a Democrat, to introduce legislation this year that aimed to require safety measures for both riders and drivers using ridesharing apps.
“In my mind, all of these things are very basic when it comes to safety,” Willford said. “They’re just so common sense that it’s been really disheartening and frustrating to me that Uber … threatened to leave the state if the bill becomes law.”
Her bill would have required rideshare companies to conduct more regular background checks for drivers, to create a program for passengers or drivers who want to audio or video record their rides and to develop other safety policies.
But following Uber’s threats to leave the state if the measure passed, Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed it in late May. The bill would jeopardize rideshare services in Colorado “to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers,” his veto letter said.
Colorado isn’t alone. State and city leaders across the country are looking for ways to make rideshares safer. But lobbying campaigns from Uber and Lyft in many cases are blocking legislation meant to strengthen protections for both drivers and passengers.
Uber and Lyft, the two companies that dominate the U.S. rideshare industry, argue they have sufficient safety features within their apps.
“At Uber, we put safety at the heart of our operations, using technology, transparency, and accountability to help protect riders, drivers, and the broader community, with robust background checks and safety features like Audio and Video Recording, the Emergency Button, PIN verification, and RideCheck,” Uber wrote in a statement to Stateline.
“We remain committed to this work, and to dialogue with bill sponsors on sensible policies that keep people safe while protecting privacy and access.”
Rideshare drivers win more benefits, protections despite industry pushback

But there’s still a gap in regulations for rideshare companies because of their evolving technologies, said Lorena Roque, the interim director of education, labor and worker justice at The Center for Law and Social Policy, a left-leaning anti-poverty advocacy organization.
“Working on an app-based platform — like with delivery workers and rideshare workers —that sort of work is relatively new, so there’s not a clear standard,” Roque said.
Uber and Lyft are employing lobbyists at the state and local levels. In Rhode Island, another state where legislators are pushing rideshare safety bills that the companies have objected to, Uber is on pace to spend $50,000 this year on lobbyists, according to the state’s lobbying database. Lyft has been spending $5,000 monthly on lobbyists in Rhode Island.

Across the country, Uber and Lyft have testified against measures in state legislative hearings and city council meetings. In Colorado’s case, a number of officials representing Uber spoke out against Willford’s legislation at committee hearings, while Lyft sent a letter to Gov. Polis urging him to veto it. Jerry Golden, Lyft’s chief policy officer, wrote in the letter that the legislation’s requirements “ignore and ultimately will not improve conditions for riders and drivers.”
Uber told the state Senate it would be “impossible” for rideshare companies to comply with the bill’s requirements immediately upon approval and that the  audio and video requirement is “not possible to enforce.”
“The intention of my legislation was never to drive out Uber or Lyft,” Willford said. “The intention was always to require a higher level of accountability and safety from them. But we can’t do that if they’re going to throw tantrums and pick up their toys and go home every time somebody asks them to do better.”
 Safety for passengers

As a part of Lyft’s safety measures, drivers must complete annual background checks and mandatory driver safety education. The app is also programmed to check in with riders when drivers take long stops or deviate from the route they were assigned.
Uber conducts periodic criminal screenings for all active drivers and requires drivers to regularly verify their identity by sharing a selfie with Uber using the app. Both companies offer live emergency assistance to riders.
Between 2020 and 2022, Lyft reported 23 fatal physical assaults of people using the Lyft platform and 2,651 instances of the five most serious categories of sexual assault, according to its 2024 Safety Transparency Report. While incidents of sexual assault had decreased 21% since the last report, which covered 2017-2019, fatal physical assaults jumped by 185%.
Uber saw 36 physical assault fatalities in 2021 and 2022 and 2,717 incidents of the most serious categories of sexual assault, according to the company’s most recent safety report. Despite a 22% decline in sexual assault and misconduct, there was an increase in fatal physical assaults since its 2019-2020 report.
State lawmakers in several states have tried to address rideshare safety concerns with varying degrees of success.
Pending legislation in New Jersey and Massachusetts aims to prevent sexual assault and misconduct against passengers.
The New Jersey measure would require rideshare companies to share information concerning sexual misconduct investigations into a driver and would allow companies to ban drivers during an investigation. It remains in committee.
The bill in Massachusetts, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Rausch, would create a specific criminal penalty for the sexual assault of a passenger by a rideshare driver. The bill also would deem any rideshare passenger incapable of consenting to any sexual contact during a ride.  A hearing on the bill took place yesterday.
“We need to be able to make sure that people are safe and that people can trust those kinds of spaces to be safe,” Rausch said.
States and cities eye stronger protections for gig economy workers

In May, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation that creates criminal penalties for impersonating a rideshare driver. Starting July 1, the crime counts as a second-degree misdemeanor. Uber supported the legislation.
But in Rhode Island, Lyft is pushing against legislation that would require fingerprinting as part of criminal background check. Brendan Joyce, the Lyft public policy manager, testified against the measure in April, saying the fingerprinting requirement relies on the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information System, which Joyce said has incomplete data. He also asserted that fingerprint checks “disproportionately impact and have potential discriminatory effects on communities of color.” Uber also testified against the proposal.
Rhode Island legislators introduced another measure that would prevent people under the age of 16 from using a rideshare service alone. Both bills are being held for further study.
 Driver protections

JC Muhammad, 57, has been a rideshare driver in and around Chicago since about 2016.
Now, he works full-time as an organizer for faith-based organizations and groups that support rideshare drivers, including The People’s Union, a membership-driven organization aimed at supporting workers in the city.
Muhammad was attacked by a passenger during a Lyft ride in 2022, he said. The passenger asked to borrow Muhammad’s phone and opened its Cash App. The passenger also hit him over the head twice, he said, and threw a brick at his car, denting the side.
“I was angry as hell,” Muhammad said. “I really wanted to engage the kid, but I said, ‘No, let me get back in my car.’”

After sharing the incident with Lyft, the company responded by saying it would not match him with that passenger again. But the person who rode with Muhammad did not match the profile of the person who originally requested the ride, he said.
Muhammad also said he couldn’t go to the police because he did not know the identity of the person who was in his car — and Lyft would not share the identity of the account holder who ordered the Lyft.
Uber and Lyft customers have the option to verify their account, but not everyone does, Muhammad said.
“That gives us some measure of comfort, but it really doesn’t do enough, especially when it comes to calling rides for other people,” Muhammad said. “The account holder may not be the actual passenger.”
Rideshare drivers across the country — especially those of color — are frequently harassed, according to a 2023 report from the Strategic Organizing Center. The center is a coalition of labor unions representing more than 2.5 million workers across the country.
The survey of over 900 app-based rideshare drivers found the majority had been verbally abused and more than a quarter of respondents were threatened with physical harm. Nearly 15% of the drivers were grabbed, groped or hit, according to the report.
There have been several incidents in Chicago where drivers are lured by a false account to a location where they are then robbed or attacked, said Deana Rutherford, the communications manager at the Chicago Gig Alliance, a subset of The People’s Lobby.
“These drivers just show up and they have no idea who’s about to get into their car,” Rutherford said. “And Uber doesn’t know who they are either.”
To address some of the safety and labor issues drivers were facing, the Chicago City Council began considering an ordinance backed by The People’s Lobby that would require passenger verification.
If passed, the ordinance would have also set a minimum wage for drivers, require companies to be more transparent about fares, have them disclose the details of driver account deactivations and more. Both Uber and Lyft initially opposed the ordinance. Uber warned the measure’s sponsor that the changes in pay rates would drive up costs for customers and force the company to cut 10,000 drivers, according to a letter Uber sent to a city alderman that was obtained by Stateline.
But Uber this week agreed to a deal that scraps Chicago’s ordinance in exchange for the company’s support for state legislation that would allow rideshare drivers to unionize, the Chicago Sun Times reported.

Rep. Julie von Haefen (D-Wake) posted a video Saturday on Facebook from the “No Kings” protests in North Carolina that included the image. She later removed the post, which came after a man shot two Minnesota lawmakers, and posted a statement Sunday saying it was “inappropriate,” and that she condemned “political violence in all forms.”
On Tuesday, she echoed that sentiment in person among her House colleagues.
“I realized that quickly and took the post down, and I want to apologize today,” von Haefen said. “I apologize to members of the House, to my constituents and to any North Carolinian who was offended.”
House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) responded briefly to the statement on the floor, telling members to “watch what we say in this body.”
“What you end up doing is putting yourself in danger and other members of this body,” Hall said.
Speaking to reporters after the remarks, Hall did not rule out further action against von Haefen, which could include a motion to censure.
“The body elected me as speaker, and ultimately the body decides on what consequences are for things,” Hall said. “I can agree one way or the other, but they can decide at the end of the day. I don’t know what folks’ reactions are yet to the apology.”
Prior to House debate Tuesday, von Haefen’s post had drawn outrage from North Carolina Republicans, and a response from the head of the state Democratic Party.

The rally, led by child advocacy group Groundwork Ohio, included not only advocacy groups and faith leaders, but also workers in child care and parents who have had to face their own battles with the costs of everything regarding having children.
Briayana Odeneal is a parent who also works in early childhood education. She spoke at the rally, flanked by her toddler daughter. While she said she loves being a mother, she is always reminded that motherhood “does not come with a manual or any guarantees,” and “for a lot of us, it does not come with financial stability.”
“Not because of a lack of effort, but because the cost of living doesn’t always match the reality of raising a child,” Odeneal said.

Things like Publicly Funded Child Care, the Child Care Choice Voucher Program, and a child tax credit are ways in which the state can boost families and take away some of the struggle, according to those at the rally.
The cost and lack of access to child care, along with the low wages and high turnover of being a child care provider, have long been sore spots in the state and country, and those that attended the rally say more must be done.
“The supports that (working families) get for child care and the (child care choice) voucher program, for home visiting and all of those things, are really critical for them to be able to stay employed and participate in the workforce, as well as then for the children to be ready for kindergarten,” said Gina Ginn, CEO of Columbus Early Learning Centers.
Ginn attended the rally to encourage legislators and emphasize the need for reinforcements for issues ranging from infant and maternal mortality rates to pre-natal care and child care.
“It’s a conversation that we’re still having every budget cycle, and if our elected officials really believe in families and want families to move to Ohio, to stay in Ohio and to thrive in Ohio, we really need the support for working families, so they can build a life here,” Ginn said.

The budget is currently in conference committee, a joint gathering of both chambers of the General Assembly to harmonize the House and Senate drafts of the budget, on the way to a signature and/or line-item vetoes from the governor.
Both the House and Senate proposals left the Publicly Funded Child Care eligibility at 145% of the federal poverty limit, rather than raising it to 160% as advocates had asked for, to allow for more families to use the benefits.
The Child Care Choice Voucher Program remained in the budget through the Senate draft, but funding for the program dropped from $225 million over the biennium as was proposed in the governor’s budget, down to a total of $200 million.
The House and Senate proposals also both removed a provision from Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive proposal that would have created a child tax credit through the use of tobacco tax revenues. The credit could be used for many things related to care for a child, and would give $1,000 per child in tax relief.
While legislative leaders weren’t convinced by the use of what they see as a fading revenue stream in the tobacco tax, organizations and individuals from around the state put their support behind the measure to bring about some financial relief, and economists said the measure could bring the state itself millions of dollars in extra funds.
While the conference committee marks an imminent end to the budget process, Lynanne Gutierrez, president and CEO of Groundwork Ohio, is still optimistic that movements to change the language can make a difference, especially with the finish line marked by DeWine’s approval.
“I have a lot of hope in Gov. DeWine’s really front-stage advocacy on the child tax credit,” Gutierrez said.  “He’s continued to really voice that very loudly, being a leader in the space, so I believe that our legislative leaders can make that a priority, too. There’s revenue for it, if they choose to do it.”
Legislators have until the end of June to approve and present DeWine with a final draft.

The foundation analyzed 50 health indicators for all 50 states plus the District of Columbia. In the six categories into which the report divided the indicators, Arkansas ranked:

42nd in health care access and affordability
41st in prevention and treatment of health problems
36th in avoidable hospital use and cost
49th in healthy behaviors
36th in health disparities based on income
48th in health disparities based on race and ethnicity

Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi are the three states the Commonwealth Fund ranked below Arkansas overall. The organization advocates for equitable health care and provides grants for health research and improvements.
In a press briefing Tuesday, the authors of the report said they believe proposed federal cuts to public benefits, primarily Medicaid, will worsen the health care landscape and undo years’ worth of progress improving health outcomes and insurance rates. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, part of the Casey Foundation’s KIDS COUNT network, expressed similar concerns earlier this month after the Annie E. Casey Foundation released a report ranking Arkansas 45th in child well-being nationwide.
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

A federal budget bill moving through Congress would reduce Medicaid spending by $625 billion over 10 years. Arkansas was the first Southern state to expand Medicaid in 2013, but it is among the states with a trigger law to end the expansion program if federal funding for Medicaid is reduced.
More than 800,000 Arkansans are on Medicaid, and more than half are children.
The federal budget bill would also add new Medicaid work requirements for some non-disabled adults. AACF has repeatedly denounced such requirements, and Wednesday’s report asserted that working adults would lose Medicaid coverage under such requirements “because of the known difficulties associated with submitting documentation, filing paperwork, and securing internet access.”
About 5 million Americans could become uninsured as a result, report co-author Sara Collins said.
Arkansas became the first state to implement a work requirement for some Medicaid recipients in 2018, but a federal judge struck down the policy the following year. The initiative cut 18,000 people’s Medicaid coverage.
Additionally, the budget bill’s proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act, including a reduced open enrollment period and the expiration of pandemic-era subsidies for care plans under this law would lead to even more people losing insurance coverage, Collins said.
“When people go to the marketplace in November [2026], they are going to see their premiums spike,” she said. “They will see major increases in their premiums, so we’ll potentially see dropoffs in enrollment pretty quickly.”

Arkansas_EMBARGOED_2025-06-18 
Every state saw a decrease in its uninsured adults between 2013 and 2023, and the Affordable Care Act was a major contributor to this, the report states. Arkansas’ uninsured rate nearly halved, from 24.2% to 12.5%, during that time.
Arkansas also saw fewer instances of avoidable hospital use and cost from 2019 to 2023, according to the report, particularly for Medicare beneficiaries, who are at least 65 years old.
However, 3% more children in Arkansas were uninsured in 2023 compared to 2019, and there was no change in the proportion of uninsured adults in Arkansas during that time, according to the report.
Almost every state saw fewer adults forgo medical care due to the cost between 2013 and 2023. Arkansas’ rate dropped from 21% to 13.9%, according to the report.
Nationally, the percentage of working-age adults without health insurance fell from 20.4% in 2013 to 11% in 2023, and the percentage of adults that skipped medical care because of the cost declined from 15.9% to 11.7%, the report states.
 Child health

The report notes that fewer children have been receiving all seven recommended early childhood vaccinations against infectious diseases in 36 states, including in Arkansas. In 2019, 73.9% of Arkansas children had received all of these vaccines, but this percentage dropped to 67.1% by 2023, the report states.
“In some instances, children start the vaccine series but don’t receive all doses — sometimes because they lack health insurance coverage,” the report states. “Children living in poverty or in rural areas are less likely to complete the vaccination series, with access-related barriers and logistical challenges key contributors to their lower vaccination rates.”
Vaccine hesitancy also has grown nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Report co-author Kristen Kolb said Tuesday that the federal government’s recent actions and rhetoric “could further erode the public’s confidence in vaccines.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly expressed doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines, and earlier this month he removed and replaced the entire Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel that advises national vaccine policies.
Kolb called this a “serious disruption,” noting that the panel might not recommend that insurers pay for vaccinations.
Arkansas is one of several states that has seen the recent community spread of measles, a disease once considered eliminated by herd immunity thanks to vaccination rates.
Wednesday’s report notes that the CDC no longer recommends COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women, despite evidence that this demographic is “at greater risk for severe complications” from the illness.
Maternal and infant mortality rose nationwide between 2018 and 2022, and Arkansas consistently has high rates of both. The report ranked Arkansas 49th in infant mortality with a rate of 7.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to the national average of 5.6.
Arkansas stuck among bottom five states for child well-being, report shows

The Casey Foundation’s report earlier this month stated that Arkansas’ rate of child and teen deaths worsened from 2019 to 2023, totaling 300 per 100,000.
More broadly, Arkansas’ rate of premature deaths from preventable causes per 100,000 people worsened over roughly the same time period, from 230.9 to 259.6, according to the Commonwealth Fund.
The report also noted racial disparities in health outcomes. The rate of Black people in Arkansas per 100,000 who died before the age of 75 from preventable causes in 2020-21 was 405.6, compared to 316.2 among white people, 225.5 among Asian Americans and 203.4 among Hispanic people.
Similarly, infant mortality for Black babies in Arkansas was 12.8 per 1,000 live births, compared to 7.2 for white babies, 5.7 for Asian American babies and 4.6 for Hispanic babies, according to the report.
The report’s overall analysis of Arkansas’ health landscape paints “a complicated and mixed picture,” Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families economic policy director Pete Gess said in a Tuesday email. He noted infant mortality and decreasing child vaccination rates as particularly concerning. He also said the state government will likely be required to direct more public funding to Medicaid, nutrition assistance and other “basic needs programs” in the face of federal budget cuts.
“All of these changes create stress for children and families in our state, and we can expect diminishing health outcomes,” Gess said.

However, it’s one of two Ohio “nonprofit” hospital systems to face scrutiny from Congress over the huge amounts it’s raking in from a federal program meant to subsidize care for the poor. 
It’s using some of that money to pay lavish salaries and buy stadium-naming rights. Meanwhile, it is reportedly boosting the bottom line by serving wealthy communities and neglecting poorer ones — an outcome that, if true, would directly counter the program’s intent.
In April, the U.S. Senate Health, Labor and Pensions Committee released the results of a years-long investigation it made into a federal program that has exploded over the past 15 years. Among the committee’s concerns was that there appeared to be few — if any — controls on the way hospitals, clinics, and contract pharmacies spend the billions they receive from the program.
And it singled out two Ohio-based hospital chains for special focus — Cleveland Clinic and Bon Secours Mercy Health. 
“These hospitals were selected for this investigation as a result of media reports alleging abuse of the 340B Program, such as hospitals cutting services to underserved populations and expanding into affluent areas to increase reimbursement rates and subsequent revenue under the 340B Program,” the committee report said.
The committee’s findings about Cleveland Clinic, which received nearly $1 billion from the program over a 38-month period, are detailed here. 
Ohio’s Cleveland Clinic faces questions over booming subsidies

The report focused on Bon Secours Mercy Health because of media reports that it had gained 340B status from a hospital it owns in a poor, Black neighborhood in Richmond, Va. It steadily depleted resources at that hospital, while adding them at facilities in more affluent neighborhoods nearby, the reporting said.
Bon Secours Mercy Health didn’t respond to requests for comment. But observers said such conduct is likely happening elsewhere in the 50-hospital chain.
Explosive growth
Intended to subsidize care for the needy, the 340B program has grown from $5 billion a year in 2010 to nearly $67 billion in 2023, and analysts say that growth is only accelerating.
The program works by requiring drugmakers to give deep discounts off of list prices for drugs to qualifying hospitals, clinics, and the pharmacies with which they contract. Those entities are then allowed to charge insurers and uninsured customers the full list price and pocket the difference.
The idea behind 340B was to help providers with a large share of uninsured and Medicaid patients make ends meet while they shoulder the cost of uncompensated and under-compensated care.
Cleveland Clinic claimed last month that the program has no impact on taxpayers. But Antonio Ciaccia, a Columbus-based drug-pricing analyst, said the program creates billions in higher costs for insurers and ultimately consumers.
After Congress created the Medicaid Prescription Drug Rebate Program in 1990, it created 340B in 1992, requiring drugmakers to give discounts to qualifying hospitals and clinics that were equal to the Medicaid rebates.
The program grew relatively slowly until passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, when rules changes allowed a lot more entities to qualify. It’s since grown by leaps and bounds and is now the second-largest federal prescription-drug program, behind only Medicare Part D.
Growing numbers of hospital systems have joined the 340B program through seemingly giant loopholes.
Cleveland Clinic, for example, doesn’t admit enough Medicaid and uninsured patients to qualify under the original 340B rules. But under a quirk in the new rules, it was allowed in as a “rural-referral center” even though it’s headquartered in the middle of a big city.
Rural referral centers have lower barriers to qualify and are the fastest-growing type of 340B hospitals. Possibly indicating abuse, by 2022, 82% of so-called “rural referral centers” were located in urban areas, as were 77% of their patients, according to the Berkeley Research Group, a consulting firm.
Intended outcome?
Facilities owned by another Ohio-based group — Bon Secours Mercy Health — qualified another way. Its Richmond Community Hospital in Virginia is located in a low-income Black neighborhood in the city’s East End, where it qualifies as a federal “disproportionate share” hospital and thus for the 340B program.
However, the New York Times reported in 2022 Bon Secours Mercy Health hollowed out Richmond Community, closing its intensive care unit, its maternity ward, and other vital departments. 
At the same time, it created legal connections between the hospital and other clinics it owned in wealthier parts of town so that they could get 340B drug discounts. In those facilities it could reap a greater percentage of the 340B benefit because more patients are privately insured. That’s because transactions involving Medicaid patients aren’t eligible for the discount.
The paper reported on the perverse outcome of Bon Secours Mercy Health’s practices: It stripped its hospital in a poor neighborhood of resources while it used money meant for it to build and renovate lavish facilities where few poor people went.
“Bon Secours was basically laundering money through this poor hospital to its wealthy outposts,” Dr. Lucas English, who worked at Richmond Community until 2018, told the Times. “It was all about profits.”
For participating hospitals, the profits can be huge. 
Bon Secours Mercy Health collected $276 million in 340B benefits over a five-year period that ended in 2023, the Senate committee reported. That was just for the facilities that participate in 340B under Richmond Community’s designation — not those connected to any of the chain’s dozens of other hospitals that might separately be part of the 340B program.

Questionable spending
Some critics who want to see reform say there must be greater controls over how money collected under the program is spent. As it is, there don’t appear to be any.
Bon Secours Mercy Health and Cleveland Clinic told Senate investigators that they simply put the money into their general revenue and don’t specifically account for it after that.
As tens of billions more flow each year into hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies that participate in 340B, some are accused of spending on things that have nothing to do with health care — much less health care for the poor.
For example, how much New York University’s Langone Hospitals receive from the 340B program is not publicly available, but the number surely isn’t small. The system raised eyebrows when it spent an estimated $8 million advertising itself during the Super Bowl. 
Bon Secours paid more than $4 million for the naming rights of a Greenville, S.C. sports arena, claiming it would produce better health outcomes for the community.
“We’ve truly used this collaboration to expand our reach beyond hospital walls and live out our mission of building healthier communities, which is why we are very excited to extend this partnership and continue working together to make a difference in our community for many years to come,” Mark Caldwell, an executive with the 340B hospital, said in a written statement.
How the community would be made healthier by the arena’s food and beverage offerings isn’t obvious.
“The arena proudly offers Carolina Smoke BBQ, Well Pressed and Swamp Dog food stands, Reedy River Roost (our in house fried chicken shop!), GVL Pizza, Moe’s Southwest Grill, Pepsi products, and a nice selection of craft beer, domestic beer, and wine,” says the arena’s website, which has a picture of a bartender pouring gin into a cup.
Mercy Health also held the naming rights to the Lake Erie Crushers baseball stadium in Avon, Ohio, until last year. Mercy Health Lorain Hospital, 12 miles away, is a 340B facility.
Community benefit
Nonprofit hospitals receiving huge amounts from 340B aren’t just facing questions about whether they’re using those funds in the best interest of the poor and uninsured. Nonprofit hospitals generally have been coming under fire as analyses have shown that most are not providing community services that are commensurate with the huge tax breaks they enjoy. 
Theoretically, institutions are given tax exemptions in exchange for providing community benefits, but in Ohio most nonprofit hospitals receive more than they give, according to a recent analysis. 
Nonprofit hospitals have an obligation to help their communities

The nonpartisan Lown Institute this year reported that Ohio’s nonprofit hospitals get $2.2 billion annually in tax breaks. Yet nearly three quarters (74%) of them provide less than that in community service, the report said. 
That creates a $1.3 billion annual “fair share” deficit — the second-highest of the 20 states studied, the report said. Cleveland Clinic was the biggest offender in the state, with a $207 million annual deficit. That also qualified as the fifth-highest among any hospital in the 20 states, the report said.
Some of these “nonprofit” hospitals are also paying their top brass huge salaries. In the case of Bon Secours Mercy Health, CEO John Starcher Jr. made $8.8 million in reportable compensation in 2023 and an estimated $3.5 million more in “other compensation from the organization and related organizations,” the nonprofit’s IRS Form 990 says. The resulting $12.3 million is 176 times the median household income in Ohio.
The Economic Research Institute in 2022 put Starcher among the 10 highest-paid nonprofit CEOs in the country. The average nonprofit CEO made much less — just $152,199, the report said.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)FirstEnergy’s former in-house lobbyist Justin Biltz took the stand Tuesday in a utility commission hearing about House Bill 6 — the bill at the heart of Ohio’s utility political bribery and corruption scandal.
His testimony filled in some of the details of what prompted the company to bribe former Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Chair Sam Randazzo.
“The Ohio hole”
Sometime before 2019, FirstEnergy realized it had a problem. As a regulated monopoly, the company set rates in hearings before the PUCO. But it was becoming clear that FirstEnergy wouldn’t be able to justify rates as high as it currently charged when it went back before regulators.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Biltz explained they had a special name for it.
“The Ohio hole,” Biltz described, “was the difference in revenues that were established from the company’s last base distribution case as compared to what the company could justify if it were to go in for another rate case in 2024 and the difference being that it would have been a lower amount.”
Concerns about that lower rate led Biltz and other FirstEnergy employees to start working on different strategies to fill in that hole.
“There was a broad kind of working group at the company who were coming up with these different options that could be put in front of Mr. Randazzo,” Biltz explained. “I don’t recall him arriving at any conclusion in any of those meetings, but rather, the information was presented and he had it.”
Biltz acknowledged FirstEnergy executives wanted to see Randazzo installed as PUCO chair, but said they simply saw him as a person with “subject matter expertise” who could “bring some stability to the agency.”
Biltz described at least three meetings between himself, FirstEnergy Vice President Michael Dowling, and Randazzo at Randazzo’s home in Columbus, his condo in Cuyahoga Falls, and a FirstEnergy office.
These meetings occurred around the time Randazzo was tapped to lead the PUCO but prior to his term officially beginning.
“Was it your understanding at the time,” Ohio Consumers’ Counsel attorney Thomas Brodbeck asked, “that it was okay for yourself and others at FirstEnergy to discuss business that would be before Mr. Randazzo as chairperson of the PUCO, with Mr. Randazzo, so long as those discussions occurred before he was seated as chief?”
“Yeah, that was my understanding,” Biltz said. “That as long as his term had not yet started, that the company’s lawyers were involved and seemed okay with it.”
But that wasn’t the last of communications between the company and Randazzo. Evidence in the case is littered with text messages between FirstEnergy executives describing interaction with Randazzo, and even a few with Randazzo himself. Biltz said he was unaware of those at the time.
Still, there was at least one apparent incident he knew about.
“Is it your understanding that Mr. Randazzo helped FirstEnergy draft House Bill 6?” Ohio Manufacturing Association attorney Kim Bojko asked.
“I can recall being on a conference call with Mr. Randazzo during the legislative drafting process, there were several other internal employees, discussing some of the language in House Bill 6,” Biltz said. “I think we were sharing different language approaches. I don’t recall exactly the outcome of that and whether you’d consider that helping FirstEnergy.”
Randazzo officially assumed his post as PUCO chairman on April 11, 2019. House Bill 6 was filed the very next day.
Biltzer didn’t put a date on the conference call he described, but FirstEnergy’s deferred prosecution agreement describes Randazzo having a direct hand in the legislative efforts in June and July of 2019. The measure passed in late July.
The payments
On Jan. 30, 2019, an “urgent and confidential” request went out to the accounting team at FirstEnergy. Could they track down any payments to an organization called ‘Sustainability Funding Alliance’ — or something like that? The following day, the ask was expanded to include ‘McNees Wallace’ and ‘Randazzo.’
Sustainability Funding Alliance was a consulting firm controlled by Randazzo, and McNees Wallace was the law firm he worked for.
Gov. Mike DeWine tapped Randazzo to lead the PUCO on Feb. 4 that year.
Biltz explained the internal review started up in response to a reporter’s request. They’d found a connection to Sustainability Funding Alliance in bankruptcy proceedings for a subsidiary called FirstEnergy Solutions.
“In late January 2019, Mike Dowling had asked or informed me that this was a contract that was being managed out of the legal department,” Biltz said. “He wanted to know exactly how much had been paid to that entity over time, and by which entities those costs were being allocated to.”
The review found FirstEnergy had paid almost $20 million to Sustainability Funding Alliance since 2010, including “a 4.3 million lump sum that was paid in December 2018.”
Brodbeck emphasized the timeline — lump sum payment in December, and Randazzo’s appointment to the PUCO two months later in February.
“Do you know what that lump sum was for?” he asked Biltz.
Biltz insisted, “I was never involved in any discussions regarding that lump sum.”
Brodbeck pressed on, asking whether those dollars got passed along to consumers.
“I was not able to determine that,” he said. “I knew which entities they were allocated to, but whether they eventually made it into rates or riders, that was not something that I had been asked to look into and did not.”
As for whether the expenses were applied to Ohio utility companies, Biltz acknowledged that they had.
Brodbeck asked if the company had discussed concealing the records from the public or sharing them with the PUCO.
“Not to my knowledge,” Biltz said.

The changes would be implemented starting Jan. 1, 2033. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“As of the last Census, the size of these districts in terms of population are roughly 358,000 and 119,000, respectively,” Blessing said Tuesday to the Senate General Government Committee during his sponsor testimony. “Smaller districts more firmly anchor legislators to their districts. They would represent fewer communities and constituents, and could devote more time to them.”
Legislative redistricting next occurs in 2031. 
“Should SJR 1 be put on the ballot and passed, I strongly believe that the proportion of Republicans to Democrats would more closely approach proportional representation through no other means than mathematics,” Blessing said. 
Seventeen senators’ four-year terms are set to begin in 2031 and 16 senators’ four-year terms are scheduled to begin in 2033. The proposal would keep the Senate’s term limit the same at four years in the long run. In order for that to happen, 34 senators would be up for election in 2032 with eight of them for a two-year term. 
“However, this is only temporary and will not count against their term limits,” Blessing said. 
State Sen. Willis E. Blackshear Jr., D-Dayton, asked about how much increasing lawmaker membership would cost the legislature. 
“We have a $100 billion budget in this state,” Blessing said. “There is, in my opinion, no way that this would be more than low tens of millions of costs.” 
Blackshear also asked if the legislature would be more or less efficient in passing legislation? 
“I do think to some degree, it is going to be more difficult on leadership trying to herd the cats together,” Blessing said. “But in the end, hopefully you have more eyeballs on things. You have more subject matter experts.” 
Ohio, the seventh most populous state, has the fourth largest population state senate seats and sixth largest population state representative seats, Blessing said. 
“The average for all states is 161,000 and 61,000, respectively,” he said. “SJR 1, if it were law today, would mean Senate and House district sizes of roughly 232,000 and 77,000, respectively.”

The Senate has non-negotiables. The House responds that nothing is set in stone.
The room where it happens — six lawmakers are tasked with debating two very different Ohio budgets.
“Clearly, we could pretty quickly identify where there are some larger differences between the two,” Ohio House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said, but added that he didn’t think they were “miles apart.”
Only one budget will be passed by the end of June.
“It’s not unusual at all to have beginning conference meetings with some major differences between the two,” Ohio Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said, adding that the budgets have very large distinctions.
In February, Gov. Mike DeWine proposed his child care-centric budget, which is no longer being actively considered by the legislature.
In April, the House passed its conservative budget, mainly keeping funding levels the same for programs. However, the chamber slashed the expected education budget by hundreds of millions and changed Medicaid requirements and funding significantly.
And in June, the Senate passed its business-focused budget. It also added back in $100 million in school funding, and it cut Medicaid further.
It’s now time for common ground. Representing the Senate are Cirino, Finance Vice Chair Brian Chavez, R-Marietta, and Ranking Member Paula Hicks-Hudson, D-Toledo. The House team is comprised of Stewart, Finance Vice Chair Mike Dovilla, R-Berea, and Ranking Member Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake.
But just because Stewart and Cirino are from the same party doesn’t mean they will agree.
“There are some things that neither side will compromise on,” Cirino said.
One of those Senate non-negotiables is its 2.75% flat income tax, meaning the highest earners in the state, those making more than $100,000 a year, will no longer have to pay 3.5% in income tax, making them equal to the lower tax bracket.
“It’s going to put money in the hands of Ohioans,” Cirino said.
State data reveals that this could result in a loss of more than $1.1 billion in the general revenue fund. Stewart isn’t fully on board.
“We would like to see some income tax relief,” the House leader said. “I don’t know if we have the same view today that we need to get there entirely in this budget.”
The billion dollars would be made up by cutting a majority of social services that mainly benefit lower-income families, and specific provisions that House members put in to help their communities.
“I think that we prepared our budget based on what our members wanted to see. I certainly don’t begrudge the Senate preparing a budget based on what their members want to see,” Stewart said. “But now we’ve got to get to 50+ votes in the House, and I think that our members have an expectation that a lot of their priorities are going to be considered, and that’s what we’re going to fight for over the next week.”
The Senate also doesn’t want to compromise on its $600 million grant for the Cleveland Browns’ new stadium using unclaimed funds.
“There are some things that we believe in strongly,” Cirino said.
The House’s version proposed borrowing $600 million by issuing bonds. Speaker Matt Huffman, noting that he likes the Senate’s idea, raised questions about the other chamber’s proposal.
“The specifics of that seem to be vague,” he said, further referencing what the unclaimed funds could be used for in the future. “I don’t think they know all of the details of it yet.”
Sweeney, the House Democrats representative, said she is on the defensive.
“I actually have had very productive meetings, not on some of the big topics, [but] of how we can make real changes to some of the harmful provisions the Senate put in,” she said.
Last week, she said that she thinks both the House and the Senate’s budgets were bad, but that the Senate’s was worse.
At the end of the day, Stewart is confident he can push back against Cirino.
“I don’t call anything non-negotiable,” Stewart chuckled.
Cirino said that everyone on the committee respects each other, and there are policy differences, but the GOP is still on the same team.
“We’re going to work in good faith to resolve those differences,” Cirino said.
A final budget is expected to be passed next week.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)After the shootings of Minnesota state legislators and the apparent targeting of other officials, surely we can all agree that violence has no place in American politics.
Surely.
Yet what to make of the fact that President Donald Trump’s administration selected former Kansas Rep. Patrick Penn, R-Wichita, as the agriculture department’s deputy undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services? You might remember Penn as the legislator who spoke on the House floor about blowing away former Hutchinson Rep. Jason Probst with tank fire.
The entire exchange was captured on a video feed from the floor, which can be seen here.


 Kansas Republican Reps. Kyler Sweely (left) and Patrick Penn exchange words on Feb. 13, 2005, on the House floor.
Here’s how part of Penn’s conversation with and freshly minted Rep. Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson, went town.

Penn: “Now when we talk about the commands for firing, what are the components of a firing command?”
Sweely: “Identifying the target, the direction the target is, the range that the target is, and then the type of ammo that you’re going to use to address the target.”
Penn: “So if I were to come to you and say, I have a firing command, and that command is, ‘Gunner, sabot, that guy from Hutch in the open, fire for effect,’ what would you say?”
Sweely: “Gunner, sabot, that guy from Hutch.”
Penn: “All right, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you on his maiden voyage here before you as colleagues, that new guy from Hutch.”

Some quick background: Both representatives are veterans, and they bantered about the subject as part of a freshman hazing ritual. “That guy in Hutch” refers to Probst, who runs a Substack newsletter and podcast under that name. Sweely narrowly defeated Probst, a Democrat, in the November general election.
Neither Penn nor Sweely ever apologized for their words about the former representative, as far as I know. Likewise, no other Kansas Republicans condemned their violent rhetoric.
Now, we have an all-too-clear example of actual, honest-to-God political violence. Melissa Hartman, speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatves, and her husband were shot dead. Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded but survived. A suspect was arrested Sunday after a statewide search.
The violence gives every indication of being politically motivated. It follows other alarming examples, such as arson at Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home in April and an assassination attempt on Trump in July 2024. Back in 2023, a man was convicted of threatening then-U.S. Rep. Jake LaTurner after reading a Kansas Reflector news story.
No political party, no official benefits from the normalization of political violence. We all lose.
That makes Trump’s decision to employ Penn all the more baffling. The Kansas Statehouse includes many qualified members who didn’t joke about blowing away their former colleagues through tank fire. Our state boasts of richly gifted residents who have conducted themselves in exemplary fashion. No one made Washington, D.C., officials pick That Guy from Wichita.
Listen, I get it. Some readers will claim I’m overreacting, given that Penn’s comments were made in jest. But they still promised violence.
You either take that seriously or you don’t.
Trump apparently doesn’t. As one of his first actions in his second term, he pardoned 1,500 people who tried to overthrow the U.S. government and kill his vice president on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s threatened cities run by Democrats. He even refused to call Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after the recent shootings, calling him “whacked out” and “a mess.”
I have written before that Kansans and Americans should not censor ourselves to protect others’ feelings, and I still believe that’s true. Participants in our democracy require the freedom to write and speak forcefully, to condemn that which must be condemned, to call the powerful to account.
Yet all of us — in Kansas, in the United States — stand at the edge of a scary new age. Penn and his fellow lawmakers, up to and including Trump, are playing with fire. We must find ways to navigate these exceptional times while avoiding any more bloodshed.
Lest the flames rage out of control.

David Thomas put forth a bill that would give the authority to lower property taxes for local governments to county commissioners.
This is just one of a series of recent proposals in Ohio to reduce property taxes, including a bipartisan bill to reduce property taxes for low-income homeowners, an Ohio House plan to reduce property taxes for school districts with budget reserves at the end of the year, and a constitutional amendment to end property taxation in the state.
There are reasons for this change. Cost of construction has tamped down supply of housing, causing housing prices to rise quickly over the past decade. This has led to assessments that have driven property taxes up quickly relative to incomes.
What happens if Ohio reduces its property tax revenue? In 2022, local governments in Ohio collected $19 billion in property taxes according to the Annual Survey of Local Government Finance. This accounted for 63% of total tax revenue collected by local governments.
So if Ohio, in the extreme case, ended property taxes, what options would it have?
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A first option would be just to eat the loss. This would lead to a massive disinvestment of local governments. This means fewer police and firefighter services, large reductions in the number of schools, and rapid deterioration of roads and utility infrastructure. This would likely lead to a quick deterioration of quality of life in Ohio.
Another option would be to make these property taxes up with income taxes, local governments’ second-highest source of revenue. In 2022, local governments in Ohio raised $6.5 billion in income taxes. This means income tax rates would need to quadruple to make up the lost revenue from property taxes. Currently, these sorts of changes can happen by a vote of the public. 
So this means a resident of the City of Columbus, currently paying a 2.5% local income tax, would see their local income tax rate jump to 10%.
This could have some benefits. Income taxes are generally more broad-based than property taxes, so this provides some more economic efficiency. They also are more progressive than property taxes, which can be especially burdensome to low-income renters who bear the burden of property taxes levied on their landlords.
That being said, 10% local income taxes would be a lot for many residents to stomach.
A final option would be a land value tax. This is a tax that applies not to property, but to the value of the land the property is built upon. This sort of tax is popular among economists because it is economically efficient because it does not discourage improvement of land. 
It is also equitable because the burden of the tax falls on the landowner and since they cannot control the amount of land available the same way they can control the amount of homes available by building or choosing not to build on land they own.
The drawback of land value taxation? It would take significant change in Ohio’s current laws and possibly a constitutional amendment of its own.
The options for replacing property taxation are stark. As legislators and potentially the public make decisions that could erode property taxation in Ohio, they will need to think with clear heads about what the alternatives look like.

Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”
